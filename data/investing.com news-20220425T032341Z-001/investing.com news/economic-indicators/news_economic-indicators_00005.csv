0,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Holds on Interest Rates Amid Economic Concerns, Trade Conflicts","Investing.com – The Bank of Canada (BoC) kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday as it specifically warned of the damage to both confidence and the economy by pending trade disputes.
“While the sources of moderation appear to be multiple, trade tensions and uncertainty are weighing heavily on confidence and economic activity. It is difficult to disentangle these confidence effects from other adverse factors, but it is clear that global economic prospects would be buoyed by the resolution of trade conflicts,” the BoC said in its statement.
The BoC also said that conditions continue ""to warrant a policy interest rate that is below its neutral range."" 
Most analysts had expected no change in rates after Canada's gross domestic product growth slowed to 0.1% in the fourth quarter, its worst performance in two-and-a-half years.
That data showed consumer spending grew at the slowest pace in nearly four years, housing fell by the most in a decade, business investment dropped sharply for a second-straight quarter, while domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.
The BoC noted that the slowdown at the end of 2018 was ""sharper and more broadly based"" than it had forecast and now expects that the economy will be weaker in the first half of 2019 than it had projected back in January.
""It will take time to gauge the persistence of below-potential growth and the implications for the inflation outlook. With increased uncertainty about the timing of future rate increases, Governing Council will be watching closely developments in household spending, oil markets, and global trade policy,"" it concluded."

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 189,000 jobs last month.
January's private payrolls were revised up to an increase of 300,000 from the previously reported 213,000.

The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.

Economists had expected the report to show a gain of 189,000 jobs.
However, the shortfall was more than offset by a sharp upward revision to January's numbers. ADP now says private-sector jobs increased by 300,000 in January, rather than the 213,000 initially reported. 
The ADP numbers thus provide an upbeat prelude to the Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
The dollar was little changed after the report, immediately reversing a brief dip against the euro as the scale of the January revision was factored in."
4,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 12:47AM ET</span>",Australia GDP slowdown opens door wide for rate cuts this year,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's top central banker sounded sanguine about a sharp slowdown in the country's property market on Wednesday saying it was unlikely to derail momentum even as data showed the $1.3 trillion economy hit an airpocket last quarter.
Domestic activity slowed sharply in the second half of last year, the figures released on Wednesday showed, with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 0.2 percent in the December quarter following a sub-par 0.3 percent in the previous three-month period.
Annual GDP rose a below-trend 2.3 percent, the slowest pace since mid-2017 and confounding expectations for a 2.5 percent increase.
The dismal figures sent the Australian dollar to a two-month trough of $0.7029 as investors wagered the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would ease policy to stimulate the economy.
""We think rate cuts this year, while not guaranteed, are now more likely than not,"" said Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst in a report.
Ticehurst cited weak regional and global growth and debt-laden consumers in a deteriorating housing market among reasons for his bearish case. 
""We expect another round of material growth forecast reductions from the RBA and see an increasing risk that inflation continues to fall short of the target band for an extended period,"" he added.
Australia's top investment bank Macquarie also revised its rate outlook to two cuts this year from no change previously, as did JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). 
""With growth now below trend, the labor market will soon start softening. So, you can support the economy with further cuts,"" said Macquarie economist Ric Deverell. 
Interest rate futures have moved too, now pricing in a 100-percent chance of a cut to the 1.50 percent cash rate this year from an 86 percent probability on Tuesday. 
The RBA drifted away from its previous tightening bias last month to a neutral stance, although recent comments and reports from the central bank show the outlook on the economy remain broadly optimistic. It expects growth to pick up to around 3 percent this year, a forecast many economists believe will be downgraded in the months to follow. 
A revival in business investment, strong government spending, higher commodity prices and a still robust jobs market are among reasons for the RBA's optimism.
But dark clouds are now gathering as the house price slowdown hits dwelling investment and construction activity in Australia's two biggest cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The property downturn is also expected to further weigh on already-stretched household balance sheets.
At the same time, wage growth is slow and there is still a fair degree of spare capacity in the labor market.
On a per capita basis, GDP fell in December and September quarters, marking only the third time in the past 30 years per capita activity contracted for two consecutive quarters. The last time that happened was in 2006.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe still believes there is fire left in Australia's economy which has not had a recession since 1991.
""The adjustment in our housing market is manageable for the overall economy. It is unlikely to derail our economic expansion,"" he said in a speech in Sydney before the GDP data on Wednesday. 
While focussing on economic bright spots, Lowe emphasized current monetary policy settings were ""clearly stimulatory.""
""We have the flexibility to adjust monetary policy in either direction as required,"" he said. ""At the moment, the probabilities appear reasonably evenly balanced.""
FISCAL STIMULUS?
Defying the gloom, higher prices for Australia's resource exports boosted corporate profits and GDP in current dollar terms, which in turn provides a windfall to tax revenues.
As a result, nominal GDP climbed 1.2 percent in the quarter and a rapid 5.5 percent for the year.
The stellar nominal growth has led many economists to speculate the government will shower tax sweeteners on households, including one-off cash transfers ahead of state and federal elections in coming months.
""Fiscal stimulus is the key risk to our forecast for two rate cuts this year,"" said Sally Auld, Sydney-based chief economist at JPMorgan

""The government has a bit of spare money up its sleeve. If they deliver a large pre-election spending for households that will enable the RBA to stay on hold for the forseeable future.""

5,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",Australia's Economy Slows as Property Slump Hurts Construction,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy slowed in the final quarter of 2018 as a deepening property slump hurt construction and consumption remained subdued, with government spending the key support.
The data confirm an economic contradiction Down Under: while growth slowed sharply in the second half of last year, firms kept steadily hiring and investing. The growing divide between weak GDP and unemployment that’s fallen to 5 percent was noted in a speech earlier Wednesday by central bank chief Philip Lowe, who has kept interest rates unchanged at a record low since 2016.
“The economy lost considerable momentum in 2018, slowing from around a 4 percent annualized pace in the first half of the year to around a 1 percent pace in the second,’’ said Andrew Hanlan, a senior economist at Westpac Banking Corp. “This was centered on housing and the consumer against the backdrop of a further tightening of lending standards and persistent weak wages growth.’’
The Reserve Bank is honing in on household spending, which accounts for almost 60 percent of GDP. It’s remained subdued for the past two quarters amid signs that consumers are holding back in response to falling property prices and persistently weak wages.
Wednesday’s data showed the household savings ratio edged up to 2.5 percent from a revised 2.3 percent, suggesting Australians are salting away a bit more cash as their paper wealth declines.
The Australian dollar fell after today’s release, buying 70.60 U.S. cents at 12:52 p.m. in Sydney compared with 70.88 before the report.
Money markets are pricing in a likely rate cut by the end of the year. Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans and Nomura Holdings Inc.’s Andrew Ticehurst recently switched to predicting two cuts by year’s end.
Jobs Strength
Lowe has rejected the argument that the discrepancy between hiring and economic growth is because employment is a lagging indicator, pointing to record high job vacancies and RBA liaison with employers that supports a solid outlook for the labor market. For a rate cut to happen, it will require unemployment to begin rising.
Australia’s economy would’ve been in a worse position if not for the strength of public spending. Both national and state governments have opened their check-books as lower unemployment boosted the tax take and reduced expenses. The building of roads, bridges and railways has supported growth.
But a 3.4 percent decline in dwelling investment, which cut 0.2 percentage point from growth, suggests that the pipeline of residential projects that’s boosted employment could shorten as developers bow to the reality of insufficient demand and excess supply.
Overshadowing this is a looming budget next month and a likely election in May. The government is expected to shower tax cuts on the electorate to try to win over voters as opinion polls show the opposition Labor party on track to win office. At the same time, recent history suggests that firms tend to hold off on hiring near elections.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a $25 billion surplus for the month.
The Treasury said federal spending in January was $331 billion, up 6 percent from the same month in 2018, while receipts were $340 billion, down 6 percent compared to January 2018.
The deficit for the fiscal year to date was $310 billion, compared with $176 billion in the comparable period the year earlier.

When adjusted for calendar effects, the budget was in balance in January 2019, compared with a $30 billion surplus the prior year.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 01:17PM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales at seven-month high; services sector picks up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a seven-month high in December, but November's outsized jump was revised lower, pointing to continued weakness in the housing market.
While other data on Tuesday showed a rebound in growth in the vast services sector in February amid a surge in new orders, concerns about import tariffs, capacity constraints and labor shortages lingered. The trade dispute between the United States and China is among the factors that analysts say will contribute to slower economic growth this year.
Growth is softening as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending ebbs. The economy's outlook is also being clouded by slowing global growth and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union.
""GDP growth is currently on course to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. 
""With the fiscal boost having now faded and higher interest rates starting to take their toll, we expect a further slowdown over the course of this year.""
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,000 units, the highest level since May 2018. November's sales pace was revised down to 599,000 units from the previously reported 657,000 units. October's sales pace was also revised lower. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.2 percent of housing market sales, falling 8.7 percent to a pace of 600,000 units in December. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They fell 2.4 percent from a year ago. Single-family home sales rose 1.5 percent in 2018.
The release of the December report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. 
The housing market hit a soft patch last year amid higher mortgage rates, expensive lumber as well as land and labor shortages, which led to tight inventories and less affordable homes. Reports last month showed homebuilding dropping to more than a two-year trough in December and home resales in January hitting their lowest level since November 2015. 
Though house price inflation has slowed and mortgage rates are hovering at 12-month lows, economists expect the housing market to remain weak for a while because of persistent land and labor shortages. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.2 percent in 2018, the weakest performance since 2010.
In December, new home sales rose in the South, West and Northeast, but tumbled in the Midwest to their lowest level since April 2016. The median new house price fell 7.2 percent to $318,600 in December from a year ago. 
""This is consistent with other indicators that point to a gradual slowing in housing sector activity,"" said Pooja Sriram, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
ECONOMY SLOWING
The soft housing data added to weak December construction spending, retail sales, factory orders, exports and business spending plans on equipment in setting the economy on a slower growth path in the first quarter. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting GDP rising at a 0.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
U.S. stocks were trading largely flat as investors waited for developments on U.S.-China trade talks. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
Despite the anticipated sharp first-quarter slowdown, the economy's fundamentals remain favorable. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index increased 3.0 points to a reading of 59.7 last month. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. January's drop in the services sector index was largely blamed on financial market volatility and the government shutdown.
The surge in services sector activity last month was in sharp contrast with an ISM survey last week showing its measure of national factory activity tumbled in February to its lowest reading since November 2016. That left some economists skeptical of February's rebound in services industry growth.
""But one month does not make a trend and we need to see more to say that things are turning around, ideally from the consumer,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The ISM's new orders sub-index for the services sector surged 7.5 points to a reading of 65.2 last month, the highest level since August 2005. The ISM said industries ""are concerned about the uncertainty of tariffs, capacity constraints and employment resources, however, they remain mostly optimistic about overall business conditions and the economy.""
Worries about import duties were mostly prevalent in the retail, support services, accommodation and food industries.
The ISM's services industry employment measure fell 2.6 points to 55.2 in February, the weakest reading since June 2018. The slowdown in hiring is likely related to worker shortages.

""While employment growth is cooling, it remains solid overall,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We expect the maturing labor market to add fewer jobs this year.""

8,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Mexico consumer confidence reaches record peak in February,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican consumer confidence rose in February for a third consecutive month, hitting its highest level on record, data from the national statistics agency showed on Tuesday.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, Mexico's consumer confidence index rose to 119.9 in February from 113.2 in January, continuing the upward trajectory it has taken since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December.
The data offers some respite for the leftist Lopez Obrador after a spate of recent warnings from analysts and economists over the outlook for Latin America's no. 2 economy.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to tackle poverty, reduce inequality and improve wages for the bulk of Mexican society.
His election in July also triggered a significant jump in the consumer confidence index.
In December, the country's wage commission agreed to raise the daily minimum wage of just over $4 by 16 percent, the biggest percentage raise since 1996.
Still, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos noted the bright optimism among consumers was not shared by companies.
""Business sentiment has been more subdued as producers have been apprehensive with regards to policy direction and overall sector-level policies,"" Ramos said in a note to clients.
Responding to warnings by ratings agencies that Mexico was running the risk of a downgrade to its credit rating, Lopez Obrador on Tuesday said the agencies were punishing the country for the ""neo-liberal"" policies of previous administrations, a favorite rhetorical target of the president.
The previous peak for the adjusted consumer confidence index was 116.1 in August 2001, a few months after data for the index began being registered by the statistics agency.
World Bank data shows that Mexico suffered a mild recession that year after the end of the dot-com boom.

The non-adjusted confidence index rose in February by nearly five points from the previous month to 116.8. That took the unadjusted index to its highest level since August 2001.

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 59.7 from 56.7 in January.
“The non-manufacturing sector’s growth rate rebounded in February after cooling off in January,” ISM chair Anthony Nieves explained in the report. “Respondents are concerned about the uncertainty of tariffs, capacity constraints and employment resources; however, they remain mostly optimistic about overall business conditions and the economy.”
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector released on Friday showed that U.S. factory activity fell to a two-year low as demand softened.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector and a reading below signals contraction.
Among the sub-indices, the non-manufacturing business activity index increased to 64.7 last month from 59.7 in January.
The new orders index, the most forward-looking element of the survey, ticked up to 65.2 from 57.7 the previous month.
The employment index fell to 55.2 from 57.8 previously, while the prices index fell to 54.4 from 59.4."""
11,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 06:24AM ET</span>",Euro zone business growth sped up but stayed weak in February,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity accelerated more than thought last month but remained lackluster as a pickup in services growth only partially masked a downturn in the bloc's manufacturing industry, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The results come two days before officials at the European Central Bank announce their latest monetary policy.
Having drawn a line under their more than 2.6 trillion euro stimulus program at the turn of the year, they are not expected to change policy on Thursday but will soon relaunch their long-term loan offerings, a Reuters poll suggested last week. 
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, rose to 51.9 in February from January's 51.0.
That was higher than an earlier flash reading of 51.4 but was close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The PMIs were slightly revised up, so that is a little bit of good news, but they are still at a level consistent with GDP growth of about 0.2 percent, so no improvement from the second half of last year,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.
Last week's Reuters poll predicted euro zone growth of 0.3 percent this quarter, faster than the 0.2 percent at the end of 2018.
Among the most important economies, France's service sector activity picked up in February, Italy's expanded slightly after contracting in January, and Spain's eased a bit but less than expected.
Higher demand propelled activity in Germany's services sector to a five-month peak in February, a further sign this branch of the economy will continue to provide growth momentum as manufacturing shrinks.
Euro zone manufacturing activity went into reverse for the first time in over five years last month, a sister survey showed on Friday, but a PMI covering the bloc's dominant services industry bounced to 52.8 from January's 51.2. 
Although that beat an earlier flash estimate of 52.3, January's reading matched December's four-year low and so came from a low base.
""There is this divergence between the services and manufacturing sectors which may suggest domestic demand is holding up better than external demand,"" Kenningham said.
""But if you look at what happened previously, any divergence between the two tends to be short-lived so I think the services sector may not hold up that well in the coming months.""
A new business index rose to a still-weak 51.4 from January's more than four-year low of 50.1.

Suggesting they were operating with some spare capacity, firms did not build up a backlog of work last month. The composite sub-index was bang on the break even 50 mark, an improvement from January's 48.3.

The current retirement age is 62, while companies are required by law to offer eligible employees the option of continuing to work until they are 67 - the so-called re-employment age.
Singapore's population is the second-fastest ageing after South Korea, according to U.N. figures, and the global financial hub is growing more dependent on its older residents as birth rates fall and foreign labor is restricted.
Manpower Minister Josephine Teo told parliament that a group consisting of government, trade unions and employers set up to look at the issue last year had reached consensus on the need to raise both thresholds, a spokesman for the ministry confirmed. 

The group will now work to establish how far and how fast these thresholds are raised over the next few months, Teo added.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.3 percent month-on-month in January after a 1.4 percent drop in December.
They were 2.2 percent higher than in January 2018, accelerating from a 0.3 percent year-on-year rise in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.2 percent monthly increase and a 1.9 percent annual gain. 

Retail sales are an indication of domestic demand, but they are often revised -- the data for December was revised from he originally reported 1.6 percent monthly fall and a 0.8 percent year-on-year increase.

14,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 04:59AM ET</span>","Brexit Concerns Stifle U.K. Economy, Service Sector Optimism Hits Historic Low","Investing.com - Heightened uncertainty over Britain’s impending departure from the European Union kept the British economy close to stagnation, despite a slight uptick in services sector business activity, according to a report released on Tuesday.
Brexit concerns led employment in the service sector to fall at the fastest pace in seven years, IHS Markit said. Business confidence slumped to historically low levels, while new work levels also dropped slightly.
“The latest PMI surveys indicate that the U.K. economy remained close to stagnation in February, despite a flurry of activity in many sectors ahead of the U.K.’s scheduled departure from the EU,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
Williamson indicated that the three surveys -covering the services, manufacturing and construction sectors - suggest growth of 0.1% for the British economy in the first quarter.
Research firm IHS Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 51.3 in February, but “Brexit concerns dominate the list of reasons cited by companies for deteriorating business performance by a wide margin.”
Even though the U.K. manufacturing sector has been supported by stockpiling in anticipation of a disorderly Brexit, activity hit a four-month low in February.
The reluctance to begin major new projects has also weighed heavily on the U.K.’s construction sector, where activity fell for the first time in 11 months.
Uncertainty over Brexit has risen to new peaks in recent weeks as various factions of lawmakers dig in to pursue their own desired outcome as the clock runs down to a March 29 deadline. Prime Minister Theresa May had said she’ll let that date be pushed back, if necessary, to find an outcome that can command a majority in parliament. However, European leaders have expressed reluctance at extending the deadline, unless the U.K. is prepared to shift its position materially.
“Business optimism about the year ahead has consequently sunk to the lowest ever recorded by the survey with the exceptions of the height of the global financial crisis and July 2016,” Williamson said."
15,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",UK economy flat-lines ahead of Brexit: PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy came close to stagnating again in February against a backdrop of Brexit nerves and sluggish global growth, and firms in the giant services sector cut staffing at the fastest rate in more than seven years, a survey showed.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index suggested the world's fifth-biggest economy would grow by just 0.1 percent in the first three months of 2019 compared with the last three of 2018.
After touching its lowest level in January since immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016, the services PMI edged up to 51.3 from 50.1. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a weaker reading of 49.9 in February. 
""Worse may be to come when pre-Brexit preparatory activities move into reverse,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
""Many Brexit-related headwinds and uncertainties also look set to linger in coming months even in the case of Prime Minister Theresa May's deal going through.""
Separate data on Tuesday showed consumers reined in their spending in February and shoppers focused on buying food, including for stockpiling, rather than non-essential items.
Britain's economy defied forecasts of a recession after the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union. 
But growth slowed sharply in late 2018 as worries mounted about the possibility of an abrupt, no-deal Brexit on March 29, and the global economy also weakened.
Under pressure from within her Conservative Party, Prime Minister Theresa May is still seeking to rework the Brexit deal she agreed with other EU leaders. She has raised the possibility of a delay of the departure date until June.
IHS Markit said optimism about the year ahead among services firms -- ranging from giant banks to high-street hairdressers -- had been lower only at the height of the global financial crisis and immediately after the Brexit referendum.
Many investment decisions were on hold and some firms said European clients were delaying committing to new projects in Britain. New export orders among services firms contracted for the sixth month in a row.
Companies cut jobs at the fastest pace since November 2011, with many opting not to replace people who left voluntarily.
Some firms said Britain's low unemployment rate was making it hard to find skilled staff.

IHS Markit said the main positive in February was the weakest increase in costs for services firms since May last year, opening up scope for offering discounts to clients.

Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.3 from 53.0 in January. The figure was higher than a flash estimate of 55.1.
By contrast, activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the second time in a row, falling to a 74-month low, a sister survey by Markit released last week showed.
This resulted in the composite index rising to a four-month high of 52.8, which Markit economist Phil Smith said pointed to the economy returning to growth in the first quarter after stagnating in the final three months of 2018.
""However, with manufacturing output slipping into decline and exports on a downward trend, the overall picture from the surveys remains one of only modest underlying growth,"" Smith said.
Germany is facing headwinds from trade frictions between the United States and both China and the European Union, weaker demand from the euro zone, and risks linked to the possibility Britain will leave the EU this month without a deal.
The economic slowdown is being particularly felt by its export-dependent manufacturers.
""In stark contrast to the broad-based deterioration in the manufacturing PMI indicators, all measures of performance for the services economy improved,"" Smith said.
The survey showed that new business grew at a faster pace than in January. In addition, employers in the services sector created jobs at the strongest rate since October and business confidence in the sector reached the highest level since April 2018.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the French services industry rose to 50.2 points from 47.8 in January.
IHS Markit's overall composite PMI index, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, also advanced to 50.4 points from 48.2 in January.
Turnout for the 16th round of ""yellow vests"" ('gilets jaunes') protests in France last weekend was below the previous week's levels and marches were largely peaceful, a relief for President Emmanuel Macron who has struggled to find a response to the movement.
""With the worst of the 'gilets jaunes' protests having passed, the composite rebound was aided by signs of a fractional recovery in the service sector. Service providers consequently increased staff numbers at a quicker rate than in January,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
""However, despite the return to expansion, it is clear that France still has a way to go before reaching its growth potential. Volumes of new business continued to decline, which indicates that demand is yet to fully recover,"" added Kerr.

But a batch of weak recent data such as exports and factory output has raised concerns that weakening global demand and the Sino-U.S. trade war could hamper any further improvement in 2019.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to have grown an annualized 1.8 percent in the October-December quarter, the poll of 17 economists showed, up from the preliminary reading of 1.4 percent.
That would translate into a 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter expansion after the initial estimate of 0.3 percent, the poll found.
""We forecast capital spending and inventory investment to have been revised up from the initial reading,"" said Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. ""But the economy only made up for its losses in July-September and there is no change to our view that the economy lacks momentum."" 
Capital spending was expected to have risen 2.8 percent for the quarter, upgraded from the initial reading of 2.4 percent, the poll found.
The economy rebounded in the fourth quarter after it contracted in July-September as natural disasters such as typhoons and a big earthquake temporarily disrupted production. 
But the pace of recovery remains tepid and is unable to reduce concerns about the impacts on economic growth from global trade tensions and a planned sales tax hike in October. 
The Cabinet Office will release the GDP data on March 8 at 8:50 a.m. Japan time (2350 GMT, March 7).

20,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>",Australia central bank on hold as economy slows to a crawl,"By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank stuck to its upbeat view of the economy after it held rates at record lows in a widely expected move on Tuesday, just a day before GDP data is likely to show domestic momentum almost stalled last quarter. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended a 30th straight meeting with rates at 1.50 percent and signaled a steady policy outlook as it awaits a pick up in economic growth and inflation.
That wait may prove longer with a run of soft data from consumption to housing this week leading analysts to downgrade forecasts for fourth-quarter growth to near nothing. Official figures on gross domestic product (GDP) are due on Wednesday.
A weak number could jeopardize re-election prospects for Australia's centre-right government which has been pitching ""jobs and growth"" as its key economic mantra. 
The Liberal-National government faces a tough election in May and is widely expected to entice voters with tax cuts and more spending in its annual budget on April 2.
Analysts polled by Reuters suspect the economy expanded by a sub-par 0.3 percent in the December quarter, after a disappointing 0.3 percent rise in the third quarter.
Annual growth is seen slowing to 2.5 percent, from 2.8 percent, making the RBA's call for 3 percent this year look increasingly optimistic.
A flat print could lead the RBA to shift to a dovish stance from its current neutral bias, Citi economist Josh Williamson said in a note. The central bank last month abandoned its long-held tightening bias. 
RBA Governor Philip Lowe acknowledged Australia's A$1.8 trillion economy may have slowed over the second half of 2018. Still, he held out the hope for growth to pick up to around 3 percent this year led by rising business investment, higher government spending and stimulatory monetary policy.
Another reason for the RBA's confidence in the economic outlook is a robust employment sector.
""The stronger labor market has led to some pick-up in wages growth, which is a welcome development,"" Lowe said in a brief statement accompanying the bank's rate decision. 
""The improvement in the labor market should see some further lift in wages growth over time, although this is still expected to be a gradual process.""
Lowe again pointed to household consumption as ""the main domestic uncertainty"" especially given anemic wages growth and sliding housing prices in the nation's biggest cities of Sydney and Melbourne. 
So far, Lowe has played down the damage done by the fall in home values, noting that it comes after a decade of booming prices. The housing market will be the topic of his speech on Wednesday.
A CUT? 
The RBA's overall optimism isn't shared by many economists who expect a slowdown in domestic activity this year would push the central bank to further ease policy. 
Interest rate futures are pointing to an 86 percent probability of a cut to 1.25 percent by the end of this year.
Lowe has conceded that an easing in the 1.5 percent cash rate might be contemplated if the labor market takes a turn for the worse and unemployment starts to rise from the current 5.0 percent. 
""We think rate cuts this year, while not guaranteed, are now more likely than not,"" said Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst.
""At heart is a weaker regional and global growth environment, which comes at a poor time for Australia, given the local dynamics of a 'stretched' consumer.""
He is tipping a cut in both July and August, taking rates to a new all time low of 1 percent.
Data out earlier showed net exports trimmed 0.2 percentage points from GDP, double that expected by analysts. 
A saving grace came from government spending which added a bit more than 0.3 percentage points to GDP in the quarter.
Public spending accounts for almost 24 percent of Australia's annual GDP and a much-needed binge on infrastructure is proving a crucial supporter of growth across the economy.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 11:59PM ET</span>",China services growth eases to four-month low in further blow to economy: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector expanded at the slowest pace in four months in February, pressured by fewer new orders at home and abroad, a private survey showed on Tuesday, underlining growing strains on the economy and a challenging outlook for businesses this year. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.1, the lowest since October and down sharply from January's 53.6. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
The findings were largely in line with those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector released last week, which showed services activity cooled in February after rebounding for two straight months.
China is banking on a stronger services sector to cushion a slowdown in its vast manufacturing industry that is being hit by rising labor costs and a U.S.-China trade war. However, consumers have turned more cautious about spending as income growth slowed in the face of a broadening economic slowdown. 
Growth in new orders fell to the weakest since October, while export sales also rose at the slowest clip in five months, pointing to softer demand both at home and overseas. 
Job creation in the services sector also eased off to grow at only a marginal pace, which is sure to keep policymakers wary as Beijing will be keen to avoid significant job losses lest it stokes social instability. 
With the manufacturing sector still in contraction, and new export orders falling last month, business sentiment has taken a hit in sign of heightened concerns about the outlook.
Indeed, confidence for the year ahead among Chinese services providers fell to a three-month low, while operating expenses in February rose faster than the previous month. 
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Tuesday, slipped to 50.7 in February from 50.9 in January. 
""In general, domestic manufacturing demand recovered significantly in February,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group.
""However, with downward pressure on employment, expansion in the services industry slowed notably. Increased infrastructure investment may have prevented a sharper decline in economic growth.""

Chinese policymakers have rolled out a flurry of measures to support the world's second-largest economy which is growing at its slowest pace in almost three decades. More policy steps are expected in coming months, though some relief might be in the offing for businesses as signs emerge that Beijing and Washington might strike a deal to end their bitter year-long trade war.

The lower end of the growth target would represent the slowest pace of economic growth in nearly three decades, according to Bloomberg. Unlike other years, authorities in Beijing are giving themselves a band for the growth target, as opposed to a specific number, which could give them more flexibility.
Chinese authorities also announced tax breaks on Tuesday morning, most notably a 3% cut to the top bracket of the value-added tax (VAT) in order to support the manufacturing sector.
According to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) the 3 percentage-point cut to VAT could translate into CNY600 billion ($90 billion) or 0.6% of GDP, Bloomberg reported.
Other target economic figures for 2019 announced by Beijing include consumer price index (CPI) growth of 3% and a budget deficit of 2.8% of GDP."
23,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 07:40PM ET</span>",Japan February services PMI shows new business grows at fastest pace in almost six years,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese services sector activity expanded in February as new business grew at the fastest pace in almost six years, a business survey showed on Tuesday, a sign that domestic demand remains in good health in early 2019.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.3 in February from 51.6 in January.
The index stayed above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 29th month.
""Japan's service sector remained resilient in February, contrasting to the struggles the country's manufacturers have endured so far this quarter,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Service providers will play an important role in the coming months if Japan's economy is to avoid slipping into a downturn.""
The index measuring new business increased to 54.5 from 52.1 in January, reaching its highest since May 2013 due to stronger sales, new product launches and an increase in demand from overseas, the survey showed.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, eased slightly to 50.7 in February from 50.9 in January, because factory activity last month contracted at the fastest pace in two-and-a-half years due to the U.S.-China trade war.
In the past eight months, the United States has imposed punitive tariffs on $250 billion worth of imports from China, while Beijing has hit back with tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods.
This has caused Japan's exports and factory output to fall because it ships a lot of electronic parts and heavy machinery to manufacturers in China.
The United States and China appear close to a deal that would roll back U.S. tariffs on at least $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, a source briefed on negotiations told Reuters.

If the United States and China can end their trade war, this would gradually lift the burden on Japan's manufacturing sector, economists say.

This matched the pace for first-quarter gross domestic product that the Atlanta Fed's GDP program calculated on Friday.
U.S. nonresidential structures investment is likely 2.7 percent lower in the first quarter from a prior estimate of a 0.8 percent drop, while residential investment is expected to fall 11.0 percent from a projected 13.2 percent decline calculated on Friday, the regional central bank said.
Earlier Monday, the Commerce Department said construction spending declined 0.6 percent after an unrevised 0.8 percent increase in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.2 percent in December.
Fourth-quarter GDP expanded at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter, bringing the annual growth rate to 2.9 percent in 2018.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in December as investment in both private and public projects dropped, leading economists to expect that the government will trim its economic growth estimate for the fourth quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Monday was further evidence the economy lost momentum at the tail end of 2018. Growth is slowing as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending ebbs. Trade tensions between the United States and China as well as slowing global economies are also hurting domestic activity.
The construction spending report extended the run of weak December economic data, that has included retail sales, housing starts, trade and home sales.
""The report is in line with the U.S. economy losing some steam at the end of the year,"" said Steven Shields, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Construction spending declined 0.6 percent after an unrevised 0.8 percent increase in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.2 percent in December. Construction spending increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis. 
It rose 4.1 percent in 2018, the weakest reading since 2011. The release of the December report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the government that ended on Jan. 25.
Based on the construction spending data, economists expect the government will pare its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by at least one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate. 
The government reported last Thursday that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the October-December period, slowing from the third quarter's brisk 3.4 percent pace. 
It is scheduled to publish revisions to the fourth-quarter GDP data at the end of the month. The stream of soft December reports set the economy on a slower growth path in the first quarter.
""We continue to see downside risk to our 1.5 percent growth forecast for the first quarter with much of the related monthly source data now reported through December,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
In December, spending on private construction projects fell 0.6 percent after surging 1.3 percent in November. Investment in private residential projects tumbled 1.4 percent after rebounding 3.4 percent in November. 
The housing market has been weighed down by higher mortgage rates, expensive building materials as well as land and labor shortages. Residential investment contracted 0.2 percent in 2018, the worst performance since 2010.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, gained 0.4 percent in December after declining 1.1 percent in November. Spending on nonresidential structures contracted in both the third and fourth quarters.
Investment in public construction projects fell 0.6 percent in December to an eight-month low after decreasing 1.0 percent in November. Spending on federal government construction projects plunged 2.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in November.

Investment in state and local government construction projects fell 0.5 percent in December to an eight-month low after dropping 1.1 percent in November.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.4 percent month-on-month for a 3.0 percent year-on-year increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent monthly rise and a 2.9 percent annual gain.
Eurostat said energy prices rebounded in January, rising 0.4 percent on the month, after a 2.7 percent fall in December. Intermediate goods prices rose 0.3 percent after a 0.4 percent decline in December and capital goods prices rose 0.6 percent after no change in December.
Producer prices are an early indication of trends in consumer prices, because unless their changes are absorbed by intermediaries and retailers, they are passed on to consumers.
The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation below but close to 2 percent over the medium term. Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent year-on-year in February accelerating from 1.4 percent in January because of the still high contribution of energy. 

Without the volatile energy component, consumer prices rose 1.2 percent year-on-year in February -- the same as producer prices excluding energy in January.

Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.5 in February, its lowest level since March 2018.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
“The U.K. construction sector moved into decline during February as Brexit anxiety intensified and clients opted to delay decision-making on building projects,” Tim Moore, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.
“The recent fears over the Brexit-related impacts on the sector were realized this month, as barring the weather related blip in March last year, construction put in its worst performance since September 2017, with the PMI contracting to just below the no-change mark,” Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply that participates in the survey, said.
“In short, the foundations of the construction sector are crumbling under the weight of Brexit and businesses are switching to survival mode until the way forward is cleared,"" he added.
Construction activity in both commercial and civil engineering projects contracted the report said, while housebuilding saw only a modest increase in activity. With new orders falling, construction companies were also wary of hiring new workers."
30,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 10:25PM ET</span>",Australia economy hits dry spell as incomes fail to flow,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian businesses reported only meager growth in profits and wages for the fourth quarter of last year, a dry spell for incomes that likely saw the whole economy struggle to expand.
A range of data out on Monday also showed home building was heading for a deep hole after years of outperformance, while job ads suffered their biggest annual drop in five years.
The signs were of an economy that has clearly lost traction in recent months and may have grown only marginally in the December quarter, figures for which are due Wednesday.
Analysts suspect gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a pedestrian 0.4 percent in the December quarter, with weakness in wages and house prices curbing consumption.
Annual growth is seen slowing to around 2.6 percent, from 2.8 percent, challenging the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) optimism for a pick up to 3 percent this year.
The central bank, which holds its March policy meeting on Tuesday, recently warned that a further significant fall in home prices could undermine household wealth and spending, and perhaps warrant a cut in interest rates. 
Falling prices combined with tighter bank lending have also sent a chill across the construction industry with approvals to build new homes down 29 percent in February from a year earlier.
While Monday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed approvals bounced 2.5 percent from January, that followed two months of very sharp falls.
""The update pares back some of the concerning weakness that was emerging through the back end of 2018, particularly around non high-rise activity,"" said Westpac economist Matthew Hassan.
""However, the through the year numbers are clearly still very weak and dwelling construction will continue to detract materially from growth in 2019.""
PROFITS TOUGH TO COME BY 
With consumers cautious, companies were finding it harder to make money. Gross operating profits undershot forecasts with a rise of just 0.8 percent in the December quarter, and that despite a windfall for miners from high commodity prices.
Neither were firms keen to splash out. The wages bill for business rose 0.8 percent in the quarter, only a fraction ahead of employment growth. That implied firms were taking on new workers rather than paying current staff much more.
The resilience of the labor market has been a rare source of comfort for policy makers. RBA Governor Philip Lowe has said rates would only be cut if there was a significant and sustained rise in the unemployment rate, currently at 5.0 percent.
So the latest survey on jobs ads could be a worry.
Figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) showed total job advertisements fell 0.9 percent in February, from January when they slipped 1.7 percent.
That was the fourth straight month of losses and left ads down 4.3 percent on a year earlier.
""The labor market has been a key source of strength for the Australian economy over the past year, with the strong gain in jobs and declining unemployment rate providing a material offset to the impact of lower house prices,"" said ANZ's head of Australian economics, David Plank. 

""The year ahead looks to be more challenging.""

31,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>",Japan Price Barometer Points to Deflation Risk This Summer,"(Bloomberg) -- The inflation outlook is looking dismal for the Bank of Japan as cheaper oil and falling mobile phone charges threaten to push price growth toward zero by mid-summer.
The Bloomberg Inflation Barometer, which draws on eight drivers of prices, points to a sharp slowing in the months ahead as lower oil costs feed their way into electricity bills. Over the past eight years the barometer has shown a 0.84 correlation with consumer prices six months into the future.
Mobile phone carriers could complicate the BOJ’s quest to revive inflation as they come under political pressure to lower charges further. And making matters worse, free education measures planned by the government are already projected by the BOJ to shave another 0.3 percentage point from inflation later in the year.
Flat-lining of prices would heap pressure on the central bank to take action or justify its decision not to. Any softening in the yen, further wage gains or jump in oil prices could still help the BOJ stick to its view that temporary factors don’t warrant an immediate response.
The BOJ is trying to generate 2 percent inflation and has pledged to continue its stimulus program until its goal is achieved.
The central bank has already slashed its inflation forecasts for the fiscal year starting in April to 0.9 percent from 1.4 percent. But even this forecast looks overly optimistic.
While Japan’s three biggest mobile phone carriers say they have already lowered prices by at least 30 percent in the last year, the government has called for reductions of 40 percent, an outcome that could shave 0.9 percentage point off overall price growth.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 01:24PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending, factory data point to weak first quarter GDP growth","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. personal income fell for the first time in more than three years in January and consumer spending dropped by the most since 2009 in December, putting the economy on a weak growth path early in the first quarter.
The economic outlook was also darkened by other data on Friday showing factory activity hit a more than two-year low in February, with manufacturers reporting slowing new orders and hiring. The reports extended the run of soft data on an economy that lost momentum at the tail end of 2018 and gave more credence to the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" stance towards raising interest rates further this year. 
The economy is losing speed as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending fades. A trade war between the United States and China, higher interest rates, softening global growth and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union are clouding the outlook. 
""A modest slowdown remains the most likely path for 2019,"" said Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein in New York. ""We shouldn't expect any action from the Fed into at least the second half of the year.""
The Commerce Department said personal income slipped 0.1 percent in January, the first decline since November 2015, after jumping 1.0 percent in December. Income was weighed down by decreases in dividend, farm proprietors' and interest income.
Income was boosted in December by a one-time special dividend by information technology firm VMware Inc as well as government payments to farmers caught up in the U.S.-China trade war.
Wages increased by a moderate 0.3 percent in January after rising 0.5 percent in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast incomes rising 0.3 percent in January. 
The Commerce Department did not publish the January consumer spending portion of the report as the collection and processing of retail sales data was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the government that ended on Jan. 25. 
It reported that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 0.5 percent in December. That was the biggest decline since September 2009 and followed a 0.6 percent increase in November. 
Households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and recreational goods in December, leading to a 1.9 percent plunge in spending on goods. Spending on goods increased 1.0 percent in November. Outlays on services edged up 0.1 percent, held back by a decline in spending on household electricity and gas. Spending on services advanced 0.4 percent in November. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.6 percent in December, also the largest drop since September 2009, after rising 0.5 percent in November.
The December data was included in the fourth-quarter gross domestic product report published on Thursday, which showed consumer spending growing at a 2.8 percent annualized rate during that period, slower than the third quarter's robust 3.5 percent pace.
The economy grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the October-December quarter after notching a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG SAVINGS
The sharp deceleration in consumer spending in December puts consumption on a lower growth trajectory in the first quarter and bolsters analysts' expectations that the economy will slow down further in the first three months of the year.
""Unless there is a big upward revision to the disastrous December retail sales figure, the weak end-of-quarter consumption profile provides for very challenging arithmetic for first-quarter consumption growth,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Still, consumer spending likely remains supported by a strong accumulation of savings, which surged to a six-year high of $1.2 trillion in December from $961.3 billion in November. The saving rate jumped to a three-year high of 7.6 percent. In addition, consumer sentiment remains high.
With spending tanking, inflation remained tame in December. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in November. 
That left the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 1.9 percent. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.
It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012. 
Inflation is likely to remain benign despite a tight labor market as supply constraints at factories ease. A third report on Friday showed the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) national factory activity index fell 2.4 points to 54.2 last month, the lowest reading since November 2016. 
A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Raw material prices fell for a second straight month in February after nearly three years of increases.
Manufacturers offered mixed views of business conditions. Machinery manufacturers said orders remained strong, but makers of fabricated metal products expressed concern ""about indicators showing a slight recession for the second half of the calendar year."" 
Plastics and rubber products manufacturers said ""general business conditions started to slow at the end of January, continuing through February.""

""This supports our move to lower our first-quarter GDP forecast,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""We need to see a turnaround in coming months.""

Canada’s gross domestic product, or the broadest measure of goods and services produced in an economy, rose only 0.1% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, Statistics Canada said, reflecting a weakening housing market, softer oil prices and the effect of both on consumer confidence.
The agency said investment fell 2.7% in the quarter, while housing investment in particular fell 3.9% and new construction fell 5.5%. Household spending also slowed for the second-straight quarter. Falling oil prices also meant that exports fell 0.1% in the quarter.
The result was marginally ahead of economists’ expectations for a flat reading, but the loonie still fell against the dollar on the news. By 09:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the greenback stood at $1.3360, up a cent from before the data.
""Put simply, it is never a good sign when an inventory build and import contraction are the factors keeping growth above water,"" Toronto Dominion Bank Brian DePratto said via 


In year-on-year terms, fourth-quarter output was up 1.7% from a year earlier. That's unchanged from the third quarter and an improvement on forecasts for only 1.4% growth. Over the whole of 2018, Canada's economy grew only 1.8%, down from 3% in 2017. That's despite the marked pickup in growth in the U.S., its biggest trading partner.
The data challenge the Bank of Canada's intention to raise interest rates later this year, adding to the evidence of a broad weakening of activity in recent months. Annual inflation, at 1.4% in January, is still well below the bank's official target.
Still, it is uncertain when the bank will raise the benchmark rate, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said last week.
The bank is due to announce its next interest rate decisions on March 6. Poloz had warned last week in particular about the housing market, business investment levels and global trade uncertainty.
""Given these uncertainties, we have kept interest rates unchanged at 1.75% since last October,"" Poloz said. ""We will remain decidedly data-dependent as the domestic and international situations evolve."""
36,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 08:51AM ET</span>","UK factories brace for Brexit, but consumers less worried","By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British factories are cutting jobs and bracing for Brexit by stockpiling goods at a record pace, but consumers seem less worried, suggesting their spending might help to shore up the economy, data showed on Friday.
A measure of manufacturing - the IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index - hit a four-month low in February, and the fall would have been worse if factories had not rushed to build up inventories to see them through any Brexit border chaos.
A measure of stockpiling hit a record high for any Group of Seven economy while factories cut jobs at the fastest pace in six years and were increasingly downbeat about the future.
But separate data showed households took out more mortgages and increased borrowing in January by more than any forecast for both indicators in a Reuters poll of economists.
James Smith, an economist with ING, said consumers were likely to focus on Brexit closer to the event.
""People are still nervous, and that could increase over the next few weeks as we get closer to the crunch,"" he said.
The world's fifth-biggest economy has slowed ahead of Brexit, which is scheduled for March 29, although Prime Minister Theresa May has paved the way for a possible delay.
A weakening of the world economy has also weighed on Britain, and an equivalent euro zone manufacturing index fell into contractionary territory on Friday. 
For consumers, at least for now, the worries about Brexit appear to have been offset by a fall in inflation and a gradual acceleration of growth in their pay, which has restored some of their spending power.
Even so, the pace of annual growth in consumer borrowing was the weakest in over four years.
For companies, the prospect of a delay to Brexit, possibly until June, might have eased the immediate fears of a chaotic exit from the EU, but it also threatens to extend the uncertainty.
Business investment in Britain fell in all four quarters of 2018, a run not seen since the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. 
""This additional delay means businesses will not have the certainty they need to resume spending for a while longer,"" Allan Monks, an economist with JP Morgan said.
""This in turn suggests growth will take longer to recover from the current soft patch, and highlights the risk that the Bank of England will tighten later than our August forecast.""
The BoE has said it plans to resume raising interest rates gradually, if Britain can avoid the shock of a no-deal Brexit.

Manufacturing represents about 10 percent of total British economic output. PMI data for the construction and dominant services sector are due on Monday and Tuesday.

The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 0.5% last month, its first decline since September 2016.
Economists had forecast a drop of 0.2%.
The data’s release was delayed due to the government shutdown and comes after data that had already shown the lowest level of retail sales in nine years.
Although the personal income data was for January, the first readings of the year for personal spending and the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) remained delayed, with Friday's readings corresponding to the month of December.
The report also showed that personal income dropped 0.1% in January, its first decline in nearly three years. That came after a 1% rise in December that the Commerce Department attributed to an increase in special payments, including a special dividend from VMWare and subsidies to farmers.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 1.9% in December from a year earlier, in line with expectations. The Fed generally shoots for inflation close to 2%."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Factories across the globe slammed on the brakes last month as demand crashed, hit by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, slowing global growth and political uncertainty in Europe ahead of Britain's imminent departure from the EU.
A slew of surveys on Friday highlighted how much manufacturers are suffering, particularly those exposed to China's slowdown, and adds weight to expectations that policy tightening from central banks is pretty much over.
Euro zone manufacturing activity went into reverse for the first time in over five years last month, British factories slashed jobs and braced for Brexit while China's vast manufacturing industry contracted for a third straight month.
Japan's factory gauge fell at the sharpest pace in 2-1/2 years as slumping orders prompted plants to cut production, while data from South Korea showed its exports plummeted.
""All in all it does suggest there is a lot of weakness out there. What's driving it is those countries which are particularly exposed to China and they have taken a hit,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""Overall it doesn't appear to have been a particularly strong start to the year.""
IHS Markit's February euro zone final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a seventh month, coming in at 49.3, its first time below the 50 level separating growth from contraction since June 2013.
Giving little hope for a turnaround in the bloc's fortune anytime soon, new orders fell at the fastest rate in almost six years, backlogs of work were run down, purchases of raw materials were curtailed and hiring remained weak.
Faced with a further slowdown in euro zone growth, the ECB will re-launch cheap bank loans as early as June and delay rate hikes to 2020 in a bid to stave off a recession, a Reuters poll predicted on Friday. [ECILT/EU]
In Britain, which is due to leave the European Union in less than a month, factories stockpiled goods at the fastest pace seen in any Group of Seven country since records started in the early 1990s in case the country fails to get a transition deal to smooth the shock of Brexit.
""The current index reading – 52.0 – does mean the sector is still narrowly expanding, but make no mistake, the underlying details make it clear that this is only because firms are building up inventory ahead of Brexit,"" said James Smith at ING.
CHINA CRACKS SPREADING
In China, both private and official factory gauges showed activity levels remained mired near three-year lows, with a government reading on Thursday pointing to the weakest export orders since the global financial crisis.
Factories also continued to shed jobs, a trend Beijing is closely watching as it weighs more support measures.
While there was a marginal pick-up in domestic orders in China, analysts said it was too early to tell if it was due to growth-boosting measures announced by Beijing in recent months or seasonal distortions linked to the long Lunar New Year holidays early in the year.
""The upshot is that it is probably too soon to call the bottom of (China's) current economic cycle,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note after the survey. ""Indeed, we expect growth to continue to come under pressure until the middle of this year.""
China watchers are looking to Premier Li Keqiang's work report to the annual meeting of parliament next week for clues on further stimulus plans. Li will set out the government's economic targets for the year on Tuesday. 
Sources have told Reuters Beijing will set a 2019 growth target of 6.0-6.5 percent, down from around 6.5 percent in 2018. China reported economic growth cooled to 6.6 percent last year, its weakest pace since 1990, but some analysts believe actual activity is much weaker.
In Japan, the Markit/Nikkei Manufacturing PMI fell into contraction territory as both domestic and foreign orders slumped.
""We need to be mindful that uncertainty over the global economic outlook is heightening,"" Bank of Japan board member Hitoshi Suzuki said on Thursday, after data showed the biggest drop in industrial output in a year in January.
Readings from South Korea -- the first economy in Asia to report trade data each month - were equally grim. Its exports contracted 11.1 percent in February from a year earlier, their biggest drop in nearly three years, with shipments to major buyer China slumping 17.4 percent.
India bucked the trend, with activity expanding at the fastest pace in over a year. The findings came a day after data showed Asia's third-largest economy grew much less than expected in the final quarter of 2018.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 05:28AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation's rise is a mixed bag for ECB,"By Philip Blenkinsop and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation inched up last month, Eurostat said on Friday, mild comfort for the European Central Bank as it prepares fresh measures to mitigate an unexpectedly deep and long economic slowdown. 
Consumer inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro picked up to 1.5 percent in February, as expected, from 1.4 percent in January, as food and energy costs continued to rise.
But underlying inflation, closely watched by the ECB, failed to rise. Price growth excluding food and energy held steady at 1.2 percent, short of the central bank's overall inflation target of almost 2 percent.
This may be especially concerning for the ECB, because it has long predicted a pick-up in core inflation. The weak readings suggest a poor understanding of how inflation dynamics changed after the euro zone's debt crisis. 
They also give the ECB yet another reason to delay removing any further stimulus, especially since the bloc's growth weakness points to a dire need of more support, not less.
Indeed, the ECB, which just ended a 2.6 trillion-euro bond-buying scheme aimed at pushing down borrowing costs, is already contemplating new support measures, with the first possibly coming at its next policy meeting, on March 7. 
Wanting to combat a slowdown in bank lending, the ECB is likely to signal more long-term loans to banks, in the hope of maintaining the flow of credit and investments. 
While the bank continues to signal for steady rates only through the summer, few believe rates will rise this year. Markets have already moved their expectations for an increase to mid-2020. 
In a separate release, Eurostat reported the euro zone's unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in January, unchanged from a revised figure a month earlier, although 23,000 fewer people were unemployed than in December.
The 7.8 percent reading was the lowest since October 2008. December's number had previously been estimated at 7.9 percent.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>","UK borrowers, defying Brexit nerves, regain appetite for credit","LONDON (Reuters) - British households took out more mortgages and increased their borrowing in January, adding to signs that consumers are less worried about Brexit than many businesses, Bank of England data showed.
The number of mortgages approved for house purchase was higher than any forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, hitting 66,766 in January, a jump from 64,468 in December.
At the same time, consumer borrowing picked up by nearly 1.1 billion pounds, also beating all forecasts in the Reuters poll.
However, the annual growth rate in unsecured consumer lending slowed to 6.5 percent, its weakest pace in more than four years, the BoE figures showed.
Britain's economy has slowed sharply ahead of Brexit which is officially due to happen later this month, although Prime Minister Theresa May this week opened the way for the possibility of a delay.
The country's manufacturing sector slowed again in February, according to a survey also published on Friday.
But there have been signs that consumers began 2019 without showing much sign of nervousness.
Earlier this week, data from Britain's banking industry showed the highest number of mortgage approvals in January since September 2017 - hinting at a stabilization in the weak housing market - while its measure of consumer credit grew at its fastest pace in nearly a year.
A survey published on Thursday showed consumer confidence close to a five-year low but edging up in February.
Friday's BoE data showed net mortgage lending, which tends to lag behind approvals, slowing to 3.660 billion pounds in January, a sharper loss of growth momentum than economists expected.
But credit card lending bounced back to rise by 347 million pounds. 
The BoE also said net gilt holdings by foreign investors fell by 9.545 billion pounds in January, compared with an increase of 11.960 billion pounds in December.

Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell as expected to 52.0 in February, from 52.6 at the beginning of the year. That was a fourth-month low and its second-lowest level since July 2016 - the month following the U.K.’s vote to leave the EU.
Although stronger than French and German factory PMIs, IHS Markit said the increase in British factory output mostly reflected stockpiling and a drive to cut work backlogs in case the country fails to get a transition deal to smooth the shock of Brexit.
The PMI’s stocks of purchases index rose in February to 59.1, the highest level on record for any G7 PMI.
“With Brexit day looming, U.K. manufacturers continued to implement plans to mitigate potential disruptions,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
“The current elevated degree of uncertainty is also having knock-on effects for business confidence and employment, with optimism at its lowest ebb in the survey’s history and the rate of job losses accelerating to a six-year high,” Dobson added.
“Manufacturing and the broader U.K. economy therefore face a difficult 2019, with the slowdown being exacerbated later in the year as inventory positions are unwound and Brexit-related headwinds likely to linger,” he concluded."

IHS Markit's February final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a seventh month, coming in at 49.3 from January's 50.5, just above a flash reading but its first time below the 50 level separating growth from contraction since June 2013.
An index measuring output which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday - seen as a good gauge of economic health - fell to 49.4 from 50.5, its lowest since May 2013.
Earlier figures from Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed factory growth contracted for a second month. France's manufacturing PMI showed growth slowed sharply while Spain's went sub-50 for the first time in over five years.
""Euro area manufacturing is in its deepest downturn for almost six years, with forward-looking indicators suggesting risks are tilted further to the downside as we move into spring,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Giving little hope for a turnaround in the bloc's fortune anytime soon, new orders fell at the fastest rate in almost six years, backlogs of work were run down, purchases of raw materials were curtailed and hiring remained weak.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, optimism was at one of its lowest levels since IHS Markit began collecting the data in July 2012. The future output index fell to 56.7 from 57.4.
""In addition to widespread trade war worries, often linked to U.S. tariffs, and concerns regarding the outlook for the global economy, companies report that heightened political uncertainty, including Brexit, is hitting demand and driving increased risk aversion,"" Williamson said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index rose to 51.5 in February from 51.2 in January. That was marginally better than a preliminary reading of 51.4 and brought the index further from the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
Manufacturers saw output increase for the first time since September while new orders returned to growth for the first time since October.
The improvement in the order flow came entirely from demand at home as export orders weakened for the sixth consecutive month, IHS Markit.
""The results show that France's domestic performance provided resistance against weakening export markets,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""Such resilience was not seen in Germany, where the latest flash release showed a collapse in manufacturing export business, driving output into contraction territory,"" Kerr added.

The AIB manufacturing purchasing managers' index improved to 54.0 in February from 52.6 in January, which was the slowest growth since October 2016. The February reading was well ahead of the euro zone flash manufacturing PMI of 49.2.
Ireland has weathered the initial uncertainty from the 2016 Brexit vote, posting the fastest economic growth in Europe for five straight years. But its central bank has warned a 'no deal' Brexit could knock as much as 4 percentage points off the growth rate in its first full year.
Britain has yet to agree a withdrawal deal or request and extension to avoid crashing out of the bloc on March 29.
""The rise in the Irish index was driven by stronger growth in output and new orders, with firms reporting a pick-up in both domestic and international demand, most notably from the U.S. and UK,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said.
""The impact of Brexit was evident in many of the components of the PMI as some firms moved to take action to avoid possible disruption to supply chains,"" he said.
Stocks of purchases have risen in 11 of the past 12 months and pre-production inventories increased in February at their fastest pace in the 21-year history of the survey. Employment hit a four-month high, it said.
A number of panelists said they had brought forward purchases of inputs to secure raw materials in case of any stock problems resulting from Brexit, but others reported stronger customer demand, the authors said in a statement.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity contracted for a third straight month in February but at a slower pace, helped by improvements in domestic manufacturing, a private survey showed on Friday.
The readings - closely watched by investors as an alternative to the official data and more focused on smaller firms - offered further evidence China's economy is losing momentum and suggests the U.S.-Sino trade war will continue to weigh on exports as prospects for a trade deal remain uncertain.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for February rose to 49.9 from 48.3 in January - staying below the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis for a third month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a sharper deterioration for February of 48.5.
The figures were more upbeat than the official survey on Thursday - which showed business sentiment in the sector dropped to a three-year low and export orders fell to their lowest in a decade - indicating a marginal improvement in domestic demand as a flurry of policy stimulus kicked in from late last year.
""Domestic manufacturing demand improved significantly, and foreign demand was not deteriorating as quickly as last year,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a commentary accompanying the data release. 
Total new orders edged back to expansionary territory in February at 50.2, compared with January's 47.3 and ending two months' of contraction, with output prices growing for the first time in four months. 
Factory output also grew marginally after contracting the previous month.
The stronger-than-expected PMI data gave the Australian and New Zealand dollars a lift.
Zhong said the recovery was due to more robust domestic demand, thanks to the early issuance of local governments' special-purpose bonds, which were fast-tracked by Chinese authorities to spur infrastructure investment, more supportive monetary policy, and a price recovery for industrial goods.
But new export orders fell in February after a brief rebound in the previous month, and purchasing activity declined for the second straight month, likely due to still soft demand. 
Chinese manufacturers signaled a deterioration in vendor performance during February. Factories also continued to cut costs by shedding staff for the 64th straight month, at a sharper pace than the previous month. 
""The pressure on manufacturers' capital turnover became obvious again, which may reflect that the financing environment was not easing as expected, and the effect of credit expansion is not yet significant,"" Zhong added.
The degree of optimism among businesses also slipped from January's eight-month high. Companies surveyed remained concerned about the U.S.-China trade dispute, relatively subdued demand conditions and restrictive national policies, saying that could further weigh on production, the statement said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Thursday he could walk away from a trade deal with China if it were not good enough, even as his economic advisers touted ""fantastic"" progress towards an agreement to end a dispute with the Asian country.

""The upshot is that it is probably too soon to call the bottom of the current economic cycle,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note after the survey. ""Indeed, we expect growth to continue to come under pressure until the middle of this year.""

But there were signs of bottoming too: The Caixin China purchasing managers index rose to 49.9, recovering from its biggest drop since July 2015, even as it stayed below the 50 line that separates contraction and expansion.
""There is a silver lining in that new orders are rebounding, primarily driven by domestic demand,"" said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at Natixis Asia Ltd. Still, things are looking ""ugly"" for Asian manufacturers this quarter, she said.
Japan’s PMI dropped to 48.9, its weakest reading since June 2016, while Thailand and Malaysia also worsened. PMI readings for the Philippines and Vietnam also lost ground but remained in expansionary territory, while Indonesia saw a rare increase to 50.1.
Friday’s Caixin PMI contrasts with the official reading Thursday that showed manufacturing activity contracting further.
“It’s better than expected but don’t forget that it’s Lunar New Year,” Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong, said to Bloomberg Television on China’s Friday reading. “We’re still not seeing a general recovery.”
Other reports yesterday showed Japanese factory output sank by the most in a year and South Korea’s production barely eked out a gain. Data Friday showed South Korean exports tumbled more than expected in February.
Critical Asian exporters Japan, South Korea, and Singapore all saw shipments sink in January data, with orders to China tanking by double digits in each.
While figures might be a bit distorted given fluctuation in orders around the Chinese New Year holidays, the synchronized downturn is further affirmation of weakness in global demand that’s shown up for months, and particularly an electronics sector that is coming down from a boom.
Trade-war
U.S. tariffs on China and broader trade-war uncertainties also have weighed on Asian economies, with exports data plunging across the region in early 2019 amid dwindling shipments to China, the top trading partner for many of these economies.
Global trade has been ailing as the U.S. and China struggle to find a compromise that would lift tit-for-tat tariffs that have caused collateral damage.
This week saw some relief for investors and businesses as U.S. President Donald Trump deferred a March 1 deadline that would have triggered a batch of new levies on China. The two sides are still tangling on provisions around currency manipulation and enforcement, among other structural issues.
While Trump has suggested planning a “signing ceremony” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this week cautioned that it’s too early to tell whether China will concede to U.S. demands for “significant structural changes” to the world’s No. 2 economy.
PMI reports for South Korea and Taiwan are due Monday. South Korea’s gauge has been in contraction since November while Taiwan’s is on a four-month streak of readings below 50.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports contracted at their steepest pace in nearly three years in February as demand from its major market China cooled further in yet another sign of faltering momentum in Asia's fourth-largest economy. 
Overseas sales dropped 11.1 percent in annual terms, the sharpest decline since April 2016 and marked the third month of falling shipments. A Reuters survey had predicted a 10.8 percent decline for February.
""China-bound sales are tumbling especially as memory chip prices are falling. Looking ahead, export growth should remain weak in March but shrinking of exports should bottom out March or April as demand from China recovers on stimulus measures,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Seoul-based HI Investment & Securities. 
The deepening export slump comes at a time of slowing global growth as the Sino-U.S. trade conflict disrupts world supply chains in a blow to business investment and corporate profits. 
Imports shrank by 12.6 percent in February from a year earlier, also worse than a 11.6 percent fall predicted in the survey. This resulted in a trade surplus of $3.1 billion, more than double the amount in January as imports dropped at a faster rate, according to the Korea Customs Service. 
Though trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing appear to be making some progress, export-driven Asian countries including South Korea, Japan and Taiwan are reeling from the ripple effect of the months-long trade war. 
As South Korea's exports got off to a shaky start this year with inflation showing no signs of reviving, the central bank on Thursday left the base rate unchanged at 1.75 percent.
While most analysts don't expect the central bank to cut rates anytime soon, policymakers have indicated they will keep an accommodative stance and be ready to respond if economic conditions deteriorate markedly. 
South Korea's economy, like many of its export-reliant peers globally, has stuttered in the past few quarters amid slowing world demand. 
Exports to China, which buys nearly 30 percent of South Korean goods, have been on the decline since late last year and could worsen if growth in the world's second-biggest economy slows sharply.
Shipments to China shrank for the fourth straight month in February with a 17.4 percent year-on-year slide, as sales of all key items including petrochemical goods, memory chips, displays to steel products declined, a government statement showed. 
While the Lunar New Year holiday weighed on China-bound exports, the bigger drivers for the slump are the Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing Chinese growth, Park at HI Investment & Securities said. 
Overall, South Korean exports of memory chips plummeted 25 percent in February on-year, while sales of petrochemical products and displays suffered 14.3 percent and 11 percent declines, respectively. 
South Korean markets are closed on Friday for a national holiday.

49,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",India’s Economic Growth Slows as New Risks Emerge From Pakistan,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s economy slowed considerably last quarter, with little signs of a quick recovery amid rising political tensions with neighboring Pakistan and weaker global demand.
Gross domestic product rose 6.6 percent in the three months to December from a year ago, lower than the 6.7 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey and down from a revised 7 percent in the previous quarter.
Simmering tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have the potential to hurt foreign investments and sour business sentiment in an economy that’s been one of the fastest-growing in the world, but that’s now facing weaker domestic demand and a global slowdown. That may give the Reserve Bank of India, under new Governor Shaktikanta Das, reason to cut interest rates again after February’s surprise easing.
Inflation at a 19-month low “and further weakness in growth creates space for further cuts,” economists at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., led by Samiran Chakraborty, said in a note.
Relations with Pakistan soured this week after India accused the neighbor of being responsible for a major terrorist attack in Kashmir and the two engaged in tit-for-tat airstrikes. Pakistan has struck a conciliatory tone for now, offering to release a captured Indian pilot.
“This comes at a tricky time for both sides, as India heads into the general elections in April-May 2019, while Pakistan is in a tenuous economic position,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore. Tensions are likely to overshadow the growth data, she added.
Waning consumer demand dampened momentum in the economy where domestic spending makes up about two-thirds of GDP. Growth in government consumption slowed last quarter, while exports and investments held up, data from the Central Statistics Office showed.
For the past two quarters, domestic passenger vehicle sales growth, which is an indicator of urban demand, eased, while cement production -- a measure of construction activity -- moderated slightly. Purchasing managers’ indexes also show activity in the dominant services sector has been cooling.
With the government cutting back on capital expenditure in its latest budget to curb the fiscal deficit, economists see more sluggishness.
“The slackness in government capital expenditure ahead of elections tends to have a lagged impact, affecting growth in the following quarters,” said Teresa John, economist at Nirmal Bang Equities India Pvt Ltd.
A benign inflation environment gives policy makers room to cut interest rates again. Consumer price inflation is close to 2 percent, and core inflation -- which strips out volatile food and fuel costs -- has also begun to ease. The measures are seen converging in coming months as the economy shows more signs of a slowdown. The RBI targets headline inflation at 4 percent.
“We continue to believe that fundamentals do not support any meaningful increase in inflation,” said Indranil Sen Gupta, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). “Tight liquidity reins in demand-pull inflation. Cost push inflation is contained by falling commodity prices.”

50,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>",Japan final February manufacturing PMI confirms fastest pace of decline in two-and-a-half years,"TOKYO, (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity contracted in February at the fastest pace in two-and-a-half years as factories cut back output amid shrinking domestic and export orders, a revised survey showed on Friday.
The survey highlighted the extent of the damage that the U.S.-China trade war has already inflicted on Japan and other export-oriented countries in Asia.
The Final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 48.9, slightly above a flash reading of 48.5 but below January's final 50.3.
The index fell below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since August 2016 and showed the fastest contraction since June 2016.
""Sharper reductions in output and demand drove the Japanese manufacturing economy into contraction during the midway point of Q1, compounding reductions already recorded in January,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Global trade frictions and weak domestic manufacturing demand pose considerable risks to Japan's goods producers.""
The output component of the final PMI index was 47.4, above a preliminary 47.0 but still down from a final 54.4 in January to show the fastest contraction since May 2016.
Total new orders - domestic and foreign - fell at the fastest pace since June 2016, the final survey showed, confirming economists' concerns that the trade war has hurt Japan's prospects for growth.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would delay an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods due to ""productive"" trade talks and that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet to seal a deal if progress continued.
If the two sides can narrow their differences and put an end to their trade dispute, this would ease pressure on Japan, which exports a lot of electronic parts and heavy machinery to manufacturers in China.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's capital expenditure accelerated in October-December in a sign economic growth will be revised up for the quarter, but economists warn slowing global trade may still yet hurt activity in the first half of this year.
Capital expenditure grew 5.7 percent in October-December from the same period last year, led by increased spending in the telecommunications, chemicals, and real estate sectors. That was faster than a 4.5 percent increase in the previous quarter.
Excluding software, capital expenditure rose 3.3 percent in October-December from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis after a revised 4.4 percent decline in July-September.
The data will be used to calculate revised gross domestic product figures, which are due for release on March 8.
A preliminary estimate released last month showed Japan's economy expanded an annualized 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter, bouncing back from a string of natural disasters that disrupted factory production.
Economists worry that growth will weaken in the first half of this year after separate data showed output fell by the most in a year and exports fell the most in more than two years in January due to the U.S.-China trade war.
""Growth should be revised up in the fourth quarter, but spending on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and heavy machinery is slowing globally,"" said Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""In addition, Japan's electronics sector has entered an inventory adjustment cycle. These factors will slow growth in the first and second quarter.""
Corporate recurring profits fell 7.0 percent year-on-year in October-December, the first decline in two and a half years, finance ministry data showed on Friday.
Corporate sales rose 3.7 percent year-on-year, up for a ninth straight quarter but slower than a 6.0 percent increase in July-September.
Separate data released on Friday showed Japan's jobless rate edged up to 2.5 percent in January from 2.4 percent previously.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo rose 1.1 percent year-on-year in February, a touch faster than the median estimate for a 1.0 percent annual increase, data on Friday also showed.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would delay an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods thanks to ""productive"" trade talks and that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet to seal a deal if progress continued.
The announcement was the clearest sign yet that China and the United States are closing in on a deal to end a months-long trade war that has slowed global trade.
Despite the optimism, economists expect Japan's economy to take a hit from the trade war at the start of this year. If the U.S. and China can resolve their differences, then the drag on Japan's economy could then recede.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy fell short of the Trump administration's 3 percent annual growth target in 2018 despite $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and a government spending blitz, and economists say growth will only slow from here. 
A better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter pushed gross domestic product up 2.9 percent for the year, just shy of the goal, Commerce Department data showed on Thursday.
President Donald Trump has touted the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his term and declared last July that his administration had ""accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions."" On the campaign trail, Trump boasted that he could boost annual economic growth to 4 percent, a goal that analysts always said was unachievable.
""We are moving back to a sustainable growth pace that we experienced during most of the Obama years,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""With the tax cut impacts largely done with, it is hard to see how growth can accelerate sharply.""
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter after advancing at a 3.4 percent pace in the July-September period. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.3 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
Growth in 2018 was the strongest since 2015 and better than the 2.2 percent logged in 2017. The expansion will be the longest on record in July. 
The stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter performance, which reflected solid consumer and business spending, was despite many headwinds, including financial market volatility and the United States' trade war with China, raising optimism that an anticipated slowdown this year would not be abrupt.
The fiscal stimulus is believed to have peaked sometime in the fourth quarter. December economic data such as retail sales, exports, homebuilding and business spending on equipment weakened sharply. 
In addition, most manufacturing measures softened in January and February, and motor vehicle demand has eased. 
The labor market is also exhibiting signs of cooling, with a report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing the number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits rising to a 10-month high in the week ended Feb. 16.
""The first quarter won't be this good,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""As the stimulus fades and the lagged impact of past monetary tightening continues to feed through, we expect GDP growth to slow to 2.2 percent this year.""
Slowing growth together with weakening global demand and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union, support the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" stance towards raising interest rates further this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed the U.S. central bank's position in his testimonies before lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Inflation was largely muted in the fourth quarter.
The dollar trimmed losses against a basket of currencies on the GDP data and was last trading little changed. U.S. Treasury prices fell, while stocks on Wall Street were lower following weak earnings from a handful of companies.
SOLID CONSUMER SPENDING
The fourth-quarter GDP report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the government that ended on Jan. 25, which affected the collection and processing of economic data. The Commerce Department said it could not quantify the full effects of the shutdown on fourth-quarter GDP growth.
Economists expect the longest shutdown in history will hurt growth in the first quarter. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a still strong 2.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending grew at a robust 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter.
Consumption continues to be underpinned by a strong labor market, with inflation-adjusted income at the disposal of households jumping at a 4.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter compared to a 2.6 percent pace in the prior period.
A moderation in spending is, however, likely amid reports 2018 tax refunds have been smaller than in the previous years. 
Business spending on equipment accelerated in the fourth quarter from the prior period, growing at a 6.7 percent rate, after losing speed since the first quarter of 2018.
The trade deficit widened further as a combination of the U.S.-China trade dispute, strong dollar and weakening global demand restrained export growth. The trade tensions also led businesses to hoard imports.
The trade shortfall subtracted 0.22 percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP growth after slicing off 2 percentage points in the July-September period. With consumer spending slowing, some of the imports ended up in warehouses, accelerating the pace of inventory accumulation.
While that offset some of the drag on GDP growth from the trade deficit, the piling up of stock is bad news for first-quarter growth. 
Inventories increased at a $97.1 billion rate in the fourth quarter after rising at an $89.8 billion pace in the July-September quarter. Inventory investment added 0.13 percentage point to GDP growth last quarter after contributing 2.33 percentage points in the prior period. 
""There was a rapid buildup of inventories in the fourth quarter, so inventories likely will be a headwind for growth in the future,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Residential construction contracted at a 3.5 percent rate, marking the fourth straight quarterly decline. Homebuilding has been weighed down by higher mortgage rates, land and labor shortages as well a tariffs on imported lumber. 

Government investment increased at a 0.4 percent rate, the slowest since the third quarter of 2017. Nondefense investment contracted at a 5.6 percent rate, the biggest decline in five years, likely reflecting the effects of the five-week government shutdown.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 225,000 for the week ended Feb. 23, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
The Labor Department said no states were estimated. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,000 to 229,000 last week.
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 79,000 to 1.81 million for the week ended Feb. 16, the highest level since April 2018. The four-week moving average of these so-called continuing claims rose 6,750 to 1.76 million.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy lost momentum in the approach to a general election, with the annual growth rate slipping to 6.6 percent in the October-December quarter, dragged down by weaker consumer demand. 
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast growth of 6.9 percent for the latest quarter, compared with a downwardly revised 7.0 percent in July-September.
The Statistics Ministry also revised the economic growth estimate for the current fiscal year ending March to 7.0 percent from an earlier estimate of 7.2 percent.
(Graphic: India's annual economic growth - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UcxJr0)
The data for 2018's last quarter comes amid tension between India and Pakistan following tit-for-tat air strikes in the wake of a Feb. 14 suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
Some economists said if the tensions escalate, it could dissuade foreign investors from entering India and hit tourist inflows, impacting growth slightly in coming quarters.
The quarterly data released on Thursday is the last to be published before a general election due by May in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi hopes to win a second term. 
The growth pace in October-December was still faster than China's 6.4 percent, but India's economy has decelerated from the more than two-year high of 8.2 percent growth in April-June 2018.
""The number is disappointing,"" said Anita Gandhi, director at Arihant Capital Markets, adding the GDP growth could be seen by voters as a report card on the government. 
""People will see it on a year-to-year basis, not just a quarter and this could have an impact given elections are near,"" she said. 
Data from the Statistics Ministry showed the decline in growth was led by a slowdown in consumer spending and investments. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for near 60 percent of the economy, slowed to an 8.4 percent rise annually in the December quarter, compared to a revised 9.9 percent rise in the previous quarter. 
Gross fixed capital formation - which include spending on roads, ports, airports and power plants - rose 10.6 percent compared with a revised 10.2 percent annual increase in the previous quarter. 
The manufacturing sector grew at 6.7 percent annually, the data showed, while services, including construction, grew at 7.6 percent from a year ago period.
Critics says Modi has not done enough for the manufacturing sector or created sufficient jobs for the nearly 20 million youths entering the job market each year.
Growing signs of weakness in the economy, most alarmingly in rural communities where incomes have been hit by falling farm prices, forced Modi this month to increase state spending, and make direct cash transfers to farmers. 
That could marginally help growth rates, but also increase the government's debt.

On Feb. 7, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent, and changed its stance to ""neutral"" to boost a slowing economy as inflation has come down sharply.

Prices rose 0.1 percent from a month ago in January, government data showed, compared with December's revised 2.3 percent decline.
Thomas Lam, executive director of Knight Frank, said while the data showed prices stabilizing, a sustained recovery was unlikely.
""Now the market is relatively stable, I forecast the index will rise another 0.5 percent in February,"" Lam said.
""I expect the property will continue to correct this year.""
Knight Frank maintains its full year forecast for a 10 percent decline this year with vulnerability seen in the so-called ""nano flat"" sector.
Over the past decade, ultra low interest rates, limited housing supply and large capital flows from mainland Chinese buyers helped push housing prices up more than 200 percent. That bubble was burst in the middle of last year and prices have since come off 9 percent.
A continued correction could lead to more cases of negative equity on residential mortgage loans, which resurfaced for the first time in two years in the last quarter of 2018.
Affordability is still an issue. A flat of 60 square meters (646 square ft) on Hong Kong Island cost an average of HK$10.14 million ($1.29 million) in January, according to official data.
On Wednesday, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year that estimated public housing production for the next 5 years is 100,400 units, while private sector will complete 18,800 units annually, up 20 percent from the past 5 years.
He added the government has no intention to withdraw any demand-side management measures at this stage, which includes extra stamp duty, as home prices are still above people's affordability levels.

This month’s manufacturing PMI came in at 49.2, down from 49.5 in January. The February reading was expected to remain unchanged from last month.
A reading below 50 means the manufacturing sector contracted, while a PMI above 50 represents an expansion.
Meanwhile, non-manufacturing PMI slowed to 54.3 from January’s 54.7.
Analysts noted that the February PMI reading might be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year, as activity in both the manufacturing and services sectors is typically cut back or halted altogether.
The ongoing trade war was cited as negatively impacting Chinese factories, although recent signs suggested the U.S. and China might still be able to reach an agreement.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China contracted to a three-year low in February as export orders fell at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis, highlighting deepening cracks in an economy facing weak demand at home and abroad.
The gloomy findings are likely to reinforce views that the world's second-largest economy is still losing steam, after growth last year cooled to a near 30-year low. 
Even with increasing government stimulus to spur activity, concerns are growing that China may be at risk of a sharper slowdown if current Sino-U.S. trade talks fail to relieve some of the pressure.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.2 in February from 49.5 in January, pointing to a contraction in activity for the third straight month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Thursday. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the manufacturing gauge would stay unchanged from January's 49.5. China's factory activity has been generally softening since last May.
""Unless the trade war truly turns into an extended truce, the weakening trend may not end quickly,"" Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING, said in a note. ""As such we expect March's PMI to fall, too.""
Manufacturing output contracted in February for the first time since January 2009, during the depths of the global crisis. A breakdown of the survey's findings showed the output sub-index fell to 49.5 from 50.9 the previous month. 
Manufacturers continued to cut jobs more aggressively, a trend Beijing is closely watching as its weighs more support measures. The pace of job-shedding was the fastest since December 2015.
New export orders shrank for a ninth straight month, and at a sharper rate, in the latest sign of deteriorating global demand. The sub-index fell to 45.2, the lowest since February 2009, from 46.9 in January. 
But total new orders -- an indicator of future activity -- edged back into expansionary territory, suggesting some improvement in domestic demand. The sub-index rose to 50.6 from 49.6 in January, after falling for two consecutive months.
China watchers typically advise caution over interpreting the country's economic data early in the year because of the timing of the week-long Lunar New Year holidays.
Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which began on Feb. 4 this year. But workers, business owners and labor activists have told Reuters that companies have shut earlier than usual as the trade war bites, with some likely to close for good.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's joint venture in China has quietly begun dismissing thousands of its workers due to weak auto sales in the world’s second-largest economy, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.
Record lending by Chinese banks in January and a sharp rebound in its stock markets have lifted some of the gloom hanging over the economy.
But analysts say it will take months to see if the strong credit impulse translates into improved business activity, assuming companies are borrowing for fresh expansion or investment, not merely refinancing existing debt.
The PMI survey showed smaller firms were still bearing the brunt of the pressure in February while large firms - many of them state-owned enterprises - stayed afloat, despite targeted policy measures to help struggling private firms refinance and increase capacity. 
Some economists believe China's economic growth could even dip below 6 percent in the first half -- from 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter -- before stabilizing later in the year as a series of support measures in 2018 and 2019 begin to take effect.
""The cooling property sector, the end of the durable goods replacement cycle and the payback effect from the previous front-loading of exports have been and will remain headwinds,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, wrote in a note.
Uncertainty also hangs over ongoing China-U.S. trade talks.
President Donald Trump said on Monday that he may soon sign a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to end the countries' trade war, if the two sides can bridge remaining differences
But the lead U.S. negotiator said on Wednesday it was too early to predict the outcome.
U.S. issues with China are ""too serious"" to be resolved with promises from Beijing to purchase more U.S. goods and any deal between the two countries must be include a way to ensure commitments are met, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.
Growth in China's services industry also cooled in February after rebounding for two straight months as new orders rose at a slower pace, another sign of strain as consumers turn more cautious about spending. 
Services growth was mainly dragged by a notable slowdown in construction activity, suggesting recent fiscal stimulus through more bond issuance has not been reflected in infrastructure investment. The sub-index fell near 2 percentage points to 59.2 in February.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output posted the biggest decline in a year in January in a sign slowing Chinese demand and the Sino-U.S. trade war were taking a toll on the country's manufacturing sector, a major driver of economic growth.
The 3.7 percent fall in output, which closely tracks broader economic growth, was bigger than the median market forecast for a 2.5 percent drop and marked the third straight month of contraction, the data showed on Thursday.
The world's third largest economy faces a bumpy road ahead with manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in the report expecting output to rebound 5.0 percent in February but decrease 1.6 percent in March.
The ministry cut its assessment of output saying it is ""stalling"". Previously it was described as picking up gradually.
Japanese policymakers worry that sluggish output may drag on economic growth as exporters curb shipments and manufacturers halt production due to a sharp drop in demand from China in the face of the Sino-U.S. trade war.
U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this week he may soon sign a deal to end a trade war with Chinese President Xi Jinping if their countries can bridge remaining differences.
Trump has delayed an increase in U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and extended his March 1 deadline for a deal.
Trump's decision avoided another escalation in a trade war between the world's two largest economies that has cost both countries billions of dollars and roiled global markets.
Data released last week showed Japan's exports logged their worst drop in more than two years in January as China-bound shipments tumbled, fuelling concerns about the outlook for export-reliant Japanese economy.
Other data showed a key gauge of Japanese capital spending showed overseas orders for machinery fell the most in more than a decade in December, and business sentiment soured to a two-year low.
Adding to the broader gloom, retail sales grew just 0.6 percent year-on-year in January, slowing sharply from a 1.3 percent gain in the previous month.
On the seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales dropped 2.3 percent month-on-month in January, a worrying sign for private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy.

Japan's economy rebounded in the fourth quarter as business and consumer spending recovered from the slump caused by natural disasters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. goods trade deficit widened sharply in December as slowing global demand and a strong dollar weighed on exports, another sign that economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter.
Other data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed new orders for U.S.-made goods barely rose in December and business spending on equipment was much weaker than previously thought, pointing to a softening in manufacturing activity.
The reports, which added to weak December data on retail sales and housing starts, could prompt economists to cut fourth-quarter GDP estimates. But some of the drag on growth from the goods trade gap and weak business spending on equipment could be offset by a strong increase in inventories in December.
The goods trade deficit jumped 12.8 percent to $79.5 billion in December, boosted also by an increase in imports. Exports fell 2.8 percent amid steep declines in shipments of foods, industrial supplies and capital goods. Imports increased 2.4 percent driven by food and capital and consumer goods. 
Retail inventories increased 0.9 percent in December after falling 0.4 percent in the prior month. Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product, rebounded 1.0 percent in December after dropping 0.9 percent in November.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are currently around a 2.0 percent annualized rate. The government will publish the fourth-quarter GDP report on Thursday. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
U.S. stocks added to losses after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said U.S. issues with China are ""too serious"" to be resolved by promises of more purchases of U.S. goods by Beijing. Prices of U.S. Treasuries modestly pared losses, while the dollar added to gains against the yen and euro.
FACTORY ACTIVITY SLOWING
In another report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said factory goods orders edged up 0.1 percent in December amid declining demand for machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Data for November was revised slightly up to show factory orders falling 0.5 percent instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent drop. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.5 percent in December.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is slowing as some of the boost to capital spending from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. In addition, the strong dollar and cooling growth in Europe and China are hurting exports. Lower oil prices are also slowing purchases of equipment for oil and gas well drilling.
In December, orders for machinery dropped 1.0 percent after tumbling 2.0 percent in November. Orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery plunged 5.2 percent after rising 1.9 percent in November. There were also decreases in orders for industrial machinery as well as turbines, generators and other power transmission equipment in December.
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.3 percent after dropping 2.6 percent in November. Orders for transportation equipment rose 3.2 percent in December after increasing 3.1 percent in the prior month.
Orders for civilian aircraft and parts jumped 28.4 percent in December. Motor vehicles and parts orders rose 2.4 percent.
The Commerce Department also said December orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, fell 1.0 percent instead of the 0.7 percent drop reported last week.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods declined 1.1 percent in November. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were unchanged in December instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent increase.

Core capital goods shipments fell 0.2 percent in November.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 09:03AM ET</span>",Canada's inflation rate drops on lower gasoline prices,"By Julie Gordon
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Lower gasoline prices pulled Canada's annual inflation rate in January down to 1.4 percent from 2.0 percent in December, reinforcing market expectations that imminent interest rate hikes are off the table.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast the rate would be 1.5 percent. January marks the second time in the last 12 months that the rate has slipped below the Bank of Canada's 2.0 percent target. 
The central bank has raised rates five times since July 2017, though Governor Stephen Poloz indicated last week that while interest rates need to move up into a neutral range, he was in no rush to resume monetary tightening.
""With the core measure of inflation within the central bank's range, the Bank of Canada is likely to remain on the sidelines and continue to monitor the data,"" said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada. 
The bank is due to announce its next interest rate decision on March 6 and analysts largely expect no change. 
Energy costs declined 6.9 percent in January from the previous year, driven by a 14.2 percent plunge in gasoline prices. That helped drive the transportation component down 0.4 percent, its first 12-month decline since July 2016, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday. 
""I think the big story is we're seeing the late 2018 slide in oil prices fully show up in the headline inflation,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
Adjusted to remove gasoline, the annual inflation rate was 2.1 percent.
Service costs were up 2.7 percent, though down from 3.5 percent in December as transitory pressures eased, Statistics Canada said. Month-to-month decreases in air transportation and travel tours followed the end of the holiday travel season.
The Bank of Canada's three core inflation measures were unchanged, with CPI common, which the bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, at 1.9 percent.

The Canadian dollar pared gains on the news, touching C$1.3152 to the U.S. dollar.

71,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 08:31AM ET</span>",Canadian Annual Inflation 1.4% in January,"Investing.com - The overall rate of inflation in Canada fell in January, data on Wednesday showed, casting doubt on whether or not the Bank of Canada will follow the Federal Reserve in keeping interest rates unchanged.
The consumer price index rose 1.4% last month, compared with the same month a year earlier. Prices rose by 0.1% from a month earlier.
Economists had expected annual inflation to rise by 1.5% and monthly inflation to rise by 0.2%. Core inflation, which excludes gasoline, was up 1.5% from a year earlier  and rose by 0.3% from the previous month.
The Bank of Canada aims to keep inflation at 2%, the midpoint of a target range of 1% to 3% over the medium term.
Stephen Poloz, governor of the central bank, said last week that it was uncertain when the bank would raise the benchmark rate and that it would scrutinize incoming data in light of domestic headwinds. The bank is especially concerned about the housing market, business investment levels and global trade uncertainty.
""Given these uncertainties, we have kept interest rates unchanged at 1.75% since last October,"" Poloz said last week. ""We will remain decidedly data-dependent as the domestic and international situations evolve.""
The bank’s next interest rate announcement is on March 6."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy appeared to be losing momentum in the approach to a general election that must be held by May, as a Reuters survey of economists forecast that growth slipped to 6.9 percent annually in the October-December quarter.
If the forecast proves accurate, India will post its slowest growth in five quarters, making it harder for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to persuade voters that government policies were delivering economic success.
The gross domestic product and the second advance estimates for the 2018/19 fiscal year ending in March will be released on Thursday around 1200 GMT.
Weaker domestic and external demand were key factors behind the economists expectations of sub-7 percent growth. India would still be growing faster than China's 6.4 percent growth in the same quarter, but its economy has decelerated from the more than two-year high of 8.2 percent growth posted in the April-June quarter.
The current growth numbers may look respectable, but Modi faces a criticism that he has not done enough for the manufacturing sector and create enough jobs for millions of youth entering the jobs market every month. 
Growing signs of weakness in India, most alarmingly the desperation of rural communities whose income have been hit by falling prices for farm produce, forced Modi earlier this month to increase state spending, and make direct cash transfers to farmers. That could marginally help growth rates, but it will increase the government's debt.
This month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent, and changed its stance to ""neutral"" to boost a slowing economy as inflation has come down sharply.
""The economic growth slowed in December quarter following weaker consumption as reflected by auto sales and slowdown in credit after a crisis in non-banking financial company sector,"" A. Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai said.
Prasanna said economic growth in December quarter could fall to as low as 6.4 percent. 
Economic growth could suffer from a possible slowdown in state spending in the two months before the election.
But, Prasanna and other analysts still expected a pick up in coming quarters due to rising private investments and consumer demand, helped by lower interest rates and a fall in global oil prices. 
Average industrial capacity utilization during the four quarters that ended in September 2018 was about 74.5 per cent although the new orders growth has moderated, according to the RBI estimates released earlier this month.
Year-on-year growth in the industrial output in November and December 2018 were low at 0.3 per cent and 2.4 per cent, compared to the average growth of 5.7 per cent in the preceding seven months of 2018-19.
The country has underperformed in the manufacturing sector - though emerging as the world's sixth biggest auto manufacturer, and expanding production of smart phones.
Manufacturing's share of GDP has risen just 1.5 percent in last three years to stand at nearly 18 percent, and investors complain that higher taxes, lack of efficient infrastructure and regulatory red tape make India a difficult place to work. 
Inflows of foreign direct investment has slowed, dropping 7 percent to $33.5 billion in the nine months between April and December 2018, reflecting investors concerns that Modi's business-friendly government faced a tough contest and whoever wins the election could have a hard time pressing forward with needed reforms. 
""The government needs to focus on addressing issues related to land, labor tax, the policy regime related to infrastructure, and overall ease of doing business,"" Upasana Chachra, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note earlier this week.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment dipped for an eighth consecutive month to a new two-year low in February as managers in industry became more downbeat about inventories, order books and production expectations.
Euro zone economic sentiment slipped to 106.1 points in February from an upwardly revised 106.3 in January, the European Commission said on Wednesday, marking the lowest level since November 2016.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a slightly sharper decline to 106.0. 
The survey adds to evidence that economic prospects of the 19-member euro zone for the start of 2019 are muted after only modest growth of 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.
Sentiment in industry fell for a third consecutive month to -0.4 points in February from 0.6 points in January, well below market expectations of 0.1.
By contrast, sentiment in services, a sector which produces two thirds of the euro zone GDP, picked up to 12.1 from 11.0 in January, against expectations that it would be unchanged, although the chief cause for the improvement was the past business situation.
The mood of consumers also picked in February up to -7.4 after January's -7.9, while sentiment in retail trade was less gloomy at -1.6 points in February from -2.1 in January.
Among the major countries, overall economic sentiment improved in the Netherlands, but was lower in France and Italy and very slightly in Germany and unchanged in Spain.

A separate business climate indicator, which helps point to the phase of the business cycle, was unchanged in February at 0.69, above the 0.60 average forecast in the Reuters poll. For January and February, this was the lowest reading since January 2017.

The European Commission said Wednesday that its indicator for business and consumer economic sentiment in the euro area dropped 0.2 points to 106.1 in February, hitting its lowest level since November 2016.
“Broadly unchanged euro-area sentiment resulted from weaker industry and construction confidence in combination with more upbeat signals from the services sector, as well as, to a lesser extent, retail trade and consumers,” the European Commission said in the report.
In the wider European Union, the headline indicator dropped 0.9 points, due to a significant deterioration of 4.5 points in the U.K., a non-euro zone economy.
The EU faces economic uncertainty as it negotiates the U.K.’s departure from the bloc - currently scheduled to take place on March 29 - and future trade agreements between the two parties are unresolved.
Adding to concern for the region’s manufacturers, Europe is awaiting U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision on the possibility of raising tariffs on European automobiles imported stateside.

Fearing that banks may shut access to credit to firms and reinforce the downturn, the ECB is now preparing to give lenders more cheap, long-term funding.
It is also expected to delay its first post-crisis rate hike until next year, keeping borrowing costs record low for longer, to stimulate growth.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong unveiled a less expansionary budget for fiscal year 2019/20 on Wednesday, though with relief measures for individuals and businesses at a time of economic uncertainty and trade tensions as growth slowed sharply.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan said annual growth halved in the fourth quarter and the outlook for the financial hub is clouded by a trade war between Washington and Beijing.
Hong Kong's open and trade-reliant economy has been buffeted by external risks, including an economic slowdown in China, cooling property prices and stock market volatility.
Chan said the economy grew 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the weakest increase since the first quarter of 2016, and slower than downwardly revised 2.8 percent growth in the previous three months. 
The economy grew 3 percent for the full-year 2018, slightly slower than the government's forecast of 3.2 percent.
Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING, said in a report the weaker than expected growth was due to spillover from the U.S.-China trade dispute.
""This was mainly a result of the trade war, which dampened export activities and related jobs in Hong Kong and on the mainland, with negative feedback into consumption in Hong Kong.""
The trade-reliant economy is forecast to expand 2-3 percent this year and average 3 percent growth from 2020-2023, Chan said in his televised budget speech. 
Hong Kong is expected to record a budget surplus of HK$58.7 billion ($7.5 billion) for 2018/2019, Chan said, less than half the bumper surplus of HK$148.9 billion announced for the previous financial year. 
Hong Kong's economy is vulnerable to simmering trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and, if unresolved, they pose broader risks to the city this year.
As one of the most open and free economies in the world, Hong Kong's growth is also highly reliant on capital, trade, tourist and investment flows from China.
For budget highlights, click on
LESS EXPANSIONARY BUDGET 
Chan's budget this year was less expansionary than last year with fewer big ticket expenditures though there were a mix of relief measures for individuals and businesses.
Business registration fees were waived for companies this year, and greater funding options would be provided to help those facing liquidity difficulties. Some business sectors, including film, will also be injected with fresh funds to preserve film heritage. 
Tax cuts were pared back slightly from the year before, with a 75 percent cut in salaries and profits tax, both capped at HK$20,000. 
Chan, however, increased spending for the city's strained public hospitals with an extra HK$5 billion ($637 million) allocated, and healthcare coupons for elderly residents.
On the frothy property market, now one of the most expensive in the world, Chan said the government has ""no intention to withdraw"" existing cooling measures despite a recent easing back of property prices.
Some analysts predict prices could rise as much as 10 percent in 2019 after only a short-lived correction.
Property owners, however, were given a one-off full year waiver of property rates, as an alleviation measure, reducing government revenues by HK$15 billion ($1.9 billion).
The financial secretary also called a recently unveiled development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area as a ""milestone"" that would bring ""golden opportunities for Hong Kong to explore new directions, open up new horizons and add new impetus"".

The government also announced HK$6 billion to enhance the city's famous Victoria Harbour, by nearly doubling the length of waterfront promenades to 34 kilometers by 2029.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation's (REC) gauge of confidence in the economy slid to -20 in the three months to January, the lowest reading since the survey started in mid-2016 and down from -14 in the previous report.
The survey adds to a raft of business surveys showing that businesses have put the brakes on investment plans ahead of Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union on March 29.
Lawmakers in London have yet to approve a deal that would smooth Britain's divorce with the EU, leaving open the prospect of a disorderly departure - although on Tuesday Prime Minister Theresa May offered lawmakers the chance to vote next month in favor of a delay.
""With employers' confidence levels at a low point and hiring intentions for both permanent and temporary staff dropping in today's survey, there can no longer be any argument: uncertainty is damaging for job creation,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
By contrast, consumer confidence has held up relatively well, although a separate survey showed households are being hit with higher prices in shops. 
The British Retail Consortium said shop prices rose at an annual pace of 0.7 percent in February, the highest inflation rate since March 2013 and following a 0.4 percent increase in January.
""While price rises over the last six months have been relatively modest, a no deal Brexit would have a much more immediate and dramatic effect,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
A Citi/YouGov survey earlier this week showed expectations for consumer price inflation among Britain's public hit a joint five-year high in February. 
Although consumer price inflation hit two-year low in January, the Bank of England has said this mainly reflects a fall in the price of oil and that domestic price pressures are strengthening. 

The REC jobs outlook surveyed 611 companies between Nov. 1 and Jan. 25.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding tumbled to a more than two-year low in December as construction of both single and multi-family housing declined, the latest indication that the economy had lost momentum in the fourth quarter.
But there was some good news on the economy, with other data on Tuesday showing a rebound in consumer confidence in February after three straight monthly declines. Still, the economy's outlook continues to be overshadowed by fears of a slowdown in global growth, fading fiscal stimulus, trade tensions and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union.
These risks were again highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he reaffirmed before lawmakers on Tuesday the U.S. central bank's ""patient"" stance towards raising interest rates further this year.
""Regardless, the economy is moderating ... which means the Fed should be able to maintain its cautious approach to monetary policy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Housing starts dropped 11.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.078 million units in December, the weakest reading since September 2016. Data for November was revised down to show starts at a 1.214 million unit rate instead of the previously reported pace of 1.256 million units.
Other details of the report were also downbeat, suggesting the housing market could remain sluggish for a while despite an easing in mortgage rates. Housing completions hit a more than one-year low in December, and while building permits rose, they were driven by the volatile multi-family housing segment.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that housing starts would slip to a pace of 1.250 million units last month. 
The release of the December housing starts and building permits report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. No date has been set for the release of January's report.
The Commerce Department said while delays in data collection could make it more difficult to determine the exact start and completion dates of construction, ""processing and data quality were monitored and no significant issues were identified.""
The report joined weak December retail sales and business spending plans on equipment in suggesting that economic growth cooled down significantly at the tail end of 2018. It also implied that residential investment likely contracted in the fourth quarter, extending a decline that began in early 2018.
As a result, the Atlanta Fed trimmed its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
A second report from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed its consumer confidence index increased 9.7 points to a reading of 131.4 in February after being held back by financial market volatility and the government shutdown. 
Despite the rebound in confidence, the Conference Board said it expected the pace of economic growth to moderate in 2019. 
The U.S. dollar fell to a three-week low against a basket of major currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed in volatile trade.
SOFT PATCH
The housing market hit a soft patch last year amid higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages, which led to tight inventories and more expensive homes. 
But there are some glimmers of hope. A third report from S&P/Case-Shiller on Tuesday showed house prices in the 20-metro area increased 4.2 percent from a year ago in December, the smallest gain since November 2014, after rising 4.6 percent in November.
Slowing house price inflation was also corroborated by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing house prices rose 0.3 percent on a monthly basis in December after advancing 0.4 percent in November.
Moderating house prices together with declining mortgage rates and steadily rising wages could make home buying more affordable, though economists expect the housing market weakness to persist at least through the first half of 2019.
""We do expect the housing data to pick up at some point in response to the recent decline in mortgage rates, but it likely will take some time before we start to see firming across many of the relevant figures,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
A survey last week showed homebuilder confidence increased in February, but builders continued to say costs were being kept high by land and labor shortages, and tariffs on lumber and other key building materials.
Permits for future home construction rose 0.3 percent to a rate of 1.326 million units in December. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 6.7 percent to a rate of 758,000 units in December, the lowest level since August 2016.
It was the fourth straight monthly decline in single-family homebuilding. Single-family starts dropped in the Northeast, Midwest and West, but rose in the South.
Permits to build single-family homes fell 2.2 percent in December to a pace of 829,000 units. Starts for the multi-family housing segment dropped 20.4 percent to a rate of 320,000 units in December. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes rose 4.9 percent to a pace of 497,000 units.

Housing completions fell 2.7 percent to 1.097 million units, the fewest since September 2017. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

Morgan survey showed on Tuesday.
The margin of investors who said they were ""long,"" or holding more Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, over those who said they were ""short,"" or holding fewer Treasuries than their benchmarks, rose to 11 percent, the highest since Sept. 12, 2016. A week ago, they were net long by 5 percent, according to the survey.
Fed policymakers refrained from hiking interest rates further at their Jan. 29-30 policy meeting so that they have more time to assess the effects of a global economic slowdown.
They also signaled the Fed may slow or end reductions to its $4 trillion balance sheet, a process it had previously characterized as being on automatic pilot, according to minutes of the Fed's policy meeting last month released on Feb. 20.
Twenty-eight percent of the investors surveyed said on Monday they were long on U.S. government bonds, up slightly from 27 percent the previous week, the J.P. Morgan survey showed.
The share of investors who said they were short Treasuries fell to 17 percent from 22 percent a week earlier.
The percentage of investors who said they were ""neutral,"" or holding Treasuries equal to their portfolio benchmarks, rose to 55 percent from 51 percent a week ago, J.P. Morgan said.
Positions among active clients, which include market makers and hedge funds, suggested they were neutral on longer-dated Treasuries. Active longs and shorts were equal at 20 percent for a second week.
On Tuesday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was 2.650 percent, little changed from 2.645 percent a week earlier.

81,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises in February,"Investing.com - Confidence among U.S. consumers rebounded in February, breaking a streak of three-straight monthly declines as the longest federal government shutdown in modern history ended.
The Conference Board said Tuesday its index of consumer confidence rose to 131.4 in February, after three consecutive months of decline. That was ahead of expectations for a reading of 124.7.
The figures offer some reassurance about the health of the economy after shockingly weak retail sales data for January were released last week. It is also broadly consistent with a report on the labor market at the start of the month that wages are still rising and the economy still adding jobs at a steady pace.
Consumer expectations seemed to have recovered, said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board.
""Looking ahead, consumers expect the economy to continue expanding,"" Franco said. ""However, according to The Conference Board’s economic forecasts, the pace of expansion is expected to moderate in 2019.”
The Present Situation Index rose from 170.2 to 173.5, while the Expectations Index increased to 103.4 in February from 89.4 in January, the Conference Board said.
The index looks at U.S. consumers' views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity."

Housing starts tumbled by 11.2% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.078 million units at the end of the year, the Commerce Department said. That was much worse than forecasts for a drop of 0.5% to 1.250 million and the weakest reading since September 2016.

84,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 05:51AM ET</span>","Bank of England Stands Pat on Interest Rate Outlook, Focus on Brexit Reaction","Investing.com - The Bank of England reiterated its stance that interest rates could move in either direction depending on the outcome of negotiations for the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union.
In the Inflation Report hearings delivered to the U.K. Treasury Select Committee, BoE governor Mark Carney repeated his view that Brexit was causing tension for British consumers and businesses but promised that the central bank would “provide all stimulus possible” in the event of a no-deal outcome.
Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee, told the committee that, in the event of a shock to consumer confidence from a 'no-deal' Brexit, the central bank would likely hold policy steady or cut interest rates.
However, that risk appeared to have shrunk considerably Tuesday, after both the U.K.'s major parties appeared to shift their policy stances on Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May is set to propose to her cabinet that the government rule out the possibility of leaving the EU without a transitional agreement in place. The opposition Labour Party, meanwhile, has said it will back a second referendum on Brexit if there is no majority in parliament for a withdrawal agreement.
Carney, however, noted that if the economy performed as currently forecast a gradual increase in rates would be warranted.
The hearings come after the Bank slashed its growth forecasts earlier this month. It now sees the British economy growing only 1.2%, the slowest pace since the financial crisis, amid uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s departure from the EU and the broader economic slowdown worldwide.
“The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in economic data, and more fundamentally is creating a series of tensions in the economy,"" Carney said at the Feb. 7 press conference following the BoE’s decision to hold interest rates steady.
“Although many companies are stepping up their contingency planning, the economy as a whole is still not yet prepared for a no deal, no transition exit,” he warned.
The BoE left the possibility of rate hikes “at a gradual pace and to a limited extent” on the table at that meeting."

The reading of 95 points marked the highest level for the consumer confidence index since October, which was the month before ""yellow vests"" protesters started weekend marches against high living costs and President Emmanuel Macron's policies.
The increase in the index by the national INSEE statistics office, which beat the average forecasts of economists, came as Macron's costly measures to boost workers' income and quell the protests kicked in this month. 
In December, the French leader decided to speed up an increase in benefits received by the poorest workers, halt a planned rise in fuel taxes, and reduce taxes on overtime, for a total cost of 10 billion euros ($11.35 billion).
""The French consumer is recovering quickly,"" Pictet economist Frederik Ducrozet said. ""Confidence is rising post-'gilets jaunes' as Macron's stimulus measures kick in and unemployment fears recede.""
The national statistics office, INSEE, said the number of consumers who had observed an improvement in their finances in the past year had increased, while more of them also expected the increase to continue in the future.
Households fears of unemployment also dropped markedly this month, INSEE said.
France's unemployment rate fell unexpectedly at the end of last year to its lowest level since the start of 2009, official data showed earlier this month.
The brighter outlook is good news for Macron, whose popularity has started to recover from its worst level at the peak of the ""yellow vest"" crisis in December.
The 41-year-old leader has launched a series of debates across the country aimed at reconnecting with voters, particularly in rural areas.
Weekly ""yellow vest"" marches continue every Saturday, but turnout has fallen and support for the movement among the broader public as waned, polls show.
Named after the fluorescent jackets motorists must keep in their cars, the grassroot ""yellow vest"" protests started in mid-November as a revolt against high prices at the pump, before morphing into a broader challenge to Macron's pro-business policies.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 01:48PM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale inventories post biggest rise in over five years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories increased by the most in more than five years in December as sales fell for a third straight month, suggesting an unintended piling up of goods at wholesalers that could be flagging a slowdown in demand.
The surge in wholesale stocks reported by the Commerce Department on Monday, however, implied inventories were probably less of a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter than previously thought. As result, economists boosted their fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as high as a 2.4 percent annualized rate.
""While the jump in inventories in December represents an upside risk to the fourth-quarter GDP report coming out on Thursday, declining wholesale and retail sales in December could be another sign of weaker demand and slow GDP growth in the first quarter,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Wholesale inventories surged 1.1 percent, the largest gain since October 2013. Data for November was revised higher to show wholesale inventories rising 0.4 percent instead of 0.3 percent as previously reported. Wholesale inventories increased 7.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories at wholesalers rising 0.3 percent in December.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP growth rose 1.1 percent in December. The December wholesale inventory report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.
GROWTH ESTIMATES RAISED
Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised their fourth-quarter GDP estimate to a 1.9 percent rate from a 1.4 percent pace. Data forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers lifted its forecast by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.4 percent rate.
""Today's data suggest a more modest drag from inventories on fourth-quarter growth,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
Inventory investment added 2.33 percentage points to the third quarter's 3.4 percent annualized growth rate. 
Reports on December retail sales and business spending plans on equipment have also pointed to a slowdown in growth at the tail end of 2018. The government will publish its delayed fourth-quarter GDP report on Thursday.
In December, wholesale auto inventories increased 0.9 percent after gaining 0.6 percent in November. Hardware inventories jumped 1.7 percent, the biggest increase since June 2012, after rising 1.2 percent in November. Furniture stocks rose 2.4 percent, the most since November 2012. 
Apparel inventories jumped 3.8 percent, the largest advance since September 2010.
Sales at wholesalers dropped 1.0 percent in December after falling 1.2 percent in November. Some of the drop in sales reflected weak prices. Motor vehicles sales decreased 2.2 percent, the biggest fall since February 2017. There were also declines in sales of petroleum, hardware, paper and metals.

At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.33 months to clear shelves, the most since November 2016, up from 1.30 months in November.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>",India's foreign direct investment inflows fall amid pre-election uncertainty,"By Manoj Kumar and Alasdair Pal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The flow of foreign direct investment into India is dropping and may suffer its first full-year decline since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014.
The reversal from strong numbers in Modi's initial years in charge may indicate that investors are being deterred by the government's recent protectionist policies and uncertainty about this year's general election result.
Inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) dropped 7 percent to $33.5 billion in the nine months between April and December 2018, compared with $36 billion in the year-earlier period, according to figures released over the weekend.
Industry experts and some government officials said the investment inflows may remain sluggish for the next few months as investors wait to see who forms the next government after the election, which must be held by early May. 
If Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party loses power then there could be a coalition government involving the opposition Congress party and regional parties.
There is also concern among some foreign businesses about the Modi government's increasingly protectionist tilt. That was illustrated by moves at the beginning of this month to tighten rules on the ways that big foreign-controlled online retailers Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Flipkart, which is controlled by giant U.S. retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT), are allowed to operate.
Walmart last year invested $16 billion in buying 77 percent of Flipkart. It is unclear how much of that deal is reflected in the latest FDI data. 
The FDI figures, which haven't been produced for about six months and have elicited little attention as they were released without fanfare over the weekend, exclude reinvestment of profits by foreign companies already in India as well as new investment through the capital markets.
TOP FDI SOURCES LED BY SINGAPORE 
The top sources for the FDI were Singapore, with $13 billion, Mauritius $6 billion, Japan $2.2 billion and Britain with $1.1 billion. Mauritius is often used by Indians living overseas and Indian companies to route money into or out of India.
The growth of FDI inflows has been dropping dramatically since recording a 35 percent rise in the fiscal year to March 31, 2016, after Modi came to power. That sharp growth was helped by policies introduced in his first two years in power that promoted foreign investment, as well as by the certainty of having a government with a clear majority in parliament.
Initially, investors were attracted by the launch of a new nationwide sales tax in 2017, a promise (as yet unfulfilled) to bring down the corporate tax to 25 percent, and incentives to set up factories for domestic and export markets. 
India has moved up 53 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business survey to 77 in the last two years, and Modi is aiming for a top 50 spot by next year. 
But there is a growing feeling, business leaders said, that while countries such as Vietnam are offering tax holidays to investors, India has shifted toward protectionism under political pressure. 
""Lack of policy certainty along with upcoming elections are two reasons that the reduction in foreign direct investments can be attributed to,"" said Sachin Taparia, founder of Local Circles, a network of about 30,000 businesses.
By last fiscal year, ending March 31, 2018, FDI growth had slowed to just 3 percent. 
""TEMPORARY DIP""
A senior commerce and industry ministry official, who deals with foreign investors, said the fall in investment inflows was temporary and the government expects them to pick up again. 
""India has opened up almost all sectors for foreign investors,"" he said, adding that the government was investing to build infrastructure, particularly roads, ports, railways and power plants, to entice investors. 
""Unlike some other countries, we have no plans to offer tax holidays to attract investors,"" said the official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. 
Another government official said India had no plans to give any special treatment to foreign investors, and recent curbs on dubious inflows of funds from tax havens were one of the reasons behind fall in capital inflows. 
Some investors, however, said they remain bullish on the world's sixth largest economy. 
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) COO Jonathan Gray, who heads the world's largest private equity funds by assets raised, said that India was becoming more attractive to foreign investors under Modi's rule.
""This country has lacked infrastructure, not just physical but legal, regulatory, monetary,"" he said at a conference late last week. ""Fortunately, that’s changing. 

""There is obviously much more to do: more infrastructure is certainly needed (and) more cohesive and faster regulatory processes. The good news is that this government gets it.""

Consumer prices rose by 3.89 percent in the first half of February compared with the same period a year earlier. That was the lowest level since late December 2016. Compared with the last two weeks of January, prices fell by 0.10 percent. 
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast inflation would stand at 4.07 percent in early February, and that prices would rise 0.12 percent compared with the previous two weeks.
The data, which took inflation to within the central bank's target range for the first time since 2016, showed that a fall in costs for some foodstuffs had helped bring down prices overall during the first half of February.
The central bank targets inflation of 3 percent, with a tolerance threshold of one percentage point above or below.
Economists at Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients that the dip in inflation had strengthened the case for interest rate cuts by the central bank later this year.
Mexican inflation hit its highest level in over 16 years in 2017 following a reduction in gasoline subsidies. Since then, the central bank has raised rates to their highest in over 10 years to try to contain price pressures. 
The data also showed that the closely watched core price index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, climbed by 0.26 percent in early February. The Reuters poll had forecast an increase of 0.25 percent.
Minutes from the central bank's Feb. 7 monetary policy meeting published on Thursday showed the bank's board saw the balance of risks to inflation tilted upward.

Most members of the bank's board also voiced concerns in the meeting that state oil firm Pemex could prove costly for borrowing in Mexico if the financially stretched company suffers a fresh downgrade to its credit rating.

Retail sales fell -0.1% in December from -0.9% in November, Statistics Canada said on Friday. That was largely due to a 3.6% drop in gasoline sales by value, largely a function of lower gas prices. Gasoline sales by volume edged down 0.3%.
Excluding gasoline, retail sales rose by 0.4% on the month. Core retail sales, which excludes automobile sales, fell -0.5%. That follows a downwardly revised -0.7% drop in November.
Cannabis stores registered $151.5 million Canadian dollars in the fourth quarter, following legalization in October 2018. That represents around 0.1% of all retail sales.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone headline consumer inflation slowed slightly in January because of a sharp deceleration of energy price growth, but core inflation watched closely by the European Central Bank in policy decisions edged slightly higher, data showed on Friday.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 1.0 percent month-on-month in January for a 1.4 percent year-on-year rise, in line with previous estimates and market expectations.
Energy prices, which fell 0.9 percent on the month and were 2.7 percent higher than in January 2018, slowed sharply from a 5.5 percent year-on-year growth in December and 9.1 percent increase in November.
Without the volatile components of energy and unprocessed food, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices fell 1.2 percent month-on-month for a 1.2 percent year-on-year increase, accelerating from 1.1 percent in annual terms in December.
Eurostat said the biggest upward push for consumer prices came from services, which contributed 0.7 percentage point to the overall year-on-year result, followed by food, alcohol and tobacco with 0.36 points and energy with 0.26 percentage points. 
European Central Bank policymakers took a gloomy view of the euro zone economy at their last policy meeting and asked for swift preparations for giving banks more long-term loans, minutes of the meeting showed.
With growth unexpectedly weak for the third straight quarter, policymakers are increasingly concerned that global uncertainty is derailing the euro zone's recovery, undoing years of work by the ECB to kickstart the bloc.

Although the ECB just ended a 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme to stimulate growth, it is now preparing the ground for giving more multi-year, cheap loans to banks to ensure they keep credit flowing to the economy even during the slowdown.

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said the consumer price index rose 1.4% in January from the same month a year earlier, down from 1.5% in December. Prices for the month of January fell 1%, from an initial estimate of -1.1%.
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to an annual rate of 1.1% from 1.0% in the previous month, but that is still well below the level targeted by the European Central Bank, which aims for an inflation rate of close to, but just below 2% in the medium term.
The bloc is expected to have another weak first-quarter after data on Thursday showed that manufacturing activity shrank at its fastest pace in six years amid Brexit woes, a slowdown in German exports and political risks in Italy.
The slowdown in the euro zone has led the European Central Bank to consider fresh stimulus measures. The ECB is expected to cut its growth forecasts at its policy meeting in March, and ECB officials have said they expect to discuss issuing a new round of so-called TLTROs - targeted long-term refinancing operations - to help stimulate the economy."

The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of companies, declined to 98.5 this month, its lowest level since November 2014.
The reading was worse than economists’ expectations for 99.0.
The forward-looking element of the index, which measures business's expectations, fell even more sharply to its lowest level since 2012, at the depths of the euro's existential crisis.
Germany's export-driven economy, the motor of the euro zone's, has slowed sharply under the influence of the trade war between the U.S. and China, uncertainty over the U.K.’s departure from the European Union and a threats of higher tariffs on German-made vehicles from U.S. President Donald Trump.
The country’s Federal Statistics Office, Destatis, confirmed earlier Friday that gross domestic product stagnated in the fourth quarter, meaning that the economy narrowly avoided a recession after contracting in the previous three months.
Ifo's survey broadly corroborates others from  IHS Markit and the ZEW  think-tank this week.
Even though ZEW's measure of investor confidence improved to a five-month high, its president Achim Wambach said neither the institute nor the experts it surveyed expect a rapid recovery.
In its latest monthly report, Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, said that recent weak readings in factory orders and a decline in business confidence suggested little hope of an immediate rebound for the euro area’s largest economy.
It predicted that the “underlying pace of the economy should remain subdued at least in the first half of the year”, although it said “there are no signs that the slowdown is becoming an outright downturn.”"

Detailed data released by the Federal Statistics Office confirmed the economy stagnated in the fourth quarter after a contraction in the previous month.
A breakdown of the data showed that state spending had risen by 1.6 percent, contributing 0.3 percentage points to economic growth.
Exports and imports rose by 0.7 percent each on the quarter, resulting in net trade making no contribution.
Private consumption, which has been supporting the economy as exports weaken on trade frictions and bottlenecks in new car registrations, grew by a disappointing 0.2 percent and its contribution to growth was as little as 0.1 percentage points.
VP Bank chief economist Thomas Gitzel said stricter emissions rules that have hindered sales in the automotive sector had weighed on both exports and private consumption.
""We expect a catch-up effect in the current quarter,"" he wrote in a note.
Germany's dependence on exports for growth makes it particularly vulnerable to the trade disputes between the United States and both China and the European Union.
""Where do we go from here? What happens in the international arena will decide the prosperity and adversity of the German economy,"" Gitzel said. ""A resolution to the trade conflict will certainly leave a positive mark.""

95,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 11:31PM ET</span>",Hong Kong's pent-up property demand may herald price rebound,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The outlook for Hong Kong's property market, the world's least affordable, has started to firm with some analysts predicting prices could rise as much as 10 percent this year after only a short-lived correction.
Pent-up demand, expectations of slower interest rate rises and optimism Beijing and Washington will soon hammer out a trade deal, have combined to boost sales after prices drifted lower from mid-2018. Total transaction volumes jumped 120 percent in January to 4,355 sales from 1,963 in December, data from realtor Centaline showed. 
The cooldown, which slowed a decade-long bull run where prices surged more than 200 percent, had raised concerns that a sustained drop would hurt financially-strapped homeowners at a time of rising interest rates and economic uncertainties.
But a rebound in prices means potential buyers will have only a narrow window to get a piece of the city's sky-high real estate, reigniting the challenges policymakers face in easing public discontent over rising costs and asset bubble risks.
Citi, among the most upbeat, sees prices rebounding from March. The brokerage forecasts prices could rise as much as 30 percent in the next two years, with 2019 alone seeing a 5 percent rise.
""There may be black swan events but it shouldn't change the long-term up-cycle...our market is in a serious shortage,"" said Ken Yeung, Citi's head of Hong Kong property research.
Yeung estimated total housing supply at 38,000 units on average per year until the end of 2021, falling short of a demand of 53,000 units per year. 
""Property rebounds have been strong every time in the past because corrections are against the fundamentals,"" he added. ""When a series of negative news happens, many people with real demand, for example the newlyweds, defer their purchases, creating pent-up demand. These demands don't vanish, they accumulate."" 
Hong Kong's private home prices fell for the fifth consecutive month in December, down 2.4 percent from November, official data showed. But prices still climbed 1.6 percent for the whole of 2018.
NEARING BOTTOM?
If shares of local real-estate developers are a precursor of property trends, the Hang Seng's property sub index has surged around 28 percent since October, returning to levels seen in June before Sino-U.S. trade tensions intensified and sparked a market rout.
CLSA also expects the property market to rebound by up to 15 percent from April to the year-end, as capital looks for investment opportunities and pent-up demand from mainland Chinese who are gaining their Hong Kong residency is unleashed this year. 
Developers launching new units at attractive prices, some at 20 percent discount to the secondary market, in the last two months have also been a catalyst to the recovery in transactions. 
Geoffrey Lo, general manager of developer Nan Fung Development, said sales in January were better than expected as activity is usually thin before the Lunar New Year. He added the company could launch more sales this year, depending on market conditions. 
But not everyone is as sanguine that prices are bottoming.
Justin Chiu, an executive director of CK Asset Holdings, a major developer, said he still expected home prices to fall 10 percent this year due to uncertainties from trade tensions and as more homeowners confront negative equity - when a home loan exceeds the market value of the property.
Hong Kong saw its first negative equity cases in two years in the last quarter of 2018, official showed said last month.

But Citi's Yeung brushed off the impact of negative equity on the property market. The number of cases was still very low and the average loan-to-value ratio, the ratio of a loan to asset, was 46 percent in the last two years, an indication most homebuyers were strong enough to withstand a price correction.

ZHENGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Growth in China's new home prices eased slightly in January from December, in initial signs the property market is cooling as the economy slows, but price gains in annual terms accelerated.
Weaker economic momentum and the government's drive to dampen speculation have hurt buyer sentiment but price growth has stayed relatively resilient as policymakers avoid triggering financial risks with a sharp slowdown in the key sector.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.6 percent in January, the weakest pace since April 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday. 
That was slower than December's 0.8 percent monthly growth but marked 45 straight months of price increases, Reuters calculations showed. 
Still, on an annual basis, home prices increased 10 percent in January, accelerating from a 9.7 percent pace in December. Fifty-eight of the total 70 cities surveyed by the NBS reported higher prices in January, down from 59 in December. 
China's economy grew at its weakest pace in 28 years last year due to trade frictions and Beijing's multi-year campaign to crack down on debt risks, weighing on consumer sentiment and the outlook for the country's residential property market. 
Some smaller cities have quietly loosened property policies to stabilize market sentiment. In December, Heze, a city in eastern China, reversed a rule designed to curb real estate flipping. 
Price growth in China's tier-1 cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou - rose 0.4 percent from a month earlier, compared with an increase of 1.3 percent in December, the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. 
For tier-2 provincial capitals and smaller tier-3 cities, the official survey showed monthly price gains of 0.7 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. 
China's biggest developer by sales, Country Garden, China Vanke and China Evergrande all posted lower contract sales in January compared with a year earlier. 
New household loans, mostly mortgages, increased by 989.8 billion yuan in January, accounting for 30.6 percent of total new loans in January, central bank data showed last week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation accelerated slightly in January but remained distant from the central bank's 2 percent target, reinforcing market expectations the country is nowhere near an exit from ultra-loose monetary policy.
The price data underscores the fragile nature of Japan's economic recovery, as escalating Sino-U.S. trade frictions and slowing Chinese growth weigh on exports and business sentiment.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.8 percent in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
It matched a median market forecast and accelerated slightly from a 0.7 percent rise in December, the data showed.
An index the BOJ focuses on - the so-called core-core CPI that strips away the effect of both volatile food and energy costs - rose 0.4 percent in January, ticking up from the previous month's 0.3 percent gain.
The increase was driven by a rise in service inflation, which may be a sign firms are passing on rising wage costs, said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""We expect the labor market to remain tight over the coming year so service inflation may strengthen a little further. Even so, falling energy prices mean that inflation will slow from 1.0 percent in 2018 to around 0.5 percent this year,"" he said.
The BOJ faces a dilemma. Years of heavy money printing have dried up market liquidity and hurt commercial banks' profits, stoking concerns over the rising risks of prolonged easing.
And yet, subdued inflation has left the BOJ well behind its U.S. and European counterparts in dialing back crisis-mode policies, and with a dearth of ammunition to battle an abrupt yen spike that could derail an export-driven economic recovery.
Some analysts say core consumer inflation may grind to a halt in coming months as recent oil price falls push down gas and electricity bills, which could put the Bank of Japan under pressure to ramp up an already massive stimulus program.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday the central bank was ready to expand monetary stimulus if sharp yen rises hurt Japan's economic recovery.
But he also said the BOJ will look not just at the benefits but the costs of additional easing, signaling that the hurdle for topping up stimulus would be high.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 12:57PM ET</span>",Weak U.S. data underscore growing headwinds to economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in December amid declining demand for machinery and primary metals, pointing to a sustained slowdown in business spending on equipment that could further crimp economic growth.
The economy's outlook was also dimmed by other reports on Thursday showing a measure of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted in February for the first time since May 2016 and home resales plunging to a more than three-year low in January. 
The reports, together with data last week showing steep declines in retail sales in December and manufacturing output in January, strengthen the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" stance toward raising interest rates further this year.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Jan. 29-30 policy meeting published on Wednesday noted that ""some risks to the downside had increased"" with regard to the outlook for the economy. The Fed left interest rates unchanged at that meeting and discarded promises of ""further gradual increases"" in borrowing costs.
""It appears the bloom is off the economic expansion rose,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The data don't paint a picture of strong growth going forward.""
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.7 percent. Data for November was revised down to show these so-called core capital goods orders falling 1.0 percent instead of declining 0.6 percent as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.2 percent in December. Core capital goods orders increased 6.1 percent on a year-on-year basis. 
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.5 percent in December after an unrevised 0.2 percent drop in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
While the rebound in core capital goods shipments suggests continued moderate growth in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter, the surprise drop in orders points to weakness in the months ahead. 
The December report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. The Commerce Department said the ""processing and data quality were monitored throughout, and response and coverage rates were at or above normal levels for this release.""
The dollar trimmed gains versus a basket of currencies on the data and stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
DARKENING CLOUDS
The softening business spending outlook was highlighted by a another report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showing its manufacturing activity index dropped to a reading of -4.1 this month from 17.0 in January. That was the first negative reading since May 2016. 
A reading below zero indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing sector. However, manufacturers in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware remained generally upbeat about business conditions over the next six months.
Business spending on equipment has been slowing since the second quarter of 2018, despite the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut. Some companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale. A survey last month showed lower taxes had not caused companies to change hiring or investment plans.
There was more bad news from the housing market, which has lagged other sectors. In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales dropped 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.94 million units last month, the lowest level since November 2015.
But prospects for the housing market are improving, with mortgage rates declining to a one-year low and house price inflation slowing, which could make home buying more appealing. For now, the weak housing market is more evidence that the economy struggled early in 2019 after hitting a soft patch in the fourth quarter.
""But the bigger picture is that a slowing economy, as well as the continued problem of a lack of inventory, will keep a lid on sales growth this year,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
A fourth report from the Conference Board showed a measure of future U.S. economic activity slipped in January after being unchanged in December amid predictions of a considerable deceleration in growth by the end of 2019. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) trimmed its GDP growth estimate for the fourth quarter of 2018 by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.4 percent rate. The government will publish the fourth-quarter GDP report next Thursday. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
The economy's outlook has been clouded by fears of a sharp slowdown in global growth, especially in China and Europe, fading fiscal stimulus, trade tensions as well as uncertainty regarding Britain's departure from the European Union.
Despite the darkening clouds, the labor market remains strong, though the trend in layoffs has been indicating some weakness. In a fifth report on Thursday, the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended Feb. 16. 
But the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,000 to 235,750 last week, the highest level since January 2018.

""It looks like the labor market has cooled lately, and this is not too surprising given that job growth has been robust in recent months despite other signs that the economy has slowed,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales fall sharply to three-year low,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell in January to their lowest level in more than three years and house prices rose only modestly, suggesting a further loss of momentum in the housing market. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday existing home sales dropped 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.94 million units last month. 
That was the lowest level since November 2015 and well below analysts' expectations of a rate of 5.0 million units. December's sales pace was revised slightly higher. 
The drop in January came after months of weakness in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales were down 8.5 percent from a year ago. 
The U.S. housing market has been stymied by a sharp rise in mortgage rates since 2016 as well as land and labor shortages. That has led to tight inventory and more expensive homes. 
At the same time, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dipped in recent months and house price inflation is slowing.
The median existing house price increased 2.8 percent from a year ago to $247,500 in January. That was the smallest increase since February 2012.
Last month, existing home sales fell in three of the country's four major regions, rising only in the Northeast.
There were 1.59 million previously owned homes on the market in January, up from 1.53 million in December.

At January's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 3.7 months in December. A supply of six to seven months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Existing home sales fell 1.2% in January from the previous month to an annualized pace of 4.94 million units, according to NAR figures released on Thursday.
After hitting their lowest level since November 2015, NAR’s chief economist Lawrence Yun said that sales likely hit a bottom in January. Inventories of unsold houses rose for the sixth straight month to 1.59 million, from 1.53 million in December
“Existing home sales in January were weak compared to historical norms; however, they are likely to have reached a cyclical low,” he said.
The NAR acknowledged that affordability in the real estate market - and a lack of lower-priced housing in general - remained a problem. But it said it expects affordability to improve in the course of the year. 
One reason for that may be that mortgage rates have started to decline again as the Federal Reserve has suspended its policy of official rate hikes. The NAR cited Freddie Mac data showing that the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.46 percent in January from 4.64 percent in December. 
“Moderating home prices combined with gains in household income will boost housing affordability, bringing more buyers to the market in the coming months,” Yun predicted."

The regional central bank said its business activity index deteriorated to -4.1 from 17.0 in January. The negative reading was well below economists' forecast of 14.0, according to a Reuters poll. The decrease was the biggest monthly drop since August 2011.
""Manufacturing conditions in the region weakened this month,"" the Philadelphia Fed said on the latest data.
Any reading below zero indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing sector.
The Philadelphia Fed's survey covers the manufacturing industries in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
The survey's component on news orders declined to -2.4, the lowest figure since May 2016, from 21.3 in January.
The monthly drop in regional new orders activity was the steepest since October 2008 during the height of the global credit crisis.
Mid-Atlantic shipment activity also sank into negative territory to -5.3 from 11.4 the month before.
On the other hand, the survey's employment barometer rose to 14.5 from 9.6.

Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions and below indicates worsening conditions.
The Philly Fed noted that indicators for new orders and shipments also fell into negative territory, although the subindex for employment remained positive.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended Feb. 16, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
But the Labor Department said claims for California, Virginia, Hawaii and Puerto Rico were estimated last week because of Monday's Presidents' Day Holiday. That could have exaggerated the drop in claims.

Durable-goods orders increased 1.2% last month, the Commerce Department said. Economists had forecast a 0.8% rise.

Comments in the last week from senior officials have indicated that the bank is already making preparations for fresh stimulus in the form of long-term loans to banks, known as TLTROs. They illustrate how quickly sentiment at the central bank has changed after a barrage of data showing a sharp slowdown in Germany and Italy, two of the bloc’s biggest economies, at the end of last year.
“While any decisions in this respect should not be taken too hastily, the technical analyses required to prepare policy options for future liquidity operations needed to proceed swiftly,” the minutes noted.
Even so, the minutes sounded too relaxed for some. 
""The discussion on new monetary policy measures has not even really started yet,"" Nordea Markets economist Jan van Gerich said in a blog post. ""The recent data releases, however, give clear grounds to being more worried.""
The bank had left all its official interest rates unchanged at the meeting, and President Mario Draghi – who is due to step down later this year – subsequently repeated its previous guidance leaving open the possibility of a rate hike after the summer.
Policymakers noted that the risks surrounding the euro-area growth outlook had moved to the downside “on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility”.
European banks are due to repay about €720 billion ($815.6 billion) when previous TLTROs mature in mid-2020.
Since the meeting, policymakers have taken an increasingly dovish view of developments, given additional signs of economic weakness. Business surveys released Thursday by IHS Markit suggested that the euro zone's economy will grow by only 0.1% in the first quarter.
ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said last Friday that policymakers were discussing the possibility of offering new targeted long-term loans to banks, known as TLTROs, something that would help to stop market interest rates for euros rising for the next couple of years.
And in an interview published on Sunday by Spanish newspaper El País, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau noted that the central bank’s course of action would depend on whether the current slowdown is temporary, or appears to be a longer-term threat.
He indicated that resilient domestic demand in Germany, France and Spain was so far keeping the threat of a recession at bay although he recognized the risks of worldwide protectionism and the uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s departure from the European Union.
The next ECB policy meeting will take place on March 7, where policymakers are expected to cut growth and inflation forecasts, in the light of recent data.
Overall, the minutes were largely in line with Draghi’s message at the Jan. 24 press conference and little movement was seen in currency and debt markets after the publication."
108,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 04:41AM ET</span>",UK public finances hit record monthly surplus due to strong income tax revenue,"Britain's public finances showed a record surplus last month as a surge in income tax payments put finance minister Philip Hammond on a strong footing for his final fiscal statement before Brexit.
Britain ran a budget surplus of 14.895 billion pounds in January, the highest since monthly records began in 1993 and above all economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Thursday.
Britain's budget deficit now looks on track to fall to its lowest since 2001/02 at just over 1 percent of national income this financial year, down from nearly 10 percent just after the depths of the global banking crisis in 2009/10.
January is typically a surplus month for Britain's public coffers because of seasonal flows of income tax, and the latest data showed income and capital gains tax receipts up 14 percent, twice their average growth rate earlier in the year.
Borrowing in the first 10 months of the financial year came to 21.2 billion pounds, 47 percent less than at the same point in the 2017/18 tax year and the lowest since the 10 months to January 2001. 
For the full year, the government aims to limit borrowing to 25.5 billion pounds, 39 percent less than in 2017/18.
Hammond will give a half-yearly budget update to parliament on March 13, just over two weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union.
But government budget forecasters predict borrowing will rise during the financial year starting in April as the economy slows and the government faces pressure to increase real-terms spending on areas such as public health.
A disruptive no-deal Brexit would be likely to hurt tax revenues further and boost the need for public spending.
Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to win parliament's support for the deal she brokered with Brussels last year. Without a Brexit deal, British importers and exporters face the risk of lengthy customs delays.
Hammond has said he has set aside money to help the economy if it suffers a Brexit shock.
The ONS said Thursday's data showed strong increases for tax revenue on income and capital gains, and also for taxes on corporate profits, a smaller source of government revenue.
However, property transaction tax revenue fell, reflecting a slowing housing market.
Stripping out investment spending, Britain is already running a budget surplus. But lawmakers criticized Hammond earlier this month for appearing to have abandoned an aim to run an outright budget surplus by the middle of the next decade.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>","Euro zone February factory activity declined, overall growth scant: PMI","Euro zone factory output unexpectedly slammed into reverse last month as activity in Europe's manufacturing powerhouse Germany declined again amid trade tensions and struggles in the auto sector, surveys showed.
While that downturn was offset by a much faster than expected acceleration in services activity - which meant overall private sector growth picked up modestly - it will likely worry policymakers as factories also drive the bloc's dominant service industry.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, which is seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 51.4 this month from a final January reading of 51.0, above a Reuters poll median expectation for 51.1 but still below where it has been for much of the past four years.
""The euro zone economy remained close to stagnation in February. The general picture remained one of a more subdued business environment than seen throughout much of last year,"" Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist said.
Williamson said the results pointed to first-quarter euro zone growth of just 0.1 percent, below the latest Reuters poll estimate for 0.4 percent. They come soon after the European Central Bank ended its more than 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase stimulus programme. 
The flash manufacturing PMI tumbled to 49.2 this month, its lowest since mid-2013 and substantially below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.
A Reuters poll had predicted a modest dip to 50.3 from January's final reading of 50.5. The lowest forecast in the poll of 38 economists was 49.6.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI, dropped to 49.2 from 50.5, its lowest reading since May 2013. In a further sign of how manufacturers are struggling, the new orders index fell to a near six-year low of 46.2 from 47.8.
Adding to that gloomy picture, factories ran down old orders faster while also building up a stock of completed products.
Germany's vast manufacturing sector contracted for a second month, only weeks before Britain, Europe's second-largest economy, is due to leave the European Union and as uncertainty around the U.S.-China trade war continued and new pollution standards are still affecting car makers.
""The weakness is being led by manufacturing. With factory order books deteriorating at an increased rate, the rate of contraction in the goods-producing sector will likely worsen in coming months,"" Williamson said.
In contrast, demand for services across the currency union picked up and firms were able to build up a backlog of work, so a PMI for the services industry jumped to 52.3 from 51.2, above a Reuters poll consensus for 51.4.
That helped optimism rise, with the business expectations index bouncing to a four-month high of 61.6 from 60.5 and firms taking on new workers at a faster rate.
Yet with overall demand falling and backlogs diminishing firms had to curtail by how much they raised prices. The output prices index fell to an 18-month low of 52.5 from 53.4.
With January inflation across the bloc expected to be confirmed at 1.4 percent when official figures are released on Friday, well below the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling, a decline in inflationary pressure will also concern ECB policymakers.

The development in both sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy meant that IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a four-month high of 52.7 from 52.1 the previous month.
The index measuring activity in the manufacturing sector fell to a 74-month low of 47.6, staying below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction for the second month in a row.
Activity in services rose to a five-month high of 55.1, up from 53.0 in January.
""While strong fundamentals in the domestic market are driving growth in services business activity, falling exports continue to weigh on the performance of the manufacturing sector,"" said Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit.
""Measured overall, the data remain indicative of a very modest rate of underlying output growth.""
Germany's exporters are facing headwinds from trade disputes between the United States and both China and the European Union. The prospect of Britain leaving the European Union next month without a deal is also dampening the business outlook.
The manufacturing sector has also been hit by stricter emission standards that have created bottlenecks in new car registrations as well as low rainfall in the Rhine region, which has hindered chemicals deliveries through waterways.
All this has translated into a slowdown in Europe's biggest economy, which registered it weakest growth rate in five years last year.
The economy has been relying on consumption for growth. A robust labor market, rising wages and low interest rates have been supporting the consumption-driven cycle.
The strength of the labour market was reflected in the PMI survey, which showed the rate of job creation in the manufacturing sector was robust despite the contraction.
""The strength in employment is perhaps surprising given the order book situation and lack of pressures on capacity, but goods producers are seemingly looking through the current soft patch in demand,"" said Smith.

112,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 03:32AM ET</span>",Services Rescue German Private Sector Activity in February,"Investing.com - German private-sector activity picked up in February, according to data released on Thursday, as buoyant services compensated for a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector, traditionally the euro-zone economy's most powerful growth engine. 
The preliminary reading of the IHS Markit composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, advanced to a four-month high of 52.7 from 52.1, ahead of expectations for 52.0.
The services PMI rose to a five-month peak of 55.1, ahead of expectations for 52.9 and up from 53.0 a month earlier. 
However, the manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest in more than six years at 47.6, from 49.7 in January. Economists had expected a reading of 50.0, the level that notionally separates expansion from contraction.
“Germany’s manufacturing and service sectors remain on very different paths,"" said Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit. ""While strong fundamentals in the domestic market are driving growth in services business activity, falling exports continue to weigh on the performance of the manufacturing sector,"" he added.
The data come after the German economy stagnated in the fourth quarter, after contracting in the three months through September.
In its latest monthly report, Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, said that recent weak readings in factory orders and a decline in business confidence suggested little hope of an immediate rebound for the euro area’s largest economy.
It predicted that the “underlying pace of the economy should remain subdued at least in the first half of the year”, although it said “there are no signs that the slowdown is becoming an outright downturn.”

113,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 03:15AM ET</span>",French Private-Sector Output Stabilizes in February,"Investing.com - French private-sector activity stabilized in February after successive contractions in the previous two months, a report showed on Thursday.
The preliminary reading of the IHS Markit composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, rose to a three-month high of 49.9, from 48.2 in January. Economists had forecast a reading of 49.0.
“February flash data pointed to a broad stabilisation in output...offering relatively positive news after the weak performances of December and January,"" said Eliot Kerr, an economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
“Although the ‘gilets jaunes’ protests are still ongoing and panellists have suggested that these are still causing disruption, the economy showed resilience in the latest survey period,"" Kerr added. ""Encouragingly, the rate of job creation accelerated and new orders declined only marginally, arresting the downward momentumseen over the past couple of months,"" 
Service providers reported only a fractional decline in business activity, the report said, while manufacturers saw production broadly stabilize.
Companies reported adding new staff at a quicker pace in February, with job creation rising faster in the service sector. 
Companies remained optimistic towards the business outlook. The level of confidence was broadly in line with January, despite a slight fall in sentiment among manufacturers.
The services PMI climbed to a three-month high, ticking up to 49.8 from 47.8 in January, which was the sharpest contraction in over four years.
The manufacturing PMI hit the highest level in five months, hitting 51.4 up from 51.2 in January and ahead of expectations for a reading of 51.0.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's jobs growth surged past all expectations in January as firms took on more full-time staff while the jobless rate stayed at its lowest in seven years, barnstorming performance that will boost policymakers confidence in the economy.
A total 39,100 net new jobs were created in January, from a downwardly revised but still sturdy 16,900 in December and surpassing market forecasts for a 15,000 increase, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) report on Thursday.
The Australian dollar briefly jumped to a two-week top of $0.7208 and the futures market pared chances of a rate cut later this year.
The rally soon ended after Westpac Banking Corp became Australia's first major lender to predict cuts in the official cash rate later this year, citing slowing economic growth and lukewarm inflation.
Westpac chief economist Bill Evans, however, did point to January's strong labor market outcome as a risk to his rate outlook.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has held rates at a record low 1.50 percent for 2-1/2 years, is counting on labor market strength for a long-awaited pick up in wage growth and inflation in the face of a downturn in the property market.
In recent public comments, RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle underlined the importance of the labor market for the economy. 
""The main thing is to not lose your job,"" Debelle said. ""I say that in all seriousness.""
""Our main job is to make sure that the economy continues at a reasonable pace, with a low level of unemployment,"" he added. ""That's going to be the thing which allows most people out there, who've got a mortgage, to continue to handle that mortgage.""
So far, the labor market is sticking to the RBA's script with annual employment growth of 2.2 percent faster than the 1.6 percent rise in population.
The unemployment rate is at a 7-1/2-year trough of 5.0 percent. The only factor preventing a further decline in January was a rise in the participation rate to 65.7 percent. This means unemployment was steady even with an increase in the number of people looking for work.
A Reuters poll this week showed a median of 28 economists predicted rates at 1.50 percent through early 2021, a view that would find some support in Thursday's numbers. 
""The latest data means that the Reserve Bank stays on the interest rate sidelines for an extended period,"" CommSec chief economist Craig James said. 
""A strong job market, combined with generational lows in interest rates, reduces the prospect of a broader economic slowdown caused by fall in Sydney and Melbourne home prices."" 
Helping that confidence, leading indicators of labor demand continue to point to further employment growth in Australia in a positive sign for household spending. 
An index of vacancies released by the department of jobs and small business last month showed there were 185,547 skilled job vacancies in December, the highest in 6-1/2 years.

115,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",Japanese Manufacturing Contracts for the First Time Since 2016,"(Bloomberg) -- Activity in Japan’s manufacturing sector contracted in February for the first time in two and a half years, as production and new orders fell, according to preliminary data that will strengthen concerns about a global economic slowdown.
The Nikkei Japan Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturers declined to 48.5, its lowest reading since June 2016. It follows trade data on Tuesday that showed a worse-than-expected fall in Japanese exports in January.
A reading of 50 marks the point between an expansion and a contraction of activity. The subindex for production fell to 47.0 from 49.4, meaning actual output declined further.
""Although the initial Q4 estimate revealed a bounce back in economic activity, the PMI suggests underlying business conditions are unfavorable,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. “Unless service sector activity can offset manufacturing weakness, the chance of Japan entering a recession in 2019 looks set to rise.”
The headline figure illustrates how the economic outlook has changed for the worse. A year ago, the data showed Japanese manufacturing activity at its strongest in nearly four years.
"
116,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 08:24PM ET</span>",Japan February manufacturing shrinks for first time since 2016 amid trade war-flash PMI,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity contracted in February for the first time in two-and-a-half years as factories cut back output amid shrinking domestic and export orders, a private business survey showed on Thursday.
The survey also showed business confidence in Japan soured for the first time in more than six years, highlighting the growing toll that the U.S.-China trade war is inflicting on Asia's export-reliant economies and global manufacturing.
The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 48.5 in February from a final 50.3 in January.
The index fell below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since August 2016.
The pessimistic turn in business sentiment ""comes as no surprise given the international headwinds Japanese manufacturers are facing such as a China slowdown and the global trade cycle losing further steam,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Unless service sector activity can recover from January's decline, the chance of Japan entering a recession in 2019 looks set to rise."" 
The output component of the flash PMI index fell to a preliminary 47.0 from a final 54.4 in January to show the fastest contraction since May 2016.
Indicators of future activity were equally grim.
Total new orders - domestic and foreign - pointed to a sharper decline in demand than the previous month. Though export orders contracted at a slightly slower pace, it is unlikely to ease doubts about the outlook for overseas demand.
Companies also reduced their purchases of raw materials and other inputs for the second month running. 
The PMI survey comes one day after government data showed Japan's exports fell the most in more than two years in January as China-bound shipments tumbled.
Global trade has slowed over the past year as Washington and Beijing ramped up tariffs on each others' goods, disrupting supply chains worldwide. At the same time, economic activity has been weakening noticeably in China and Europe.
Japan could face further weakness if the United States and China do not quickly resolve their differences over trade, some economists say.
Negotiators from both sides are racing to beat a March 1 deadline for a deal, though U.S. President Donald Trump has said that could be extended if an agreement appeared close.

Japan's economy bounced back in the fourth quarter as business and consumer spending recovered from the impact of natural disasters, but trade frictions and a proposed sales tax hike are expected to hinder growth this year.

117,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>","Fed Eyes End to Balance Sheet Unwind Later This Year, Minutes Show","Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers expressed a willingness to end their balance sheet unwinding program later this year and keep rate hikes on hold to get a better sense of the health of U.S. economy and the extent of deteriorating global growth, minutes published Wednesday showed.
The Fed kept its benchmark rate in a range of 2.25% to 2.5% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Jan. 30.
""Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings later this year,"" the minutes showed.
The Fed has been allowing as much as $50 billion a month of maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet, which peaked at roughly $4.5 trillion in Jan. 2015, but has now narrowed to about $4 trillion.
The minutes also showed that central bank was willing to keep rate hikes on pause amid expectations for a slower pace of U.S. economic growth.
""Several several participants commented that they had nudged down their outlooks for output growth since the December meeting, citing a softening in consumer or business sentiment, a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth, or the tightening in financial conditions that had occurred in recent months.""
""Participants noted that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks at this point. The current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate.""
At its previous meeting in January, the Fed ditched its usual reference to ""gradual"" rate hikes included in its policy statement, fueling expectations the central bank may not raise rates at all this year.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, traders believe there's little chance the Fed will hike rates this year, with the odds now more in favor of a rate cut rather than a rate hike.
The Fed attempted to shed some light on the apparent change in its approach to monetary policy, citing both domestic and foreign headwinds, including the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China.
""With regard to the domestic economic picture, additional data would help policymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment, whether the recent softness in core and total inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on aggregate demand,"" the minutes showed.
""Furthermore, a patient posture would allow time for a clearer picture of the international trade policy situation and the state of the global economy to emerge and, in particular, could allow policymakers to reach a firmer judgment about the extent and persistence of the economic slowdown in Europe and China.""
Allianz (DE:ALVG) Chief Economic Adviser, Mohamed A. El-Erian highlighted four takeaways from the minutes that explained the Fed's policy shift in January.



In the run-up to the release of the minutes, Federal Reserve members reiterated the central bank should continue to adopt a wait-and-see approach amid a slew of negative reports on retail sales, manufacturing and services activity.
""Monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve,"" Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester on Tuesday. ""This environment gives us the opportunity to continue to gather information on the economy."""
118,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 11:04AM ET</span>",Sudan's economic decline provides fuel for anger against Bashir,"By Patrick Werr and Khalid Abdelaziz
KHARTOUM (Reuters) - As Samir Gasim reels off the problems facing his Khartoum confectionery and packaging factories, already running well below capacity, the power cuts and generators kick in. 
Now he fears the plants may close entirely due to a sudden, eightfold hike in industrial diesel prices imposed by a government desperately short of foreign currency and facing the biggest popular protests since President Omar al-Bashir came to power 30 years ago.
""We are in favor of eliminating subsidies, but gradually, over five years. Not overnight,"" said Gasim, seated in his spartan factory office. ""Otherwise it will be a disaster.""
Sudan's worsening economic crisis has caused fuel, cash and bread shortages that in turn set off a wave of unrest that has surged across the country over the past two months. 
The economic slide has also alienated the professional classes, who blame Bashir and the ruling National Congress Party for their troubles, according to businessmen, activists and academics. That has undermined Bashir's authority and encouraged a protest movement that has persisted despite a security crackdown in which dozens have died.
The Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA), which has posted calls for protests on social media and organized strikes, draws in doctors, teachers and lawyers and others complaining of decades of economic mismanagement and isolation.
Founded in 2015, it was planning to submit a request to parliament to raise the base level from which monthly public sector salaries are calculated of 650 Sudanese pounds - now worth just $13.60 at the official exchange rate - on Dec. 25, six days after protests began to escalate.
""We decided to raise the ceiling of our demands from the improvement of wages and the working environment and the right to form professional unions, to demanding the end of the regime,"" said Mohamed Yousef, an SPA spokesman and economics professor at Khartoum University.
""There was a big response to us because there is an economic crisis and failure of government, and fuel, bread and liquidity crises."" 
INFILTRATORS
Officials have blamed the unrest on unnamed infiltrators and on Sudan's international isolation, saying they are taking steps to address the economic turmoil. Bankers say U.S. sanctions, though reduced, have choked the economy. 
Bashir, subject of an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Darfur and hoping for a financial lifeline from the International Monetary Fund, has tried to be measured in his response to burnish his international image, diplomats say. He has tempered warnings to protesters with expressions of sympathy for their plight. 
But protests in Khartoum and other cities have continued almost daily, with demonstrators calling for an end to what they see as Bashir's kleptocratic and incompetent rule. Popular chants include ""Down, that's it!"" and ""Peaceful, peaceful against the thieves"".
In a country where more than half the population of 42 million are under the age of 19, many of the protesters are young men and women struggling to find jobs that could pay them a living wage. Unemployment rose from 12 percent in 2011 to around 20 percent in recent years, with youth unemployment at more than 27 percent, according to IMF and World Bank estimates.
Businessmen say an unskilled factory worker in Khartoum earns from 1,000 to 1,500 pounds ($18 to $27) a month and a skilled worker may make double that, barely enough for a family to survive. 
Some families in the capital have pulled their children out of school over the last year or are serving them fewer and less nutritious meals, making them more susceptible to disease, according to a government presentation to social workers last month in Khartoum.
The economic crisis has hit salaried staff, young people and the unemployed particularly hard. Families have had to sell scarce belongings and crime has risen, the presentation said.
Since the protests began the government has been spending even more money on largely imported, subsidized products including bread and fuel. But it has all but run out of the foreign currency it needs to pay for them, causing widespread shortages.
DEBTS
Sudan already has foreign debts of more than $50 billion, and has been struggling to attract new external financing. By the end of 2018, inflation was running at more than 70 percent. It then dipped to 43 percent, according to official figures, though one U.S.-based economist put it at nearly double that. [nL5N2064VK] 
Authorities will likely continue to expand the money supply, exacerbating inflation, bankers and economists say.
It was a short-lived attempt to increase the price of bread to ease a shortage that sparked the current unrest. Raising the price of diesel for industry but not other consumers will cause yet more problems, warned Abbas Ali Elsayed, Secretary General of the Sudanese Chambers of Industry.
""This will lead to lots of corruption. People will start selling to factories on the black market. It will affect the competitiveness of factories,"" he said. 
Higher diesel prices will spread rapidly through the economy as the cost of running farm machinery, transport and industry surges, analysts say. They also risk crushing Sudan's struggling manufacturers. 
Factory owner Gasim had been investing to add chocolate bars and potato chips to the foodstuffs already produced in one of his plants. Diesel shortages, power failures and falling demand from consumers who can't afford his products mean he has slashed output and shed workers instead. 
Late last month, his suppliers told him the government had increased the diesel price for industry to 222 Sudanese pounds per imperial gallon from 28 pounds. 
""We will have to close the factory completely if the price doesn't go back down,"" he said.
The 240 people he employs at the factory and a nearby cardboard packaging plant, and more than 100 seasonal staff, could be out of work.
Some older Sudanese remember different times before Bashir came to power in a coup in 1989.
Sudan's major cities had 65 cinemas, many privately run, before Islamist governments under Bashir with a ""hostile"" attitude to the arts shut them all down, says film director Suleiman Ahmed Ibrahim. 
""This is a part of modern life that young people in Sudan have lost, and could be one of the reasons they complain about the political system,"" he said.
At universities, quality has fallen and many academics have gone overseas, while an emphasis on Islamic education has led to ""the neglect of mathematics, science and arts"", said Ali Mohamed Othman, a 69-year-old professor at the Sudan University of Science and Technology. 
University staff, like other members of the middle class, used to be able to get by on part of their salary. Now it only lasts a few days every month.

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted gauge of loan requests to buy a home and to refinance one rose 3.6 percent to 365.3 in the week ended Feb. 15. The prior week's reading was the lowest in a month.
""Mortgage rates held steady on mixed economic news, as core inflation remained firm, while retail sales in December were much weaker than expected. However, overall application activity picked up over the week,” Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of industry surveys and forecasts, said in a statement.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $484,350 or less ticked up to 4.66 percent from the prior week's 4.65 percent, which was the lowest since March 2, 2018.
U.S. Treasury yields, which are benchmarks for most mortgages, rose last week as underlying inflation trends remained intact and traders reduced their safe-haven bond holdings on optimism that China and the United States would resolve their trade conflict.
The other mortgage rates that MBA tracks were unchanged to 8 basis points higher on the week.
""Most rates remained close to 10-month lows, which allowed some borrowers with an incentive to refinance to capitalize,"" Kan said.
The group's seasonally adjusted barometer on home refinancing requests rose 6.4 percent to 1,084.4.
The refinance share of total mortgage applications was 41.7 percent last week, compared with 41.8 percent the prior week.

MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on applications to buy a home, which is seen as a proxy on future housing activity, climbed 1.7 percent at 232.7 last week.

Although the CBI warned that Brexit talks were rapidly approaching ""crisis point"", its data painted a more positive picture ahead of Brexit than many recent surveys of the sector.
Official data last week showed the sector contracted by the biggest amount in in over five years during the final three month of 2018. 
The CBI's factory order book balance rose to +6 this month from January's reading of -1, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and above the survey's long-run average.
Export order growth also strengthened, though manufacturers expected output growth to slow over the next three months from the above-average rates predicted in December and January.
""UK manufacturing activity has moderated at the same time as headwinds from Brexit uncertainty and a weaker global trading environment have grown,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
Britain's main manufacturing body, Make UK, warned on Tuesday that a no-deal Brexit next month would be a ""catastrophic prospect"" for the sector.
Finance minister Philip Hammond told Make UK's annual dinner that lawmakers and EU leaders needed to listen to industry.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Slackening international demand for German goods and its car industry's difficulties meeting new emissions standards have led to the share of manufacturing in Germany's economic value creation falling in 2018 for the first time since 2013.
Numbers from the German statistical office reviewed by Reuters highlight the challenge Economy Minister Peter Altmaier faces if he is to succeed in his goal of raising the industry share of gross value added to 25 percent by 2030.
The share fell to 23.2 percent in 2018, from 23.4 percent the previous year.
Germany, whose advanced manufacturing sector has fueled a decade-long boom in Europe's largest economy, also faces a stiff challenge from Chinese manufacturers and from Silicon Valley, which have advantages in emerging digital technologies where Germany has less of a tradition.
Other temporary factors contributing to the poor results included low water levels on the Rhine river, a major shipping artery, which caused supply chains to snag, triggering an industry recession in the second half of 2018.

Industry is especially important for Germany, whose export-oriented economy is especially dependent on its commanding lead in the export of high-value engineering goods to the wider world.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports posted their biggest decline in more than two years as China-bound shipments tumbled, fuelling concerns about slowing global demand as the business mood sours and orders for the country's machinery goods fell sharply.
Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed Japan's exports fell 8.4 percent year-on-year in January, a bigger decline than the 5.5 percent fall expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
It was the sharpest annual decline since October 2016, and followed a revised 3.9 percent year-on-year drop last December.
The data came after a key gauge of Japanese capital spending showed overseas orders for machinery fell the most in more than a decade in December, and business sentiment soured to a two-year low, as trade friction and slowing Chinese growth bite.
Japanese exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, fell 17.4 percent year-on-year.
While the Lunar New Year holiday weighed on China-bound exports, analysts say there are more concerning drivers behind January's decline. In contrast, exports to China rose 30 percent year-on-year in January 2018.
""You cannot solely blame it on Chinese New Year holidays as China's slowdown becomes more evident as a trend, which is having ripple effects on slowing Japanese shipments elsewhere such as Asia and Europe,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""As China's slowdown and its trade war with the United States cause global trade and the world economy to stall, Japan cannot count on exports to drive growth this year,"" he said.
Global trade has slowed as Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle for months, which could have ripple effects on Japan's export-focused economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks with China in Washington this week were progressing well and suggested he was open to pushing back the deadline to complete negotiations, but provided few details.
Japan's shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of overall exports, fell 13.1 percent in January, dragged by China-bound steel flat rolls and South Korea-bound exports of semiconductor production equipment, the trade data showed.
Japan's exports to the European Union fell 2.5 percent in January year-on-year, down for the first time in four months. 
U.S. TARIFF THREAT
U.S.-bound exports rose 6.8 percent, led by shipments of cars, which helped push Japan's trade surplus with the United States up 5.1 percent to 367.4 billion yen ($3.32 billion), its first increase in seven months.
Japan's imports from the United States rose 7.7 percent in the year to January, led by crude oil.
The increases in U.S.-bound exports and Japan's surplus with the country raise concerns among Japanese policymakers and auto exporters that Washington may impose hefty duties on its imports from trading partners, analysts say. 
The U.S. Commerce Department sent a report on Sunday to U.S. President Donald Trump that could unleash steep tariffs on imported cars and auto parts.
Imports of Japanese cars make up about two-thirds of Japan's $69 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, making Tokyo and Beijing targets of criticism by Trump.
In January, U.S.-bound auto shipments grew 23.2 percent in January to 139,579 units, the trade data showed.
Japan's overall imports fell 0.6 percent year-on-year, a smaller decline than the median estimate for a 2.8 percent decrease.

The trade balance came to a deficit of 1.4152 trillion yen, versus a 1.011 trillion yen shortfall seen by economists.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A quarterly leading indicator of world merchandise trade slumped to its lowest reading in nine years on Tuesday, which should put policymakers on guard for a sharper slowdown if trade tensions continue, the World Trade Organization said on Tuesday.
The WTO's quarterly outlook indicator, a composite of seven drivers of trade, showed a reading of 96.3, the weakest since March 2010 and down from 98.6 in November. A reading below 100 signals below-trend growth in trade.
""This sustained loss of momentum highlights the urgency of reducing trade tensions, which together with continued political risks and financial volatility could foreshadow a broader economic downturn,"" the WTO said in a statement.
The WTO forecast last September that global trade growth would slow to 3.7 percent in 2019 from an estimated 3.9 percent in 2018, but there could be a steeper slowdown or a rebound depending on policy steps, it said.
The quarterly indicator is based on merchandise trade volume in the previous quarter, export orders, international air freight, container port throughput, car production and sales, electronic components and agricultural raw materials.
""Indices for export orders (95.3), international air freight (96.8), automobile production and sales (92.5), electronic components (88.7) and agricultural raw materials (94.3) have shown the strongest deviations from trend, approaching or surpassing previous lows since the financial crisis,"" the WTO said.
The index for container port throughput remained relatively buoyant at 100.3, but that may have been influenced by a front-loading of shipments before an anticipated hike in U.S.-China tariffs, the WTO said.
International trade tensions could spike next month if the United States and China escalate their tariff war, a step that could have negative consequences for the world trading system, according to the United Nations trade agency UNCTAD.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economic outlook remains weak despite some improvement in investor morale in February, the ZEW institute said on Tuesday, pointing to sluggish demand from abroad and weak industrial production.
The German economy, Europe's largest, just skirted recession in the final quarter of last year, as fallout from global trade disputes and Britain's decision to leave the European Union put the brakes on a decade of expansion.
""At the moment, we do not expect a rapid recovery of the slowing German economy. The economic situation in Germany has been weak, especially in the manufacturing sector,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said.
The ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors edged up to -13.4 in February from -15.0 in January. Economists had expected -14.0.
A separate gauge measuring investor assessment of current conditions fell to 15.0 from 27.6 in the previous month. That was the lowest since December 2014 and compared with market expectations for a fall to 23.0.
Industrial production remained weak and incoming orders were stagnant, Wambach said, meaning that foreign demand was not providing any fresh impetus for the economy.
""For the next six months, the financial market experts in our survey do not expect any improvement,"" Wambach said.
The German government expects domestic demand to be the sole driver of growth this year, predicting gross domestic product will expand 1.0 percent.
In a sign that Germany's labor market remains robust despite the cooling economy, a survey by the IAB research institute showed on Tuesday that job vacancies reached a record high at 1.46 million in the final quarter of last year.
""The outlook for the labor market continues to be positive,"" IAB researcher Alexander Kubis said.

Record-high employment, rising real wages and low borrowing costs are expected to support consumer spending in the coming months. That should provide a buffer against external risks, such as Britain leaving the EU without an agreement and the United States imposing higher tariffs on cars from Europe.

The ZEW Center for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment rose to -13.4 points this month from a reading of -15.0 in January. That\'s a tad better than the -14.1 expected by analysts ahead of time.
However, the Current Conditions Index fell to 15.0 from 27.6, compared to expectations for a reading of 20.0.
An index level above 0.0 notionally indicates optimism, whereas a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism. In reality, the ZEW index is more useful as a gauge of turning points in the economic mood, rather than as a measure of absolute levels.
The forward-looking index has been improving since October, while the Current Conditions index has been trending down since January 2018. Both trends basically continued unchanged in February.
Recent data showed that the German economy only narrowly avoided slipping into a recession at the end of last year, amid global trade conflicts, messy Brexit negotiations and the after-effects of the diesel emissions scandal on its auto sector.
A new threat to the auto sector is now emerging: U.S. President Donald Trump is reviewing a report from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that reportedly describes auto imports as a threat to U.S. national security - a classification that could pave the way for import tariffs on German cars."

Total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.4 percent in the three months to December, remaining at its fastest pace since mid-2008, the Office for National Statistics said.
The increase was a touch below a forecast for a pick-up to 3.5 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses also rose by 3.4 percent on the year, in line with the poll forecast.
Britain's strong labour market has defied a slowdown in the economy since the 2016 Brexit vote.
The number of people in work rose by 167,000 in the three months to December, stronger than the poll's forecast of 140,000. It was the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2018.
With Britain due to leave the European Union in just over a month's time, and still no clarity on whether it will have a transition deal to smooth the shock, many companies have cut investment in equipment, potentially making them more likely to hire workers. 
However, Honda's announcement that it will close a plant with the loss of 3,500 jobs and Nissan's decision not to build a new model of car in Britain have raised concerns about the impact of Brexit on big manufacturers.
With unemployment at its lowest rate since 1975 - 4.0 percent in the three months to December - employers have begun raising pay for staff more quickly.
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a human resources professional body, said on Monday private-sector employers planned to increase basic pay rates this year by the most since the survey started in 2012.
The Bank of England has said it will need to raise interest rates gradually to offset inflation pressures from rising pay.
Earlier this month, it forecast wage growth would slow to 3.0 percent by the end of 2019 - as the economy felt the drag of Brexit uncertainty and a slowing global growth - before picking up again.
However, the pace of wage rises remains slower than the 4 percent increases seen before the financial crisis.

When adjusted for inflation, total earnings rose by 1.3 percent, the fastest increase since late 2016, the ONS said.

The U.K. unemployment rate held steady at a multi-decade low, while wage inflation, including bonuses, held steady, according to official data released Tuesday.
The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.0% in the three months to December, matching expectations. That was its lowest level since February 1975.
The number of people in work in the UK rose 167,000, more than the 152,000 expected.
The claimant count, which measures the change in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits, rose 14,200 in January from 20,800 in December.
Economists had forecast an increase of 12,300.
Average earnings, excluding bonuses, continued to rise at their fastest pace since the financial crisis over 10 years ago, jumping 3.4% in the three months to December. That was in line with forecasts and the revised rate registered through November.
Including bonuses, pay growth rose by an annual 3.4%, below expectations for a 3.5% gain. It increased 3.4% in November.
The Bank of England has pointed to rising wages and their upward pressure on consumer price inflation as part of its argument for the need for it to raise interest rates gradually, but escalating uncertainty with regard to the outcome of Brexit negotiations with the European Union has kept the central bank on hold.
In the most recent update to its forecasts, the central bank cut U.K. growth expectations due to Brexit and the slowdown in the global economy. Analysts said its latest projections implied two quarter-point rate rises over the next two years, one less than had been expected in November.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, BoE economist Gertjan Vlieghe said recently he expected the BoE would keep interest rates on hold for quite a long time or even cut them to help the economy."""

With global trade tensions intensifying and Chinese economic growth slowing, European exports have taken a hit in recent months and the bloc's trade surplus is declining unexpectedly quickly. 
In the 12 months to December, the surplus was 3.0 percent of the bloc's gross domestic product, down from 3.2 percent in the preceding 12-month period, with the trade surplus narrowing even more.

The ECB earlier said it expected the current account surplus to drop to 2.7 percent of GDP this year and shrink further to 2.5 percent by 2021.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's current account surplus shrank but remained by far the world's largest last year due to strong exports, according to data from the Ifo institute on Tuesday that is likely to renew criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's fiscal policies.
The International Monetary Fund and the European Commission have urged Germany for years to do more to lift domestic demand as a way to boost imports, stimulate growth elsewhere and reduce global economic imbalances. Since he took office, U.S. President Donald Trump has also criticized Germany's export strength.
Germany's current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, was the world's largest for the third year running in 2018 at $294 billion, followed by Japan with $173 billion, the Ifo figures showed. Russia came in third with a surplus of $116 billion.
When measured in relation to economic output, Germany's current account surplus shrank for the third year in a row, however, falling to 7.4 percent in 2018 from 7.9 percent the previous year, according to the Ifo figures.
Since 2011, Germany's current account balance has been consistently above the European Commission's indicative threshold of 6 percent of gross domestic product and the surplus reached a record high of 8.9 percent in 2015.
The European Commission formally identified a macro-economic imbalance in Germany for the first time in 2014 and has confirmed this criticism every year since.
In its recommendations, the Commission says Germany should make use of its budget surplus to boost public investment and create favorable conditions for stronger real wage growth. The IMF has made similar recommendations.
German government officials have repeatedly said that Berlin's fiscal and economic policies are not primarily designed to influence the current account balance.
They say the trade surplus is a result of market-based supply and demand decisions by companies and consumers around the world and that it is also shaped by other factors such as oil prices and exchange rates that are hard to influence.

Nonetheless, the government has decided to spend a large part of its budget surplus in the coming three years to increase childcare benefits, lower taxes and reduce contributions to the public health system, measures that are expected to support household spending.

The Citi barometer, which measures whether U.S. economic data come in weaker or stronger than analysts forecast, is monitored by traders for the U.S. growth trajectory. It stood at -23.6 points on Friday, down from 17.1 points a week earlier.
The index's drop this week was the steepest weekly decrease since a 60.0 point fall in June 2011.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing fell sharply in January, led by the biggest drop in motor vehicle production since the recession, the latest indication that the economy was losing momentum.
The Federal Reserve's report on Friday came on the heels of data on Thursday showing retail sales tumbling by the most in more than nine years in December. The string of weak reports together with tame inflation are supportive of the Fed's pledge to be ""patient"" before raising interest rates further this year. 
""It looks like Fed officials were smart to stop their gradual rate hikes as the economy seems to have entered a soft patch,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Manufacturing production slumped 0.9 percent in January, the biggest drop in eight months. Data for December was revised down to show output at factories rising 0.8 percent instead of the previously report 1.1 percent surge. Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
Motor vehicle and parts production tumbled 8.8 percent last month, the largest drop since May 2009, when the economy was in recession. Motor vehicle assemblies fell to an eight-month low rate of 10.6 million units. 
Automakers are cutting back on production to manage bloated inventories of some models in anticipation of declining sales this year. Production is also dropping as a few plants are changing over to new models.
But even stripping out motor vehicle production, manufacturing output decreased 0.2 percent in January. Factory activity is slowing as some of the boost to capital spending from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. 
In addition, a strong dollar and cooling growth in Europe and China are hurting exports. Lower oil prices are also slowing purchases of equipment for oil and gas well drilling. 
While a separate report from the New York Fed on Friday showed factory production in New York state picking up in February after cooling for two straight months, the pace remained close to a two-year low. The New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index rose to a reading of 8.8 from 3.9 in January.
""Manufacturing output growth will probably continue to trend lower over the coming months,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London.
U.S. stocks were higher amid growing optimism over trade talks between Washington and Beijing. The dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
WEAK IMPORT PRICES
In a third report on Friday, the Labor Department said import prices decreased 0.5 percent last month as the cost of petroleum products fell and a strong dollar weighed on prices of motor vehicles and consumer goods. Import prices dropped by an unrevised 1.0 percent in December. 
Import prices declined 3.1 percent over the last three months, the biggest three-month decrease since July-October 2015. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices dipping 0.1 percent in January.
In the 12 months through January, import prices tumbled 1.7 percent. That was the biggest annual decline since August 2016 and followed a 0.5 percent drop in December.
Data this week showed consumer prices unchanged in January for a third straight month and producer prices falling for a second consecutive month. The inflation reports support the Fed's recent description of price pressures as being ""muted."" 
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged last month and discarded promises of ""further gradual increases"" in borrowing costs in its policy statement. 
""Import prices suggest that domestic inflationary pressures won't suddenly build,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Therefore, the Fed has the green light to pause until June, if not longer.""
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants fell 3.2 percent after plunging 8.6 percent in December. Prices for imported petroleum dipped 0.1 percent after tumbling 10.7 percent in December.
Imported food prices fell 0.3 percent in January after edging up 0.1 percent in the prior month. Excluding fuels and food, import prices fell 0.2 percent last month after being unchanged in December. The so-called core import prices were flat in the 12 months through January.

The benign inflation outlook was also underscored by a fourth report from the University of Michigan showing consumers' long-term inflation expectations fell in early February to the lowest since December 2016. The survey's consumer sentiment index rose 4.3 points to 95.5 early this month.

The preliminary publication of the data for February from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that the consumer sentiment index increased to 95.5 from 91.2 a month earlier.
Economists had forecast a rise to 93.3.
“The early February gains reflect the end of the partial government shutdown as well as a more fundamental shift in consumer expectations due to the Fed's pause in raising interest rates,” the surveyor’s chief economist Richard Curtin said.
The recovery marks a sharp contrast to recent economic data that has exacerbated concerns about an economic slowdown.
Data on Thursday showed that U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest drop in more than nine years in December. That came alongside an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week, which pushed the four-week moving average of claims to a one-year high, an indication that job growth was moderating.
At the same time, inflation seemed to be held in check, with the consumer price index flat compared to the prior month and core readings holding steady, while the producer price index registered its second-consecutive drop month on month.
Along those lines, Curtin noted that the survey revealed that consumers' long-term inflation expectations fell to the lowest level recorded in the past half century.
“The data suggest that the Fed will find it even harder to justify another rate hike given the record low inflation expectations,” he added."

Euro zone imports increased last year by 6.2 percent, while exports rose only 3.7 percent compared to 2017.

The EU's trade deficit with Russia, its main energy supplier, increased last year to 82.8 billion euros from 58.9 billion in 2017.
The EU's overall trade surplus was mostly due to Germany, its largest economy, which alone produced a surplus in its trade with non-EU countries of 176.6 billion euros last year. The figure was however lower than the 184.6-billion-euro surplus recorded in 2017. 
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone had a trade surplus of 15.6 billion euros in December, almost unchanged from 15.8 billions in November, Eurostat said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales rebounded strongly in January as steep clothing discounts attracted wary shoppers, bucking a slowdown in consumer spending ahead of Brexit.
Retail sales volumes jumped by a monthly 1.0 percent after their biggest fall in December in a year-and-a-half, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, far above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a 0.2 percent rise.
Compared with a year ago, retail sales were 4.2 percent higher in January, the biggest annual rise since December 2016 and again outstripping almost all forecasts in the poll.
Sterling edged a little higher against the dollar on the back of the figures.
Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank Commercial Banking, said Friday's data were ""undoubtedly a positive"" although the big picture remained one of cautious spending.
""There's a big difference between tempting shoppers with bargains and persuading them to keep buying once January's discounts and New Year's resolution purchases are over though,"" he added. 
The ONS said clothing sales grew strongly thanks to the biggest cuts in annual terms since August 2016. Food sales also grew after a slight dip over the Christmas period.
Britain's economy slowed sharply in the last few months of 2018 but Friday's data suggested that consumer spending remains resilient, even if other parts of the economy like manufacturing are struggling ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union.
Brexit is due on March 29 but there is no clarity yet on whether Britain can leave with a transition deal, something that has hammered business investment. 
Looking at the three months to January compared with a year ago, which smooths out some monthly volatility, retail sales growth picked up to a six-month high of 3.5 percent from 2.9 percent in December.
Clothing sales on this measure grew by the largest volume since September 2017.
Friday's data chimed with other signs that consumer spending may have recovered partially from a slowdown late last year, when households tightened their belts after splashing out during a hot summer and the soccer World Cup.
A recent survey from the British Retail Consortium showed shops enjoyed the fastest sales growth in seven months -- a bit of relief after their worst Christmas in a decade.
There has also been some comfort for consumers in recent data which has shown the fastest growth in underlying pay since 2008 and inflation falling to a two-year low of 1.8 percent.

The measure of inflation used in the retail sales data showed a 0.4 percent annual increase in January, the smallest rise since November 2016.

Core machinery orders, a volatile data series seen as a leading indicator of capital expenditure, are expected to have fallen in December for the first time in three months, suggesting business investment could weaken.
Separate data are expected to show core consumer prices edged higher in January from the same period a year earlier but remained well off the pace needed to get near the Bank of Japan's 2 percent inflation target.
On the whole, the data could paint a picture of an export-oriented economy that is shifting down to a lower pace of growth as uncertainty about trade frictions hits global demand.
""Exports are struggling to grow, reflecting slower expansion in the global economy and global trade,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""There's a high chance capex plans will remain firm for the remainder of fiscal 2018, but other indicators related to capex... have not looked so bright.""
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each others' goods in a trade dispute that is a danger to Japan, because its exporters focus on shipping parts and heavy machinery to manufacturers in China. China's economy is also slowing under pressure from cooling domestic demand. 
Japan's policymakers hoped export growth would drive corporate profits, which would then lead to higher business investment and higher wages, but this scenario is looking less likely to happen this year.
Exports in January fell 5.5 percent from the same period a year ago, according to the median of a Reuters poll of 15 economists. That would mark the fastest decline since exports fell 10.3 percent in October 2016.
Japan's imports fell 2.8 percent in January, according to the poll, which would mark a reversal from a 1.9 percent annual expansion in December.
The trade deficit is expected to widen to 1.01 trillion yen ($9.16 billion) from 55.3 billion yen in the previous month, the poll showed.
The Finance Ministry will release trade data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Wednesday, Feb. 20 (2350 GMT, Feb. 19).
Core machinery orders, which exclude those for ships and from electricity utilities, are forecast to have fallen 1.1 percent from the previous month, the first decline since a record 18.3 percent tumble in September.
The Cabinet Office will release machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday, Feb. 18 (2350 GMT, Feb. 17).
Japan's core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, is expected to rise 0.8 percent year-on-year in January.
That would be a slight acceleration over a 0.7 percent annual increase in December but is still lacking momentum to meet the central bank's price target.

The Internal Affairs Ministry will announce data on consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. Tokyo time on Feb. 22 (2330 GMT on Feb. 21).

The country’s CPI, a key indicator to measure inflation and changes in purchasing trends, rose 1.7% in January from a year earlier, slower than the 1.9% increase in December and below market expectations for a 1.9% rise.
Meanwhile, the PPI rose 0.1% year-on-year in January, the weakest pace since September 2016 and slowing from the previous month's 0.9% increase.
The data raised concerns of heightened deflationary risks and could hurt corporate profitability.
However, tame inflation also gives authorities more flexibility to ease monetary policy which would in turn help supporting economic growth.
""With factory-gate deflation likely to deepen in the coming months, we expect policymakers to roll out further measures to ease financial pressure on industrial firms, including cuts to benchmark lending rates,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a Reuters report.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.6% and 0.3% by 11:03 PM ET (04:04 GMT) following the release of the data.
On Thursday, China reported better-than-expected January trade data, but analysts said the positive data was likely due to seasonal factors and business distortions caused by the long Lunar New Year holidays."

Consumer inflation, meanwhile, eased in January from December to a 12-month low due to slower gains in food prices, official data showed on Friday, despite the Lunar New Year holiday, which typically pushes up demand for food.
China's producer price index (PPI) in January rose a meagre 0.1 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, a sharp slowdown from the previous month's 0.9 percent increase. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected producer inflation would slow to 0.2 percent.
While tame inflation gives authorities the flexibility to ease monetary policy to shore up economic growth, deflationary risks could further hurt corporate profitability.
On a monthly basis, producer prices have already been falling over the past three months. In December, PPI fell 0.6 percent, moderating from a 1 percent decrease in December. 
""It is too early to say China has entered the deflationary environment, but the risks definitely have heightened,"" said Raymond Yeung, Chief Economist of Greater China at ANZ, adding that profitability of upstream industries will come under pressure.
Earnings at China's industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, putting pressure on policymakers to support industries hurt by slowing prices and weak factory activity.
Data showed prices for raw materials fell in January for the first time in over two years, swinging from an 0.8 percent rise in December. Price rises in the production sector also turned negative.
Recent factory surveys show weakening domestic orders and shrinking business activity, with both official and private sector reports pointing to growing strains in China's manufacturing sector, a key source of growth and jobs.
Domestic demand for industrial goods and services has eased in recent months as the government's multi-year campaign to curb corporate debt and risky lending practices crimps capital spending and corporate investment.
""With factory-gate deflation likely to deepen in the coming months, we expect policymakers to roll out further measures to ease financial pressure on industrial firms, including cuts to benchmark lending rates,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
The CPI rose 1.7 percent in January from a year earlier, slower than the 1.9 percent increase in December, and below expectations of a 1.9 percent gain.
On a month-on-month basis, the CPI rose 0.5 percent. 
The food price index in January rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier, down from December's reading of 2.5 percent, data showed on Friday.
The moderation in food prices breaks the historic pattern of acceletation that typically precedes the week-long Lunar New Year, which came in the first week of February this year.
While the slowdown was due in part to a decline in pork prices as the effects of African Swine Fever on the industry receded, the broader impact on prices pressures remains a concern.

The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.9 percent year-on-year, accelerating from 1.8 percent's gain in December.

142,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 10:00PM ET</span>","China’s Slowing Factory Prices Add to Deflation, Profit Concerns","(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation decelerated for a seventh month, adding to concerns about the return of deflation and the impact that will have on already weak corporate profits.
The producer price index rose 0.1 percent in January from a year earlier, the seventh straight month it has slowed, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Economists expect it to rise 0.9 percent in 2019, well below the 3.5 percent increase last year.
Industrial profits started falling late last year and the continued slide in factory prices will exacerbate that, increasing pressure on companies which are already struggling due to the slowing economy. Factory disinflation will also likely have a downward impact on export prices, pushing them down prices around the world.
“Today’s figure bodes ill for profitability upstream,” said Raymond Yeung at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, noting that prices for production materials actually declined 0.1 percent. “Falling factory prices will drag on industrial profits of the respective industries.”
Consumer price inflation also slowed, rising 1.7 percent from a year earlier. With a continued slowdown in industrial output and consumption, a further deceleration in China’s economy will hurt demand for imported goods.
The nation’s economy could slow for another three to four quarters, Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd. wrote in a recent note, adding that “2019 could see the return of PPI deflation and negative earnings growth.”
""Today’s figure bodes ill to the outlook of China’s manufacturing. Given a low inflationary environment, the PBOC will likely keep interest rates low,"" said ANZ’s Yeung. ""As the deflation risk heightens, there is actually pressure for the policymaker to consider interest rate cut.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's manufacturing industry expects to export less in 2019 because of uncertainty around delayed ratification of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, global trade tensions and the effects of domestic labor strikes.
The maquiladora and export manufacturing industry, which includes the automotive, aerospace, electrical components, medical equipment and household appliances sectors, exported goods worth $280 billion and grew between 10-12 percent last year, according to industry group INDEX.
But INDEX, the National Council of Maquiladora and Export Manufacturing Industry, projects growth in 2019 of between 5-7 percent for this year, according to its president, Luis Aguirre.
The industry accounted for about 67 percent of non-oil total exports in 2018 and employs almost two out of every 10 working Mexicans, according to government figures.
The forecast growth reflects a trade war between the United States and China and the impact of U.S. restrictions on steel and aluminum products imported from Mexico, Aguirre said in a telephone news conference.
Concerns about a possible delay in the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, weighed on the view for export growth this year, Aguirre added. 
In the border city of Matamoros, in Tamaulipas state, a strike at 48 maquiladora plants that began on Jan. 25 led to daily losses of up to $50 million for breaches of international contracts.
A union representing the factory workers ended the strike last weekend, but new strikes broke out in other plants in Tamaulipas and the INDEX fears they may be replicated in other states.

Urging a resolution, INDEX called for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and other authorities to ""immediately intervene.""

144,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 02:19PM ET</span>",Weakest U.S. retail sales since 2009 cast pall over economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest drop in more than nine years in December as receipts fell across the board, suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2018.
The shockingly weak report from the Commerce Department on Thursday led to growth estimates for the fourth-quarter being cut to below a 2.0 percent annualized rate.
December's collapse in retail sales and other data showing an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week and a second straight monthly decline in producer prices in January support the Federal Reserve's pledge to be ""patient"" before raising interest rates further this year.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. retail sales - http://tmsnrt.rs/2eXblwp)
(GRAPHIC: Weekly U.S. jobless claims - http://tmsnrt.rs/2gbkbf2)
""Until this morning, Fed official hesitance to hike further was based on risks emanating from global growth and from financial markets, despite a strong domestic outlook,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""The decline in retail sales calls into question the domestic growth assumption."" 
Retail sales tumbled 1.2 percent, the largest decline since September 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession. Sales edged up 0.1 percent in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales gaining 0.2 percent in December. Sales in December rose 2.3 percent from a year ago.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. retail sales weaken sharply - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TTuIMc)
The December retail sales report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. No date has been set for the release of the January retail sales report, which was scheduled for publication on Friday.
With online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reporting strong December sales and independent data on chain-store sales robust, some economists joined White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow in questioning the credibility of the report. 
They argued that the longest government shutdown in history could have impacted on the collection of data. But the Commerce Department said the ""processing and data quality were monitored throughout and response rates were at or above normal levels for this release.""
Others were reluctant to dismiss the retail sales report, noting that the plunge in sales came as consumer confidence dropped and the U.S. stock market suffered its worst December. 
The weak report was corroborated by another report on Thursday from the National Retail Federation showing holiday spending in 2018 grew 2.9 percent to $707.5 billion, with sales in December falling 1.5 percent from November.
""The most plausible economic explanation is that long-dormant wealth effects came back with a vengeance, and consumers slashed their holiday purchases when they saw their 401(k)s going down the drain,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York, referring to the retirement savings plans held by millions of Americans. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dropped 1.7 percent last month, the biggest fall since September 2001. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
They surged 1.0 percent in November. December's sharp drop in core retail sales suggested a cooling in the pace of consumer spending in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, increased at a 3.5 percent rate in the July-September quarter.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. retail sales weaken sharply - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ea0gYC)
The fourth-quarter growth picture also took a hit from another report from the Commerce Department that showed retail inventories excluding automobiles tumbled 1.0 percent in November, the most since December 2008.
The Atlanta Fed slashed its GDP growth estimate for the October-December quarter by 1.2 percentage points to a 1.5 percent rate. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
U.S. Treasury prices rose on the data, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, but losses were capped by optimism over U.S.-China trade talks.
BROAD WEAKNESS 
In December, online and mail-order retail sales decreased 3.9 percent, the biggest drop since November 2008. Receipts at service stations dived 5.1 percent, the biggest fall since February 2016, reflecting cheaper gasoline prices.
There were also declines in receipts at clothing and furniture stores. Americans also cut spending at restaurants and bars. Sales at hobby, musical instrument and book stores plunged 4.9 percent, the biggest drop since September 2008. 
But sales at auto dealerships rose 1.0 percent in December and receipts at building material stores gained 0.3 percent.
The outlook for consumer spending, which has been underpinned by a strong labor market and cheaper gasoline, is not encouraging. A report this week from the New York Fed showed the overall debt shouldered by Americans edged up to a record $13.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended Feb. 9.
""The trend in claims appears to have risen a bit, consistent with at least some slowing in employment growth,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
A fourth report from the Labor Department showed the producer price index for final demand dipped 0.1 percent last month as the cost of energy products and food fell. The PPI also fell 0.1 percent in December. 
In the 12 months through January, the PPI rose 2.0 percent. That was the smallest gain since July 2017 and followed a 2.5 percent rise in December. The PPI report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing consumer prices were unchanged in January for a third straight month.

""This further corroborates our view that a well-behaved inflationary environment gives the Fed room to remain patient, hiking only once in 2019 and only after a pause in the first half,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

(Reuters) - U.S. holiday spending in 2018 grew a lower-than-expected 2.9 percent to $707.5 billion, the National Retail Federation said on Thursday, citing turmoil over trade policy and the recent government shutdown as having hurt the industry.
""All signs during the holidays seemed to show that consumers remained confident about the economy,"" NRF President and Chief Executive Matthew Shay said in a statement. 
""However, it appears that worries over the trade war and turmoil in the stock markets impacted consumer behavior more than we expected,"" he said.
NRF's numbers are based on data from the U.S. Commerce Department, which said on Thursday that overall December sales – including auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants – were down 1.2 percent seasonally adjusted from November but up 2.3 percent unadjusted year-over-year.
The retail group said sales in November grew 5.1 percent but in December were up only 0.9 percent year-over-year and were down 1.5 percent seasonally adjusted from November. NRF does not count October as part of the holiday season.
The numbers fell short of NRF's forecast last fall that holiday sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 would grow between 4.3 percent and 4.8 percent, to between $717.45 billion and $720.89 billion.
The holiday retail sales numbers exclude automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants, NRF said.
The trade body also said online and other non-store sales, which are included in the overall number, grew 11.5 percent to $146.8 billion. NRF had forecast the online sector of retail would grow between 11 percent and 15 percent, to between $151.6 billion and $157 billion.
""Today's numbers are truly a surprise and in contradiction to the consumer spending trends we were seeing, especially after such strong October and November spending,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said. 
""The combination of financial market volatility, the government shutdown and trade tensions created a trifecta of anxiety and uncertainty impacting spending and might also have misaligned the seasonal adjustment factors used in reporting data,"" he said.
Earlier this month the trade body said it expected U.S. retail sales to rise between 3.8 percent and 4.4 percent to more than $3.8 trillion in 2019, encouraged by higher consumer confidence, low unemployment and rising wages.

It also said it expects the overall economy to gain an average of 170,000 jobs per month in 2019, down from 220,000 in 2018. It said unemployment, currently at 4 percent, will drop to 3.5 percent by the end of the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wealthfront, one of the largest digital wealth management firms known as ""robo-advisers"", said on Thursday it is expanding its suite of financial products by introducing a cash account with a rate on deposits of 2.24 percent, significantly higher than the average U.S. rate.
The accounts will be launched through partnerships with several banks, including East West Bank and New York Community Bank, and will be protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $1 million, the company said. 
Average rates at insured U.S. depository institutions, including mainstream banks, are 0.06 percent for checking and 0.09 percent for savings, according to the FDIC.
""Our clients hold almost $12 billion in cash and a lot of it is earning next to nothing,"" Dan Carroll, Wealthfront's founder and chief strategy officer, said in an interview. ""We think they have an opportunity to get more out of it."" 
Wealthfront clients will be able to open the account by depositing as little as $1, the company said. 
Financial technology companies have started to move beyond their initial area of focus, and several are seeking to lure deposits through higher interest rates than those offered by banks.
Student lender Social Finance last year launched a checking account with a 2 percent interest rate, and British money transfer company TransferWise introduced a low-cost multi-currency account.
Not all launches have gone smoothly, however. In December, trading startup Robinhood suspended the launch of what it called a ""checking and savings"" service offering 3 percent interest after reports that the deposits might not be insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which covers cash accounts at brokerages, as originally marketed by the company.
Wealthfront, which has more than $11 billion in assets under management, is best known for its robo-adviser function of automating the creation and management of portfolios made up of low cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The Silicon Valley start-up hopes to be able to automate the management of all of its customers' finances and said that the launch of the cash account was a step towards that goal.

147,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Delayed Data Confirms It: U.S. Christmas Spending Disappointed,"(Bloomberg) -- So much for a merry Christmas.
Even though investors entered the holidays expecting a surge of spending, figures released Thursday by the Commerce Department show that wasn’t the case. U.S. retail sales fell 1.2 percent in December from the previous month, not the slight increase economists had been expecting. That marks the biggest drop since 2009.
The economic data backs up what some big consumer companies have already indicated: Sales weakened in December after a strong start to the holiday period during an earlier-than-normal Black Friday weekend. Even low gas prices and a more confident consumer couldn’t make up for an extended holiday season with promotions and free-shipping deals that started months before Christmas.
The disappointing holiday-period spending doesn’t bode well for the next round of apparel and department-store results, scheduled for release in coming weeks. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., the world’s biggest retailer, reports its fourth-quarter results next week. Macy’s Inc.,  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY). and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN). will also report before the end of the month. Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette already warned in January that sales “weakened in the mid-December period and did not return to expected patterns until the week of Christmas.”
Not only was the report on December spending disappointing, but it also came much later than normal. Wall Street usually gets numbers on year-end spending by mid-January, but the partial federal-government shutdown meant those results were postponed by nearly a month.

Producer prices fell 0.1% in the month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. That’s below consensus forecasts for an uptick of 0.1%.
The year-on-year price index fell to 2.0% from 2.5% in January – its lowest level since July 2017.
The figures further underline the loss of inflationary pressure in the economy in recent months that has led the Federal Reserve to put its cycle of monetary policy tightening on hold.
However, the core PPI  index, which strips out volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3% on the month and 2.6% on the year – both above expectations.
That suggests that underlying activity is still robust, validating Fed chairman Jerome Powell’s comments last week that the U.S. is currently “in a good place” economically, with low unemployment and still-strong growth."

In the 12 months through January, the PPI rose 2.0 percent. That was the smallest gain since July 2017 and followed a 2.5 percent rise in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent in January and increasing 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after being unchanged in December. 
The so-called core PPI increased 2.5 percent in the 12 months through January, the smallest gain since January 2018, after rising 2.8 percent in December.

The report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing consumer prices were unchanged in January for a third straight month. Inflation remains tame despite a tightening labor market that is starting to push up wage growth, buttressing the Fed's pledge to be ""patient"" before raising interest rates further. 
Last month, wholesale energy prices fell 3.8 percent after declining 4.3 percent in December. Wholesale food prices dropped 1.7 percent last month after rising 2.6 percent in December.
Overall, the cost of wholesale goods tumbled 0.8 percent in January after falling 0.3 percent in the prior month. Core goods rose 0.3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in December. The cost of services rose 0.3 percent in January after being unchanged in the prior month.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended Feb. 9, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised up to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Claims surged to a near 1-1/2-year high of 253,000 in the week ended Jan. 26. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 225,000 in the latest week.

Despite the recent jump in claims, layoffs remain low amid companies struggling to find workers. The government reported on Tuesday that there were a record 7.3 million job openings in December.
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 37,000 to 1.77 million for the week ended Feb. 2. The four-week moving average of these so-called continuing claims rose 9,000 to 1.75 million."

Core retail sales - which exclude automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services and more closely corresponds to the U.S. consumer spending component of gross domestic product - declined 1.8%.
Economists had forecast core growth to post a flat reading.
The Commerce Department released this data, accounting for about 70% of the American economy, later than normal due to delay from the five-week long partial government shutdown.
The January gauge of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan hit its lowest level in two years as pessimism over the government shutdown and the uncertainty over the economic outlook made consumers cautious.
Recent business and manufacturing surveys have pointed to a slowdown in growth while some retailers warned about weak holiday sales.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) warned at the beginning of February that retail sales growth was expected to slow in 2019 amid a wider cooling off of the global economy.
NRF president Matt Shay warned that headwinds from another pending government shutdown, currently slated for Feb. 15, and ongoing trade disputes could hit consumers at a time when the benefits of tax cuts were coming to an end.
“The biggest priority is to ensure that our economy continues to grow and to avoid self-inflicted wounds. It\'s time for artificial problems like trade wars and shutdowns to end, and to focus on prosperity not politics,” Shay added.
Looking ahead to January retail sales, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, warned that more signs of weakness could be on the horizon.
“Consumer confidence has already started to ebb away and that tends to prompt a tightening of belts. This could be reflected in the latest January retail sales numbers, which generally see a dip after Christmas, as consumers pay off their December extravagances,” Hewson said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy stalled in the final quarter of last year, narrowly escaping recession, as the fallout from global trade disputes and Brexit threatened to derail a decade-long expansion in Europe's economic powerhouse.
Gross domestic product in Europe's biggest economy was unchanged for the quarter, the Federal Statistics Office said on Thursday. A Reuters poll had forecast growth of 0.1 percent.
German companies are grappling with a cooling global economy and trade disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump. It also faces the risk that Britain will leave the European Union in March without an agreement on the terms of its withdrawal.
""Germany got away with a black eye,"" DekaBank economist Andreas Scheuerle said of the fourth-quarter numbers. ""But the first quarter is not looking like it is going to be easy, either, as political uncertainties are weighing heavily on corporate confidence.""
With growth unchanged in the fourth quarter, the economy escaped recession -- defined as two or more consecutive quarters of contraction -- after it shrank by 0.2 percent in the third quarter.
Germany's economy grew at its weakest rate in five years in 2018. Growth is forecast to shrink further to 1 percent this year, and the country faces a budget shortfall of around 25 billion euros by 2023.
The fallout from the trade disputes and concern about Brexit are weighing on business confidence, which fell for the fifth consecutive month in January.
Morale is also being depressed by weaker demand for German goods and services in China, the euro zone and emerging markets.
Furthermore, the government is concerned that technological innovation and the acquisition of German industrial know-how by foreign - particularly Chinese - companies could erode the manufacturing base on which much of Germany's wealth is built.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said last week the government might take stakes in key domestic companies to prevent foreign takeovers - a shift in policy he said was needed to safeguard Germany's prosperity.
Presenting an unusually gloomy outlook for Europe's biggest economy, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said late last month the economic slump would last longer than earlier thought and more bad news was coming.
With German growth stalling, the European Central Bank is likely put off plans to normalise policy any further, economists say, and it is more likely to provide further stimulus, rather than less.
""The upside from today's data is that it can hardly get worse,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""Economic fundamentals remain solid, and from here on, chances of a rebound are still much higher than chances of yet another disappointment,"" he added.

The jobless rate fell to 8.8 percent from 9.1 percent in the previous quarter, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009 in the depths of the global financial crisis. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast on average that unemployment had remained stable at 9.1 percent. 
Although job growth has slowed as the euro zone's second-biggest economy struggled to gain momentum last year, thousands of new jobs are being created.
That pushed the employment rate to 66.1 percent from 65.9 in the third quarter, to its highest level since 1980, INSEE said.
President Emmanuel Macron took aim at France's stubbornly high unemployment in his first major policy move in 2017 by easing the country's strict labor laws, which employers have long said is an obstacle to hiring.
Excluding French overseas territories where joblessness tends to be higher, the unemployment rate in mainland France fell to 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 8.8 percent in the third quarter and also the lowest rate since early 2009.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly returned to growth in January after a shock decline the previous month, while imports fell much less than expected, but analysts said the strength was likely due to seasonal factors and predicted renewed trade weakness ahead. 
Investors and policymakers are closely watching to see how quickly activity in China is cooling, or if support measures announced last year are starting to take hold, which could lift some of the gloom hanging over the global economy.
But data on Thursday left many China watchers none the wiser about the current state of the world's second-largest economy, as a March 1 deadline looms for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their bitter trade war. 
January exports rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed, defying economists' expectations for a 3.2 percent drop and a marked turnaround from December's 4.4 percent decline.
Imports fell 1.5 percent, much better than forecasts for a 10 percent slide and narrowing from December's 7.6 percent drop.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $39.16 billion for the month.
While the readings appeared positive at first glance, analysts warned that data from China early in the year must be treated with caution due to business distortions caused by the long Lunar New Year holidays, which started on Feb. 4 this year.
Many companies rush out shipments or replenish their inventories of raw materials ahead of the holidays.
""Clearly, the numbers surprised the market on the upside. But given the deceleration of global (factory readings) and weak Korean trade data, it might be pre-mature to conclude that the trade prospect has improved based on the January number alone,"" said Tommy Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.
""I suspect that the recovery may be partially due to the Chinese New Year effect as this year it is slightly earlier as compared to last year.""
Economists had widely tipped that China would see weaker exports early this year.
Factories have reported shrinking overseas orders for months and warehouses in America are packed to the rafters with Chinese goods that retailers stockpiled last year in anticipation of more U.S. tariffs.
Trade has also been faltering globally amid rising protectionism and a loss of momentum in some major economies, most notably in Europe.
Net exports actually dragged on China's growth by 8.6 percent last year, according to Reuters calculations.
Factory surveys have also show weakening domestic orders, and broader economic weakness is taking a toll on both business and consumer confidence. Retail sales during the Lunar New Year holiday rose 8.5 percent from a year earlier, still solid but the slowest pace since at least 2011.
China's economic growth slowed to 6.6 percent in 2018, weighed down by rising borrowing costs and a clampdown on riskier lending that starved smaller, private companies of capital and stifled investment.
THE IDES OF MARCH
Pressure on China's economy could spike if Beijing and Washington do not reach a deal soon to end their year-long trade dispute, which is estimated to have cost both countries billions of dollars already and is taking a growing toll on other export-reliant economies from Asia to Europe.
The U.S. is set to sharply raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports in early March, though President Donald Trump said this week he could let the deadline ""slide for a little while"" if a deal appears close.
A U.S delegation led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are in Beijing to hammer out a trade agreement.
China's trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $27.3 billion in January, the lowest since May 2018, Thursday's data showed. Exports to the U.S. declined 2.4 percent on-year, while imports fell 41.2 percent.
""Based on the positive signals regarding the U.S.-China trade negotiations, we think it is likely that further tariff hikes will be suspended,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.
""An agreement and prolonged tariff suspension would be an obvious plus and imply an upside risk to growth of China's exports and economy more generally.""
DEEPER ISSUES FOR CHINA
While a trade deal would boost business confidence and financial markets globally, analysts say it would be no magic bullet for China's broader economic woes. 
Some economists predict China's growth rate could drop below 6 percent in the first half of this year before a series of policy measures start to stabilize activity around mid-year.
The latest quarterly business survey by consultancy Oxford Economics showed 38 percent of respondents thought a hard landing in China was a very significant risk to the global economy, almost double the level in the previous poll.
Policymakers have been fast-tracking road and rail projects, cutting import tariffs and urging banks to keep lending to cash-strapped private companies to rekindle domestic demand.
Many analysts also expect sweeping corporate tax cuts to be announced after the annual meeting of parliament in March, but all of the moves will take time to kick in.
Top officials have repeatedly said they will not resort to massive stimulus like that deployed in past downturns, though some analysts believe interest rate cuts are possible if conditions continue to deteriorate and job losses mount.

158,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 11:35PM ET</span>",China Announces Better-Than-Expected January Trade Data Despite U.S. Trade War,"Investing.com - China’s trade data in January came in better than expected as front-loading ahead of the Lunar New Year boosted sales, customs data showed on Thursday.
January exports unexpectedly grew 9.1% from a year earlier, compared to expectations for a drop of 3.2%, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.
Imports fell 1.5%, much less than the expected 10% fall and narrowing from December’s 7.6% drop.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $39.16 billion for the month, better than forecasts of $33.5 billion.
Analysts said the positive data was likely due to seasonal factors and business distortions caused by the long Lunar New Year holidays, which began on February 5 compared to February 15 in 2018. Data in the first two months of the year must be treated with caution, analysts warned.
Mixo Das, Asia equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, told CNBC that he would not read too much into the trade data released today due to the presence of distortions like the national holidays, cyclical trends and ongoing structural changes.
Das told CNBC he still expected China's economy to bottom in the first half of the year.
Data today also showed China’s trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $27.3 billion in January, from $29.87 billion in December.
That better-than-expected data point came as Chinese and U.S. officials held their latest round of trade negotiations in Beijing this week. Citing unnamed sources, the South China Morning Posts reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Friday.
The two sides are trying to reach an agreement before March 1. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously warned he might double the rate of tariffs on about $200 billions of Chinese goods if the deadline passes without a deal.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 10:17PM ET</span>","Japan's GDP rebounds from quake, floods but trade war hangs over 2019","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy bounced back in the fourth quarter as business and consumer spending recovered from the impact of natural disasters but trade frictions and a proposed sales tax hike are expected to hinder growth in 2019.
The 1.4 percent annualised expansion in October-December matched the median estimate in a Reuters poll. It also followed an upwardly revised 2.6 percent annualised contraction in July-September as floods and an earthquake temporarily halted production.
Real exports rose 0.9 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, the data from the Cabinet Office showed, the fastest growth in a year.
Despite the increase in shipments, economists remain concerned that exports will weaken this year if the United States and China do not resolve their trade dispute.
""The numbers have rebounded, but Japan is still an economy that is losing momentum,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The longer trade friction lasts, the more incentive Japanese companies have to halt capex. Trade friction means weaker exports. Japan's overall growth this year won't be as quick as last year or the year prior.""
GDP rose 0.3 percent versus the previous quarter, slightly less than the median estimate for 0.4 percent growth. That followed a downwardly revised 0.7 percent contraction in July-September.
In September a large earthquake triggered a blackout in the northern island of Hokkaido, which followed severe typhoons that damaged airports and transport infrastructure in western Japan.
Businesses were quick to resume normal operations after these disasters.
Capital expenditure was the biggest driver of growth in October-December, rising 2.4 percent as companies spent on manufacturing equipment and heavy construction machinery.
That compares with as 2.7 percent contraction in the previous quarter, a smaller fall than initially estimated. Capital expenditure was expected to rise 1.8 percent.
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of GDP, was the second-biggest driver of growth. Consumption rose 0.6 percent in October-December, less than the 0.8 percent increase expected and followed a 0.2 decline in the previous quarter.
Consumption was driven by spending on hotels and dining out, but that was partly a rebound from a decline in the previous quarter due to the natural disasters, a Cabinet Office official said.
""The economy is in gradual recovery as growth is led by private demand,"" Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in a statement.
""China-bound exports of information-related materials have weakened as the Chinese economy slowed. We need to monitor uncertainty over global economic outlook including Chinese economy as well as fluctuations in financial markets.""
External demand - or exports minus imports - shaved 0.3 percentage point off gross domestic product, less than the median estimate of minus 0.4 percent. A breakdown of the data showed a 2.7 percent jump in imports due to increased shipments of mobile phones and clothes from overseas more than offset the increase in exports.
Despite the rise in exports, the trade war between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, is seen as a major risk for Japan's exports of car parts, electronics, and heavy machinery to China, which are used to make finished goods destined for the United States and other markets.
""We expect exports for January-March will deteriorate as shipments of IT-related products to Asian nations, especially to China, will likely fall as the adverse impact from trade conflict appears,"" said Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
""The economy for January-March is expected to grow but the global economic slowdown and a planned sales tax hike will hurt.""
Another risk is the Japanese government's plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October.

The government needs the extra tax revenue to pay for rising welfare costs, but some policymakers and economists worry the tax hike could hit consumer spending and weaken sentiment.

The Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said its monthly house price balance sank to -22 last month from December's reading of -19, the lowest since July 2012 and a bigger drop than forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Asked about the outlook for house prices over the next three months, surveyors expected the most widespread price falls since February 2011.
The survey added to other signs of weakness in Britain's housing market and much of the overall economy ahead of the scheduled Brexit date of March 29.
""Resolution of the Brexit negotiations is widely seen as critical to encouraging potential buyers back into the market,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
Britain is on course to leave the European Union without a transition deal unless Prime Minister Theresa May can broker a revised agreement with the bloc that is acceptable to her divided party and parliament.
The volume of property being put up for sale dropped by the most since July 2016, just after Britain voted to leave the EU.
Surveyors reported falling property values across most of England, but gains in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Price falls were sharpest in London and southeast England where affordability was already most stretched and where demand has been most affected by higher taxes on investment properties, foreign buyers and property costing over 1 million pounds.
Official data released on Wednesday showed that United Kingdom house prices rose by an annual 2.5 percent in December, the smallest increase since July 2013.

Over the year to come, RICS said surveyors saw prices as broadly flat and expected them to rise by about 11 percent over the next five years.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 04:11PM ET</span>",U.S. posts another budget deficit as tax revenues sag,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. federal government ran a $14 billion budget deficit in December as revenues sagged following last year's tax cuts even as the economy appeared strong, Treasury Department data showed on Wednesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an $11 billion deficit for the month and the gap was the latest sign of deterioration in the government's fiscal position.
A strong U.S. job market has appeared to power economic growth this year, an economic setting that tends to help fiscal revenues. Economists suspect some of the economic strength draws from tax cuts that came into effect at the beginning of 2018.
But Washington's accounts have run $319 billion into the red since the fiscal year began in October, compared to a $225 billion deficit over the same period a year earlier. 
Corporate taxes collected for the October-December period have fallen 17 percent from a year earlier, while taxes collected from individuals have fallen about 4 percent.
The fiscal deterioration began well before the tax cuts, however. The 12-month sum of fiscal deficits has been on a widening trend since early 2016. Washington collected nearly $900 billion less than it spent in the 2018 calendar year. 
(GRAPHIC: Budget gap - https://tmsnrt.rs/2E8eM2Z)
Wednesday's data was released about a month behind schedule due to a 35-day partial shutdown of the government in December and January. 
The Treasury said federal spending in December was $326 billion, down 7 percent from the same month in 2017, although outlays were slightly higher than a year earlier when accounting for calendar effects. 

Receipts during the month were $313 billion, down 4 percent from a year earlier. When taking into account calendar effects, receipts were down 6 percent from a year earlier.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 12:33PM ET</span>",Lower gasoline prices restrain U.S. consumer inflation,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices were unchanged for a third straight month in January, leading to the smallest annual increase in inflation in more than 1-1/2 years, which could allow the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady for a while.
The Labor Department's report on Wednesday supported the Fed's recent description of price pressures being ""muted."" In a policy statement last month, the U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged, pledged to be ""patient"" before tightening monetary policy further and discarded promises of ""further gradual increases"" in borrowing costs.
""Inflation still appears to be well in check,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""That should be enough for the Fed to take time to evaluate the gradual effects of its prior rate hikes and move more slowly and thoughtfully in administering rate policy in the months ahead.""
The Consumer Price Index last month was held down by cheaper gasoline, which offset increases in the cost of food, rent, healthcare, recreation, apparel, motor vehicles and household furnishings. In the 12 months through January, the CPI rose 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since June 2017. The CPI increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in December.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.2 percent, rising by the same margin for a fifth straight month. In the 12 months through January, the so-called core CPI rose 2.2 percent for a third straight month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1 percent in January and the core CPI rising 0.2 percent.
While the steady increases in core inflation resulted in the biggest three-month annualized gain in 10 months, economists said they did not believe it signaled a material shift in underlying inflation trends.
""The Fed will be focused more on longer time frames,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York. ""The quarter-on-quarter annualized figure has moved both higher and lower without signaling any meaningful change in the year-on-year rate before.""
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies as traders focused on the three-month rise in the core CPI. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher amid optimism that the United States and China could strike a deal during trade talks in Beijing. 
LITTLE UPSIDE RISK 
Despite the increases in the core CPI, underlying inflation remains moderate. The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy.
The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in November after rising 1.8 percent in October. It hit 2 percent in March 2018 for the first time since April 2012. PCE price data for December will be released on March 1.
It was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. 
Inflation is remaining moderate despite a tightening labor market, in part because of slowing economic growth in China and Europe, which is helping to lower oil prices.
""We don't see a ton of upside risk to inflation over the next several months,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The unemployment rate could fall even further without stoking significant inflation, since the slope of the Phillips curve remains flat.""
The Phillips curve describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment. It holds that as unemployment declines, inflation should rise. In the current environment, the lack of a strong inflation impulse suggests there is no danger of the labor market overheating.
In January, gasoline prices fell 5.5 percent after dropping 5.8 percent in December. Food prices increased 0.2 percent, rising for a third straight month. There were increases in the prices of poultry, eggs, fish and beef. But consumers paid less for fruits, vegetables, cereals and dairy products.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent in January after gaining 0.2 percent in the prior month. The cost of postage stamps jumped 1.7 percent, the most since February 2013.
Healthcare costs rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in December, with doctor visits costing more. Apparel prices surged 1.1 percent last month, the biggest increase since February 2018. 

Airline fares dropped 0.9 percent. The cost of motor vehicle insurance fell for a third straight month.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 09:45AM ET</span>",French wine and spirits exports shrug off weak China to hit record in 2018,"PARIS (Reuters) - French wine and spirits exports topped 13 billion euros ($14.7 billion) for the first time in 2018 even though shipments to China fell sharply as its economy slowed and trade tensions rose, exporters group FEVS said on Wednesday.
Sales abroad of wines and spirits -- France's second-biggest export after aerospace -- rose 2.4 percent in value to a new record of 13.2 billion euros, the Federation of French Wines and Spirit Exporters said.
A premium branding strategy in the Cognac, Champagne and Bordeaux sector compensated for a historically poor harvest in 2017, which lead to a 2.7 percent fall in exported volumes.
The main driver of the rise was the United States, where sales reached 3.2 billion euros, up 4.6 percent on 2017. The U.S. market is by far the largest overseas for French wines and spirits, representing nearly a quarter of all such exports. 
In contrast, exports to China tumbled 14.4 percent in 2018 to 1 billion euros after growing 24.5 percent a year earlier.
That fall was largely offset by an 8.3 percent rise in exports to Singapore, at 901 million euros, and to Hong Kong, up 12.3 percent at 556 million euros. Both cities are used as logistics hubs to supply the Chinese market, FEVS Chairman Antoine Leccia told Reuters.
""Taking into account these hubs that are Hong Kong and Singapore, exports are almost stable,"" he said.
Large French cognac groups like  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) (Martell), LVMH (Hennessy) and Remy Cointreau (Remy Martin) have reported strong sales to China last year.
Wine exports dropped 4.6 percent in volume after repeated bad weather including frosts and storms cut output to a record low in 2017 but lower availability pushed up prices, so that exports gained 2.6 percent in value to 8.9 billion euros.
Spirits exports continued to grow, with sales up 1.8 percent to 4.3 billion euros, still driven by cognac, exports of which rose 1.7 percent in value last year to 3.1 billion euros. That was nevertheless much slower than the 10.8 percent growth posted a year earlier.
Looking ahead, wine and spirits exporters remain confident despite international trade turmoil and uncertainty about Britain's impending exit from the European Union. 
""Exports are expected to rise again in China and the United States have remarkable fundamentals,"" Leccia said.
Like many others French wine and spirits exporters have been preparing for an abrupt no-deal Brexit by building up stockpiles in Britain. Some have reserves to last until September, six month after the country is due to leave the EU.
Every day, about 200 wine and spirits trucks are crossing the border between France and the UK, Leccia said.

168,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. Inflation Remains Contained Amid Fed Patience on Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- A key measure of U.S. inflation was little changed in January while the broader gauge slowed on lower energy costs, underscoring the Federal Reserve's recent decision to be patient on raising interest rates.
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core consumer price index rose 0.2 percent from the prior month and 2.2 percent from a year earlier, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday. The monthly pace matched the median estimate of economists. The broader CPI was unchanged from December, below forecasts, while the annual gain of 1.6 percent was the smallest since June 2017.
The data suggest inflation remains around the Fed’s 2 percent target, with prices getting a lift from steady wage gains. Fed officials have signaled a pause on raising rates amid global growth risks and headwinds from trade.
A separate Labor Department report on Wednesday illustrated how prices are affecting consumers: average hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, increased 1.7 percent in January from a year earlier, the biggest increase since mid-2016, reflecting the slowdown in the main inflation gauge.
Since raising rates in December for a fourth and final time in 2018, Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the central bank have pledged to be patient in deliberating another increase.
Powell signaled at his last press conference in late January that borrowing costs are unlikely to rise until inflation accelerates. “I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and for me, a big part of that would be inflation,” he said. “It wouldn’t be the only thing, but it would certainly be important.”
While policy makers projected two 2019 rate hikes at their December meeting, investors expect no moves for the whole year, according to pricing in rate futures. Economists see one interest-rate increase this year, cutting their estimates from as many as three more expected in November, according to a Bloomberg News survey this month.
Release of December data for the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge -- a separate measure tied to consumption -- was delayed by the government shutdown. The gauges tend to run slightly below the Labor Department’s CPI measures.
Wednesday’s CPI report had a few quirks, including a 1.1 percent rise in apparel prices that was the biggest in almost a year. Energy prices also had an outsize impact on the headline number with a 3.1 percent monthly drop that was the most in almost three years.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 05:53AM ET</span>","UK inflation falls to two-year low, offering households help before Brexit","By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation fell to a two-year low in January, dipping below the Bank of England's target and offering some relief to householders who have tightened their belts ahead of Brexit.
Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in January after a 2.1 percent increase in December, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast 1.9 percent.
British consumers have been pressured by inflation after a slump in sterling of more than 10 percent against the dollar and euro since the Brexit referendum in June 2016. 
Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1 percent in November 2017, when British households faced much greater price increases than the European Union average. 
That difference is now negligible but economists say higher inflation could return in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
""The further falling back in inflation facilitates the Bank of England maintaining a 'wait and see' approach on interest rates until after the UK leaves the EU,"" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club consultancy, said.
Last week the BoE said inflation was likely to fall below 2.0 percent in coming months, in part reflecting a fall in oil prices.
Sterling was little changed against the dollar and euro following the data but UK government bond prices rose, pushing 10-year yields down by 2 basis points.
Despite the fall in inflation since late 2017 and wages growing at their fastest in a decade, businesses have reported a downturn in consumer spending in recent months. 
Surveys show households are worried about the outlook for 2019, with Britain on course for a no-deal departure from the EU on March 29 unless Prime Minister Theresa May can broker a revised deal with the EU that would be accepted by her divided party and parliament.
January's fall in inflation was due mainly to cheaper energy, ""partly offset by rising ferry ticket prices and air fares falling more slowly than this time last year,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said.
The ONS figures also suggested less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.
Among manufacturers, the cost of raw materials was 2.9 percent higher than in January 2018. 
That marked the slowest annual increase since June 2016, the month of the Brexit referendum. Economists polled by Reuters had expected input prices to rise by 3.8 percent.
Still, household face the prospect of higher bills for essentials. On Wednesday npower became the third of Britain's top six energy providers this week to raise prices, following the announcement of a new, higher price cap from the regulator.

Separately, the ONS said UK house prices in December rose by an annual 2.5 percent, the smallest increase since July 2013. Prices in London alone fell for a sixth month running, down 0.6 percent on the year.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent monthly fall and a 3.2 year-on-year decline.
Eurostat said the production of capital goods, like machinery, fell by 1.5 percent in December against November and year on year the fall was 5.5 percent, accelerating from 4.4 percent in November.

The fall in industrial production and the decline in the output of capital goods underline the trend of slowing economic growth in the euro zone where the European Commission expects growth to decelerate to 1.3 percent this year from 1.9 in 2018.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 04:56AM ET</span>","Swedish central bank holds rates, hedges prospects of 2019 hike","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank held interest rates on Wednesday and said it aimed to raise them in the second half of the year, though doubts about the strength of economic growth and inflation could cause a rethink.
At its previous meeting in December, the Riksbank raised its benchmark repo rate for the first time in more than seven years, arguing that with inflation back on a firm footing, it could begin gradually tightening policy. 
Holding the rate at -0.25 percent as expected, it said little had changed since then but cautioned that further hikes were conditional on the data outlook remaining sufficiently robust.
""There is uncertainty over developments abroad and the strength of domestic demand,"" the central bank said in a statement. ""It is the economic outlook and inflation prospects that will determine future monetary policy.""
The Riksbank kept its forecasts for inflation and growth roughly unchanged. Analysts had expected downgrades, and the Swedish crown strengthened after the decision.
Some analysts believe downgrades will still happen, and doubt the durability of a forecast of two rate hikes a year that the Riksbank repeated on Wednesday.
Nordea said that, while it still expected another hike in December, that was dependent on the European Central Bank tightening policy as well.
""It is extremely uncertain whether the ECB will hike ... so it could take a long time before the Riksbank hikes rates again,"" Nordea economist Torbjorn Isaksson said.
Data suggests Europe's economy is slowing, and Brexit and a persistent trade spat between the United States and China are adding to uncertainties.
Most analysts polled by Reuters before Wednesday's decision expected rate-setters to fulfill their plans and hike again in the second half of the year. But many saw a downside risk to the forecast if inflation disappointed or the ECB followed the U.S. Federal Reserve by taking a dovish turn.
Deputy Riksbank Governor Per Jansson, who voted against the rate hike in December, was absent from Wednesday's meeting.

173,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>",U.K. Annual Inflation Hits Two-Year Low of 1.8%,"Investing.com - The annual rate of inflation in the U.K. dropped to 1.8% in January according to data released on Wednesday, its lowest level since Dec. 2016 and below the Bank of England's target.
January’s inflation reading was down from 2.1% the month before and was also below forecasts for a drop to 1.9%. The BoE targets inflation of 2%.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, rose by an annualized 1.9% last month the Office for National Statistics said, in line with forecasts and matching the previous month.
""The fall in inflation is due mainly to cheaper gas, electricity and petrol, partly offset by rising ferry ticket prices and air fares falling more slowly than this time last year,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said.
The slowdown in inflation underlines the case for the BoE to hold off for now on further policy tightening amid the political crisis surrounding the U.K.’s departure from the European Union. But analysts believe that there is still room to hike later this year and the Bank itself repeated last week that the next move in interest rates could be up as well as down.
The drop in inflation follows data out this week that showed the British economy grew at the slowest pace since 2012 last year, as concerns over Brexit and a wider global economic slowdown dragged on confidence and businesses reduced investment.
Traders widely expect the U.K.’s central bank to make no changes to interest rates until uncertainty from the Brexit process is resolved.
Earlier this week, BoE governor Mark Carney said stable global growth is more likely than a recession but highlighted some risks to the outlook, including growing debt in China and a reduction in the world's openness to trade.
He further indicated that Brexit could be the ‘acid test’ of whether the world can combine the benefits of economic openness with greater democratic accountability.
“Provided the expansion continues, a modest tightening of monetary policy over time will likely be sufficient to achieve inflation targets. Policy can remain limited and gradual, as well as data-dependent,” Carney stated.
While analysts remain cautious, they also have yet to rule out that the British central bank could tighten rates this year.
“Assuming an amicable outcome to the Brexit negotiations, there are enough hawkish signals in the inflation report to conclude that the BoE could hike rates later this year, which should support the currency,” Marc-André Fongern, FX strategist at MAF Global Forex, said.
James Smith, Developed Markets economist at ING, thinks the BoE is highly unlikely to tighten policy again through the first half of this year and notes that the chances of a rate hike at all in 2019 have receded, “but we think it’s too early to write one off completely,” he said, highlighting the fact that everything depends on the Brexit outcome.
“Most paths now lead to an extension of the Article 50 negotiating period, but if (and it's still a big if) the government can secure a cross-party consensus for a particular deal – for instance one that commits to a permanent customs union – then this may well be followed up with a Bank of England rate hike relatively swiftly,” Smith added.
Separately, the ONS said house prices in December rose by an annual 2.5% across the U.K. as a whole, the smallest increase since July 2013 and compared with 2.7% in November. Prices in London alone fell for a sixth month running, down 0.6% on the year.

174,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 01:04AM ET</span>","More tourists visit Singapore, but spending growth slows","By Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore received a record 18.5 million visitors last year as more tourists arrived in the city-state from its top markets such as China and India, but growth in their spending slowed as they cut back on shopping, data showed on Wednesday.
Tourism receipts rose 1 percent to S$27.1 billion ($20 billion) in 2018, based on preliminary estimates. That was slower than a 4 percent rise in the previous year as tourists shopped less on items like gifts and souvenirs.
Singapore saw a 6.2 percent rise in travellers in 2018 from the year earlier, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said. Arrivals from China, its biggest market, rose 6 percent to 3.4 million, while those from India, another major market, rose 13 percent to 1.4 million.
The data tracks a global trend of increased travelling but reduced spending, according to the STB. Tourists' spending power was also hit by a stronger Singapore dollar versus some other currencies.
The board forecast visitor arrivals of 18.7 million to 19.2 million for 2019, a rise of 1-4 percent. It expects a 1-3 percent growth in tourism receipts at S$27.3 billion to S$27.9 billion this year.
The STB said challenges in 2019 included competition from regional destinations, as well as a potential slowdown in outbound travel from China as trade tensions with the United States hit sentiment in a slowing economy. 
""We are still forecasting growth from China this year. It will probably be a little bit more moderate compared to past years,"" said Keith Tan, chief executive of the STB.
Singapore, which relies on tourism for about 4 percent of its economic output, is famed for its glitzy shopping malls, hawker food, casinos and the Formula One night race. It has long been a popular well-connected destination for corporate travellers as well as holidaymakers, many of whom use it as a stopover to other popular spots in Southeast Asia.

Last year, Singapore won added publicity after it hosted an unprecedented meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 'Crazy Rich Asians' - the Hollywood hit film set in Singapore - was another boost to the city-state's image.

175,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>",Worst Korean Jobs Figures in Nine Years Undermine Moon's Agenda,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s jobless rate hit the highest level in nine years, adding to evidence that President Moon Jae-in’s minimum wage hikes are doing more to harm employment growth than they are to raise incomes.
The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate reached 4.4 percent in January, the worst figure since January 2010, when it was 4.7 percent. The median forecast of economists was for 3.8 percent. Meanwhile, jobs growth slowed to 19,000, down from 34,000 jobs in December.
Moon’s administration hiked the minimum wage by 11 percent this year, following a 16 percent increase last year.
While few people disagree with the goal of raising wages, the very aggressive hikes have been criticized by business and economists for making it more difficult to employ people. More vulnerable small businesses have been among the most badly affected.
Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki early this month attributed the weak jobs data to the base effect from a larger number of new jobs created a year earlier. Hong’s predecessor Kim Dong-yeon was replaced late last year in a shakeup of senior officials to try to stem a backlash over Moon’s income-led growth policy.

176,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 03:42PM ET</span>",Greenspan Warns of ‘Extremely Imbalanced’ Path of U.S. Deficit,"(Bloomberg) -- While American politicians on both sides of the aisle have been mostly silent as the U.S. deficit swells toward $1 trillion and beyond, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says the lack of attention won’t last.
“This is an extremely imbalanced situation,” Greenspan, who led the Fed from 1987 to 2006, said in a phone interview. “Politically, budget deficits really don’t matter. What matters is the consequences.”
For Greenspan, 92, the ultimate concern is inflation. The last time the nation had to plug a shortfall this large was in the wake of the recession that ended in 2009. Now the economy is in its 10th year of expansion, with the tightest job market since the 1960s.
Inflation is under control -- data Wednesday may show it’s the tamest since 2016. But should investors start to worry that U.S. spending will spur price pressures, they could curtail purchases of Treasuries at a time when a key source of demand -- international buyers -- is already waning.
“It is only when eventually the budget deficits, as they always do, engender inflation that you get the political system responding,” Greenspan said. “We see right now the beginnings of stagflation, but we are not there yet,” he said, referring to a mix of slow growth and high inflation.
The federal deficit will exceed $1 trillion in fiscal 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In Donald Trump’s first full fiscal year as president, the shortfall grew to $779 billion, the highest since 2012, even as tax cuts boosted growth. Deficits were already on course to worsen amid rising outlays for entitlements and interest expenses.
The deteriorating fiscal backdrop combined with the Fed’s move to shrink its balance sheet led the Treasury to boost net issuance to $1.34 trillion in 2018, more than double the level of 2017. Beth Hammack, chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, said in a report to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month that U.S. borrowing needs may tally more than $12 trillion over the next decade.
While fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill seem few and far between, investors and business leaders are raising red flags.
Although so far the U.S. has avoided having to offer higher yields as it ramps up borrowing, Mark Kiesel of Pacific Investment Management Co. says that won’t last. That’s because foreign demand is ebbing, and he sees more upside than downside risk to inflation. DoubleLine Capital LP’s Jeffrey Gundlach has also sounded alarm bells, calling the increased debt load a “horrific situation.”
Parties’ ‘Failure’
Former  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering running for president in 2020 as an independent, last month said the debt overhang is an example of both major parties’ “reckless failure” regarding their constitutional responsibility.
Greenspan’s view is that unfunded entitlement spending will crowd out private-sector investment and curtail growth. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sounded a similar note last month, saying “the U.S. federal government budget is on an unsustainable path,” given rising health-care costs and an aging population.
“Entitlements crowd out gross domestic savings, and domestic savings coupled with savings borrowed from abroad is the fundamental source of funding for capital investment,” Greenspan said. “And capital investment is the basis for productivity growth.”

177,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 02:33PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings hit record high; workers more scarce,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in December, led by vacancies in the construction and accommodation and food services sectors, strengthening analysts' views that the economy was running out of workers.
While the release of the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, on Tuesday underscored labor market strength, there are worries the shortage of workers could hurt an economic expansion that has lasted 9-1/2 years and is the second longest on record.
""The labor market continues to heat up,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""But growth cannot continue for much longer if there is no one out there to work in the factories and shops and malls across America.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 169,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.3 million in December, the highest reading since the series started in 2000. That lifted the job openings rate to 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent in November.
Construction vacancies increased by 88,000 jobs in December. There were an additional 84,000 jobs in the accommodation and food services sector. Job openings in the healthcare and social assistance sector rose by 79,000 in December. 
Federal government vacancies, however, fell by 32,000 jobs and job openings in real estate, rental and leasing dropped 31,000 in December.
Hiring continued to lag job openings in December, rising to 5.9 million from 5.8 million in November. That further widened the gap between vacancies and hiring, which emerged in 2015, reflecting tightening labor market conditions. There were 1.2 job openings for every unemployed person in December.
ROBUST LABOR MARKET
Anecdotal evidence has been growing of companies experiencing difficulties finding workers. A survey of small businesses published on Tuesday found that almost a quarter of owners reported that difficulties finding qualified workers as their ""single most important business problem"" in January.
According to the survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, 35 percent of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in January. 
The labor market has enjoyed a record 100 straight months of job gains, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 304,000 jobs in January, the most since February 2018. But as workers become more scarce, job growth is expected to slow to around 150,000 per month this year.
Economists believe the dearth of workers will drive up wage growth, even though the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs has remained steady.
""The diminishing availability of workers is expected to lead to more upward pressure on wages, bring more workers into the labor force and induce more companies to find ways to produce and service their customers with automated processes,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The JOLTS report showed the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs was little changed at 3.5 million in December, keeping the quits rate at 2.3 percent for a third straight month. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence.
There were increases in the number of workers quitting their jobs in professional and business services and in the health care and social assistance sectors. But these were offset by declines in several industries and the government.
""With a labor market this tight, you may expect the quits rate to be going up or at a higher level already,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""The big question is whether this a temporary lull, or if the quits rate has hit its high point.""

Layoffs fell in December, pushing the layoffs rate down to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent in November.

The National Federation of Independent Business said on Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 3.2 points to 101.2 in January, the weakest reading since November 2016. 
The index surged after Trump's electoral victory, boosted by his administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package and deregulation policy. It has declined for five straight months since hitting an all-time high last August, but remains high by historic standards.
Still, the index mirrored other confidence surveys, which weakened sharply last month.
""We believe the apparent boost to the survey data from increased partisanship since the 2016 election is starting to fade,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
The NFIB said its uncertainty index jumped 7 points to 86 last month, the fifth highest reading in the survey's 45-year history. The rise in uncertainty coincided with the longest partial shutdown of the federal government in history.
The 35-day shutdown ended on Jan. 25 after Trump and Congress agreed to temporary government funding, without money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. 

The NFIB said ""there is more talk about recession risk. It noted that small business owners worried ""about future sales growth, some weakness in business conditions later in the year and some deterioration in conditions that would be supportive of business expansion.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's consumer prices rose at a milder pace than anticipated in January and remained below the central bank's target for a sixth straight month, strengthening views it could again cut the key interest rate at its next policy review in April.
Annual retail inflation in January rose 2.05 percent, its slowest pace since June 2017, government data showed on Tuesday.
Economists in a Reuters poll predicted retail inflation would edge up to 2.48 percent in January from the downward revised December figure of 2.11 percent.
The decline was due to a fall in food prices and smaller increases in fuel costs.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast January's annual increase in the consumer price index at 2.48 percent. 
Figures released separately on Tuesday showed industrial output growth rose 2.4 percent in December on the year.
In a surprise move on Feb. 7, the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the benchmark repo rate 25 basis points to 6.25 percent, in its first cut in 18 months, and hinted of more room to cut rates.
The MPC, which mainly monitors retail inflation data, also revised down its inflation projections for the period from April to September to 3.2 percent to 3.4 percent, from 3.8 percent to 4.2 percent. 
Inflation pressures have eased in recent months, following falls in food and crude oil prices. India imports nearly 80 percent of oil it consumes.
The retail inflation number was much lower than the market expectations, said Tushar Arora, a senior economist at HDFC Bank.
""This reinforces expectations of a rate cut in April,"" he added.
India's economy is slowing, hit by reduced growth in consumer spending and in the farm sector.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces tough general elections by May, has announced an annual transfer of 750 billion rupees ($11 billion) to millions of farmers, and tax benefits for the middle class, which many economists say could spur both consumer spending and inflation. 
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has downplayed the risk India could soon see higher inflation because of bigger budget spending, and has said the MPC would only look at the headline inflation number and ignore core inflation, which has stayed stubbornly high.
Core consumer inflation, which strips out food and fuel prices, was estimated at about 5.4 percent in January, slightly softer than a downward revised December figure of 5.6 percent, according to an estimate made by two analysts from inflation figures released on Tuesday.
Retail food prices fell 2.17 percent in January from a year earlier, compared to revised fall of 2.65 percent a month earlier. The figures show rural incomes remain under pressure while consumers benefit from easing inflation. 
A Reuters poll after the MPC's Feb. 7 rate cut showed a slim majority of economists see another rate cut before the election.

This year, other major central banks have also changed to a dovish stance in the face of rising worries about global growth and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's trade surplus with the United States, a frequent source of tension with U.S. President Donald Trump, declined last year but nonetheless remained at around 49 billion euros ($55.37 billion), data seen by Reuters showed on Monday.
Trump has frequently criticized the large trade surplus that Europe's biggest economy has with the United States and has threatened to put tariffs on German cars in return.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel has questioned Trump's analysis, saying that trade surpluses were calculated in an old-fashioned way and that the United States runs a large account surplus with Europe if services are included in the total.
In June, Merkel suggested that existing international trade accounting systems should be updated.
Preliminary calculations from the Federal Statistics Office showed that German exports to the United States rose by 1.5 percent to a record high of 113.5 billion euros in 2018.
That meant the United States remained the biggest buyer of ""Made in Germany"" goods -- ahead of France, which purchased 105 billion euros' worth, and China, which bought 93 billion euros' worth.
German imports from the United States increased by around 4 percent to 64.6 billion euros.
That meant the surplus with the United States was around a billion euros smaller than in 2017. But it was still the largest surplus Germany has with any country and accounts for more than a fifth of Germany's overall export surplus of around 228 billion euros in 2018.
China remained Germany's most important trade partner in 2018, with the two countries exchanging goods worth almost 200 billion euros.
German exports to China increased by around 8 percent to 93 billion euros last year while imports from China rose by around 4 percent to 106 billion euros.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy slowed sharply in late 2018, pushing full-year growth to its weakest in six years as Brexit worries hammered investment by companies and the global economic slowdown weighed on trade, official data showed on Monday.
The pace of economic growth fell to a quarterly rate of 0.2 percent between October and December from 0.6 percent in the previous quarter, in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll, while output in December alone dropped by the most since 2016. 
""The UK economy lost its summer exuberance in the final months of 2018, and there are signs of further chill winds ahead,"" economist Tej Parikh at the Institute of Directors said.
Sterling fell by a third of a cent to below $1.29. 
For 2018 as a whole, growth dropped to its lowest since 2012 at 1.4 percent, down from 1.8 percent in 2017. 
Exports suffered from global weakness and consumers and businesses grew increasingly concerned about the lack of a plan for when Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29.
Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to win parliament's backing for the plan she agreed with Brussels to avoid reimposing checks on goods exported from Britain.
Major economies around the world also slowed in late 2018, due in part to trade tensions between the United States and China, while Brexit is an added challenge for Britain.
Last week the Bank of England chopped its forecast for growth this year by 0.5 percentage points to 1.2 percent, which would be the weakest year since the 2009 recession.
Monday's data showed net trade lopped more than 0.1 percentage points from the fourth-quarter growth rate. Falling business investment did similar damage.
""GDP slowed in the last three months of the year with the manufacturing of cars and steel products seeing steep falls and construction also declining,"" Office for National Statistics statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
In December alone, the economy contracted by 0.4 percent, the biggest fall since March 2016.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said the data showed the economy remained ""fundamentally strong"" and that public-sector forecasters did not foresee a recession.
Business investment dropped 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, the biggest fall since the first three months of 2010, when Britain was emerging from recession. Investment has contracted for four consecutive quarters, the longest run since the third quarter of 2009.
Household spending - which offered an unexpectedly strong boost to growth in mid-2018 - remained resilient, up 1.9 percent on a year ago, as did government spending.
Overall, business investment has stalled since June 2016's referendum, which the BoE blames for stagnating economic productivity.

The BoE expects business and housing investment to fall this year, and for export growth to halve.

In a report, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product expanded by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in the October to December period.
That was below forecasts of a 0.3% rise and compared to growth of 0.6% in the third quarter.
Year-over-year, UK economic growth expanded 1.3% in the fourth quarter, its weakest growth since the second quarter of 2012 and also below estimates for growth of 1.4%. The British economy grew 1.6% in the third quarter.
“Two and a half years since the UK voted to leave the European Union, the country’s post-Brexit position remains far from clear,” James Smith, research director at Resolution Foundation, said. “As we approach ‘Brexit day’ on 29 March, politicians in all parties needs to recognize how much is at stake for family living standards and that how the country goes forward, not just where it is heading, matters for household incomes in the here and now.”
“The economy is now 12% larger than before the financial crisis with output up 19% since the 2009 trough,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. “Unfortunately, Brexit uncertainty and global protectionism fears suggest 2019 will be a much tougher year.”

Those who are still shopping are increasingly doing it online, with JD.com reporting a 43 percent jump in sales around the holiday versus a year earlier. Cellphones, computers and home appliances were at the top of shopping lists, and there was a surge in purchases of kitchenware and furniture, according to a report from the second largest e-commerce site in the nation.
Spending growth in smaller cities jumped 55 percent on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Tmall, faster than in major metropolises, where residents are being squeezed by higher housing prices. Tourists chose Hong Kong, Thailand and Macau as their top overseas destinations, according to Alibaba’s online tourism site. The U.S. was the seventh most popular spot, even amid the trade tensions.
China mainland visitors to Macau reached almost 900,000 during the week-long Chinese New Year holiday, climbing 26 percent from last year’s festive holiday, according to Macau’s tourism office. That was more than double last year’s growth.
The week-long Lunar New Year falls on different dates in January or February each year. During the holiday, hundreds of millions travel to their hometowns or go overseas, visit relatives and dine out. This year’s holiday was Feb. 4-10, while it was Feb. 15-21 in 2018.

The annual figures -- showing that Germany had exported 1.3 trillion euros' worth of goods and imported 1.1 trillion euros -- exceeded the previous record set in 2017. The trade surplus for the year narrowed slightly.
Germany, the continent's economic motor, has boomed for a decade thanks to its role as a supplier of equipment to the world's industrial nations. That makes it vulnerable to a possible trade war between China and the United States, which has taken a more protectionist stance under President Donald Trump.
But the latest monthly figures, showing unexpected month-on-month growth in both exports and imports, appeared to snap a long run of gloomy economic indicators, possibly indicating that the economy's long-expected slowdown may yet be postponed.
Seasonally adjusted exports rose 1.5 percent month-on-month - up from a 0.4 percent fall in the previous month, and confounding forecasts of 0.2 percent growth. Imports meanwhile rose 1.2 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent decline in the previous month.
That meant the trade surplus widened to 19.4 billion euros from 18.4 billion euros the month before.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>","Japan's modest household spending, wages growth point to fragile outlook","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rose slightly and higher bonus payments lifted wages in December, though the underlying trends in these two gauges showed only modest improvement and pointed to a difficult year for the economy as risks to growth increases. 
Recent revelations that faulty polling methods were used to compile monthly wage data have also cast doubt on whether the benefits of Japan's economic recovery have broadened as much as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says.
Household spending was up 0.1 percent in December from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, marking the first increase in four months but still well short of a median market forecast for a 0.8 percent increase.
Separate data showed inflation-adjusted real wages rose 1.4 percent in December, though the gain was mostly due to an increase in winter bonuses. Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, rose at a slower 0.9 percent pace in the year to December, from a 1.3 percent increase in November.
Many analysts see a gloomy outlook as slowing global demand, trade protectionism and volatile markets give companies plenty of excuses to put off further wage hikes.
""When you look at the October-December quarter, consumption fared fairly well and will probably contribute positively to gross domestic product (GDP) growth,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""But companies may not raise wages much this year because there is so much uncertainty on the global economy,"" he said. ""There's a small but likely chance the economy may contract again in January-March.""
DATA SCANDAL 
Analysts say consumption held up in the final months of 2018 as falling gasoline and vegetable costs lifted households' purchasing power.
Household spending rose 0.2 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, underscoring market expectations the economy likely rebounded from a third-quarter contraction blamed on bad weather and a string of natural disasters. The government will release October-December GDP data on Feb. 14.
But there is uncertainty on whether there will be a sufficient boost in consumption to offset weakness in exports, as slowing global demand and U.S.-Sino trade frictions hurt business sentiment.
Exports in December fell the most in more than two years, heightening the chance Japan could slide into recession this year. Manufacturing growth also stalled in January as companies cut back production.
Mounting external risks add to the challenge facing the Bank of Japan, which is left with diminished policy ammunition to fight another recession after years of heavy money printing failed to drive up inflation to its elusive 2 percent target.
""Consumption may lose momentum this year as household income isn't rising quickly enough,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
A scandal over faulty polling methods for Japan's wage data is also forcing Abe to defend his view that his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies have improved living standards for many households.
The labor ministry said last month the monthly wage data it published for more than a decade employed faulty polling methods and did not accurately depict the nationwide wage trend.
The government is expected to recalculate the data later this month. A Reuters calculation showed real wages from January to November 2018 fell 0.4 percent from the year-earlier period, more than a 0.1 percent drop under the labor ministry's data.
The premier's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies have boosted corporate profits by lifting stocks and giving exporters a competitive advantage overseas through a weaker yen.
But they have failed to fire up private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), as companies remain reluctant to raise wages.

""As trade frictions heighten uncertainty over the growth outlook, businesses won't raise base pay much this year and households will become more cautious about spending,"" Norinchukin Research Institute's Minami said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped from near a 1-1/2-year high last week, but the decline was less than expected, suggesting some moderation in the pace of job growth.
Still, the Labor Department's report on Thursday continued to point to strong job market conditions, which should underpin the economy amid rising headwinds, including a fading fiscal stimulus boost and a trade war between Washington and Beijing, as well as slowing growth in China and Europe.
The Federal Reserve last week kept interest rates steady but said it would be patient in lifting borrowing costs further this year in a nod to growing uncertainty over the economy's outlook. The U.S. central bank removed language from its December policy statement that risks to the outlook were ""roughly balanced."" 
""Labor market conditions remain quite positive, good news for workers, for the consumer sector and the economy more broadly,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Feb. 2, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The drop partially unwound the prior week's jump, which lifted claims to 253,000, the highest reading since September 2017.
Claims that week were boosted by layoffs in the service industry in California, most likely striking teachers in Los Angeles. 
A 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government as well as difficulties adjusting the data around moving holidays like Martin Luther King Jr. day, which occurred later this year than in recent years, also probably contributed to the spike in filings.
The longest shutdown in history likely forced workers employed by government contractors to file claims for unemployment benefits. 
The shutdown ended on Jan. 25 after President Donald Trump and Congress agreed to temporary government funding, without money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 221,000 in the latest week. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower on renewed fears of a global slowdown after the European Union cut its economic growth forecasts and White House adviser Larry Kudlow warned there was still a sizable distance to go on U.S.-China trade talks. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MOMENTUM SLOWING
The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,500 to 224,750 last week. Claims by federal government workers, which are filed separately and with a one-week lag fell 8,070 to 6,669 in the week ended Jan. 26.
""Claims remain important to watch in the weeks ahead,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""The data are suggesting at least some slowing in employment growth.""
The government reported last Friday that non-farm payrolls increased by 304,000 jobs in January, the largest gain since February 2018. Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 42,000 to 1.74 million for the week ended Jan. 26. 

These so-called continuing claims had raced to a nine-month high in the prior week. The four-week moving average of continuing claims rose 4,250 to 1.74 million.

The bank noted that U.K. economic growth slowed in late 2018 and “appears to have weakened further in early 2019. This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home.” 
With just 50 days until the deadline for the U.K. to leave the EU, the economy is showing clear signs of slowing down, as uncertainty leads companies to put off investment decisions, while a steady stream of unsettling political headlines weighs on consumer confidence.
The slowdown has put the Bank’s decision in August to raise its key refinancing rate to 0.75% in an unflattering light.
Data on Tuesday showed that companies in Britain are cutting jobs for the first time in six years as the economy stalls. The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers’ Index, fell to 50.1 in January from 51.2 in December, which was its lowest level since July 2016.
Construction and services PMIs also fell in January, IHS/Markit said.
Inflation has also retreated in line with the drop in oil prices at the end of last year. From a peak of 3.1% at the end of 2017, it stood at only 2.1% in December.
“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond,” the BoE stressed in its press release. 
However, the base case scenario in the Bank's quarterly inflation report, also published Thursday, assumed that the current slowdown is likely to be only temporary. The Bank said:
The Bank also repeated its conclusion from the previous statement that : “The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction.”
Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to convince EU leaders to renegotiate a key part of the withdrawal agreement, but the bloc has signalled it won't reopen a deal that took two years to negotiate.
May faces strong opposition from her Conservative Party, who want reassurance that the so-called ‘Irish backstop’ arrangements won’t leave the country effectively under EU laws in the long term.
The Bank’s messaging comes as both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank adopt a more cautious tone about the global economic outlook. The Fed signaled in January that it would pause its tightening of monetary policy, while the ECB expressed fears of downside risks to the economy amid weak data from Germany and fears of a recession in Italy."
195,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:03AM ET</span>","German industrial output falls, raising risk of recession","By Joseph Nasr and Klaus Lauer
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output unexpectedly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month, sending another signal that growth in Europe's biggest economy is weakening.
Data from the Federal Statistics Office on Thursday showed industrial output was down by 0.4 percent, confounding a Reuters forecast for an increase of 0.7 percent.
Analysts said the fall makes it more likely that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter, which would translate into a recession after growth domestic product fell in the third quarter.
After nearly a decade of steady growth, the German economy has been facing headwinds from trade frictions between the United States and both China and the European Union. Britain's possible departure from the EU next month without a deal is also clouding the outlook for German manufacturers.
December's drop in industrial output was led by the construction sector, where activity shrank by more than 4 percent, which could not be offset by a small rise in manufacturing output, a breakdown of the data showed.
The economy ministry said the auto sector, which has been a drag on the economy because new emissions standards translated into fewer new vehicle registrations, rebounded in December as output rose by more than 7 percent. 
The figure for November was revised up to a fall of 1.3 percent from a previously reported drop of 1.9 percent.
""A positive GDP reading in the fourth quarter of 2018 now looks tight,"" said Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank Group. ""A positive (industry) reading would have reduced the chance of a negative GDP reading in the fourth quarter.""
MALAISE SPREADING
Growing signs of a slowdown have prompted the government to revise down its growth forecast for this year to 1 percent.
Industry groups and economists have said complacency on the economy from Chancellor Angela Merkel is also contributing to the slowdown.
They have urged her to grant families and businesses more generous tax cuts, and enact tax reforms that give women and the long-term unemployed more incentives to join the workforce. Merkel is also facing calls to make Germany more attractive to foreign workers to plug critical labor shortages.
Weaker growth or stagnation in Germany could have implications for the whole euro zone, whose largest economy acts as a bellwether of the economic health of the single currency bloc.
Private consumption has been providing impetus for the German economy as exports weaken, but economists suspect the slowdown in manufacturing has been spreading to services firms who depend mostly on the domestic market for growth.
Those suspicions were confirmed by the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce, which on Thursday revised down its growth forecast for this year to 0.9 percent from 1.7 percent.

The disappointing output data came after separate figures released on Wednesday showed that industrial orders had unexpectedly fallen for the second month in a row in December.

The Commission highlighted the slowdown in China’s growth momentum and uncertainty surrounding the trade talks between the U.S. and China as the major risks weighing on the short-term outlook.
The EU now expects growth of 1.3% in 2019, compared to its prior November projection of 1.9%, and a 1.6% expansion for 2020, compared to the previous forecast of 2.0%.
The updated estimate for the current year is even lower that the 1.6% forecast by the International Monetary Fund or the 1.7% projected by the European Central Bank at its December meeting. The IMF and the ECB had both estimated that the euro area economy would grow by 1.7% in 2020.
The largest impact came from reductions in the forecast for German growth to 1.1% in 2019 from the prior 1.8% and 1.3% for France compared to the previous 1.6%, while Italy’s outlook was slashed a full percentage point to just 0.2%. 
The Italian revision is particularly sensitive because of the dispute between the populist government in Rome and the Commission over this year's budget deficit. The Commission only agreed to hold off from a disciplinary process because of a revised budget that was based on a much higher growth forecast.
Private forecasts had been on the decline given the recent deterioration in economic data from the Germany and France, the region's largest economies. Economists surveyed by FocusEconomics cut their 2019 growth forecast for the region to 1.5% at the end of January, from 1.6% previously.
“Sluggish global trade and downbeat sentiment will weigh on the Eurozone’s momentum, although a tightening labor market, accommodative monetary policy and low inflation will provide some relief,” the report said, while highlighting downside risks from external factors.
“Rising global protectionism, a sharper slowdown in the global economy and financial-market volatility are all risks.”
Peter Vanden Houte, ING chief economist for Belgium and the euro zone, warned that “peak growth is now behind us.”
He forecast growth of just 1.4% for the euro area this year and also insisted that risks are skewed to the downside.
“In these circumstances, we see little incentive for the ECB to tighten monetary policy. We still think there could be a small hike in the deposit rate, say 15 to 20 basis points, in the fourth quarter of 2019 to start shelving the second deflation-fighting policy instrument, but this is far from a given,” he said."""

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 164.8 points last month against 161.8 in December.
Despite the rise, the index was still 2.2 percent below its January 2018 level.
The FAO dairy price index jumped 7.2 percent from December's value, ending seven months of declines. FAO said limited export supplies from Europe, caused by strong internal demand, was the main driving force behind the increase.
FAO's vegetable oil price index rose 4.3 percent from the previous month, while its sugar index rose 1.3 percent and its cereal index made marginal gains on December. The meat price index was largely unchanged.
FAO lifted its latest world cereal production forecast for 2018 to 2.611 billion tonnes, slightly higher than the December reading, reflecting upward revisions for maize, wheat and rice.
""Much of the projected growth is associated with expected increases in Europe, where beneficial weather has so far shored up yield prospects while also sowings are forecast to expand, largely driven by attractive prices,"" FAO said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell for the first time in six months in November as cheaper oil and higher domestic petroleum production helped to curb the country's import bill, leading economists to boost their economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department's report on Wednesday also showed a drop in imports of consumer goods such as cellphones and other household goods. The decrease in imports followed five straight monthly increases, likely as businesses stocked up amid an escalating trade war between the United States and China. 
""It is possible that some of the consumer goods imports were brought into the country in greater numbers to build a stockpile before the import tariffs took effect or grew even worse,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The good news is this will temporarily boost real GDP in the fourth quarter."" 
The trade deficit dropped 11.5 percent to $49.3 billion in November. It had increased for five straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it would fall to $54.0 billion in November. 
The release of the report was delayed by a recently ended five-week partial shutdown of the federal government.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China fell to $37.9 billion in November from $43.1 billion in October.
The overall trade deficit has remained elevated despite the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies, which have led Washington to impose tariffs on a range of imported goods from China, sparking a trade war with Beijing. 
President Donald Trump has long railed against China's trade surplus with the United States, and accuses Beijing of not playing fairly on trade. The United States has also slapped duties on imported steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after disappointing forecasts from videogame makers. U.S. Treasury yields mostly fell. 
BOOST TO GROWTH
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $7.5 billion to $80.8 billion in November. 
The drop in the so-called real trade deficit led some economists to raise their fourth-quarter GDP growth forecasts by as much as six-tenths of a percentage point to as high as a 3.0 percent annualized rate.
""We had thought that trade would subtract more than half a point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter, but now it looks like trade will be close to neutral for fourth-quarter growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The release of the fourth-quarter GDP report has been delayed by the government shutdown, which ended on Jan. 25 after Trump and Congress agreed to temporarily fund the government without money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall.
Trade subtracted 1.99 percentage points from GDP growth in the July-September quarter. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
In November, imports of goods and services tumbled 2.9 percent to $259.2 billion. Imports of petroleum products fell $1.4 billion, with crude oil imports dropping $0.7 billion. Cheaper oil prices weighed on the petroleum import bill. 
The crude oil price averaged $57.54 per barrel in November, the lowest since April. A domestic energy boom has enabled the United States to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, leading to a reduction in the volume of crude imports.
Consumer goods imports decreased $4.3 billion, pulled down by a $2.3 billion drop in imports of cellphones and other household goods. Some economists said the drop in cellphone imports was puzzling as they were not on the list of goods impacted by tariffs on Chinese imports. 
""The reason for the decline is less clearly attributable to an effect of tariffs and could be more idiosyncratic,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
Exports of goods and services fell 0.6 percent to $209.9 billion. Exports of consumer goods decreased $0.9 billion and those of petroleum products fell $0.6 billion. There were also declines in exports of soybeans, which have been targeted by China in the trade dispute.
Exports of capital goods, however, increased $1.4 billion, lifted by a $1.0 billion rise in civilian aircraft shipments.
Given the dollar's strength and hopeful signs in the U.S.-China trade talks, economists expected the drop in imports to be temporary. The weakness in exports was, however, expected to persist against the backdrop of slowing global economic growth.
Last week, Trump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a trade deal.

""The 2018 trade detente between Trump and Xi has carried into the new year as weaker momentum in China has made Chinese policymakers more conciliatory,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The gap fell 11.5 percent to $49.3 billion, according to a Commerce Department report Wednesday that had been delayed a month by the government shutdown. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a deficit of $54 billion. Imports of all goods and services dropped 2.9 percent, while exports declined 0.6 percent.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage activity decreased 2.5 percent to 378.9 in the week ended Feb. 1. 
Three weeks earlier, it reached an 11-month high at 411.8, raising hopes of a revival in the housing market that decelerated when mortgage rates rose to their highest in about 8-1/2 years in late 2018. 
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with loan balances of $484,350 or less averaged 4.69 percent, which was the lowest since mid-April. A week earlier, they averaged 4.76 percent.
Other mortgage rates MBA tracks were 5 basis points to 10 basis points lower than a week ago.
The week's decline in loan applications was driven by a further pullback in requests to buy a home.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on purchase loan applications, which is seen as a proxy on future housing activity, was 4.9 percent lower at 253.10 last week.
“Despite more favorable borrowing costs...(purchase applications) are now almost 2 percent lower than a year ago,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of industry surveys and forecasts said in a statement. 
""However, moderating price gains and the strong job market, including evidence of faster wage growth, should help purchase growth going forward,” Kan said.
MBA's seasonally-adjusted barometer on mortgage refinancing edged up 0.3 percent at 1,053.4.

The refinance share of total mortgage applications fell to 41.6 percent from 42.0 percent the previous week.

The fourth-quarter gauge of nonfarm business productivity and unit labor cost figures were delayed because they rely on gross domestic product data from the Commerce Department, which was closed and hasn’t released GDP for the period.
Wednesday’s report did include a revision for third-quarter productivity, which rose at a 2.2 percent annualized pace in the period compared with a previously reported 2.3 percent.
While Labor remained open during the shutdown, some of its reports incorporate data from other agencies. That means the nonfarm productivity measure most economists watch can’t be updated, and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis has yet to announce a new date for the GDP report.
The productivity report did include manufacturing efficiency figures, which are derived from other data from Labor and the Federal Reserve. That measure rose 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter after an upwardly revised 1.1 percent in the prior three months, according to the report.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Weaker demand from abroad unexpectedly dragged down German industrial orders in December, data showed on Wednesday, in the latest sign that exporters in Europe's largest economy are being hurt by a slowing world economy and rising trade barriers.
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods were down by 1.6 percent - compared with a 0.3 percent rise forecast by economists - after an upwardly revised drop of 0.2 percent in the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said.
""The decline in orders in December indicates that the industry's phase of weakness is continuing for the time being,"" the Economy Ministry said.
The overall drop was driven by a 5.5 percent plunge in orders from clients outside the euro zone while domestic orders edged down by 0.6 percent.
In a further sign of weakness, industry association VDMA said on Wednesday that engineering orders in December fell by 8 percent in real terms from the previous year.
""It's clear now that the best times for German industry are over,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said.
""In view of the slowing global economy and many political risks, it is doubtful where new and sustainable growth impulses should come from in the near future,"" Krueger added.
Without the distorting effect of bulk orders, new business rose by 3.5 percent on the month, the data showed.
In the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial orders were up 0.3 percent on the quarter, the ministry said. It pointed to a rebound in orders in the automobile sector which had struggled to adjust to new emissions regulation in the third quarter.
SLOW AND SLUGGISH
Still, growth is expected to remain weak at the beginning of the year as sentiment indicators point to a subdued industrial activity in the coming months.
""Industrial orders took another nosedive, indicating that any rebound in industrial activity will be slow and sluggish,"" said Carsten Brzeski from ING.
The Ifo indicator showed last week that German business morale fell for the fifth consecutive month in January, suggesting a downturn.
Other data released last week showed German retail sales fell by the fastest rate in 11 years in December on the month, sending a worrying signal about household spending which has become a key growth driver in Germany.
Record-high employment, rising real wages and low borrowing costs are supporting a domestically driven upswing in Germany, which is facing increasing headwinds from the slowing world economy, tariff disputes and Britain's departure from the EU.
Global trade tensions and concern about Brexit have also prompted the government to slash its growth forecast for this year to 1 percent from 1.8 percent previously as a decade-long boom in Europe's economic powerhouse is losing steam.
The slowing economy also means tax revenues will probably come in below previous estimates. The Finance Ministry said this week that the federal government is facing a budget shortfall of around 25 billion euros ($28.5 billion) by 2023.
This means the government's options for supporting the economy with additional fiscal measures may be limited as Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition has agreed to reject both tax hikes and taking on new debt.
In a marked shift in industrial strategy, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier presented a policy paper on Tuesday that included options for the government to buy stakes in key domestic companies to prevent foreign takeovers, protect key industries and safeguard the country's prosperity.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Weak demand for U.S. consumer loans fuels spending outlook worries,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A sharp drop in demand for U.S. auto and credit card loans could point to a troubling answer to a question vexing economists in recent weeks: Are consumers poised to pull back despite surging job growth?
A partial shutdown of America's federal government in December and January interrupted the flow of official data on U.S. retail spending data that economists and policymakers use to gauge the gusto of U.S. consumers, whose spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic output.
Other economic indicators have pointed to sharp drops in consumer sentiment in December and January as concerns about the global economy rocked financial markets. It remains to be seen is whether sagging confidence is affecting overall consumer spending.
Now, though, a Federal Reserve survey of banks released on Monday shows that the net share of banks reporting weakening demand for auto and credit card rose sharply in late 2018. 
A net 18.2 percent of banks surveyed by the Federal Reserve reported weaker demand for auto loans and 17.4 percent on net reported lower demand for credit card debt. Both were the largest shares in records that go back to 2011.
""This provides evidence for the view that confidence will hurt spending,"" said Lewis Alexander, an economist at Nomura. 
GRAPHIC: Weaker loan demand - https://tmsnrt.rs/2t88EkV 
The drop in auto loan demand corresponds to sales in U.S. light vehicles dropping around 10 percent year-over-year at some point this year, said Michael Pearce, an economist at Capital Economics. 
The Commerce Department has not yet said when it will publish data on retail spending during December originally scheduled for release on Jan. 16. But data from Motor Intelligence Research showed sales of new U.S. light vehicles slumped in January to a 16-month low. 
At the same time, Alexander and other economists point out that the fundamentals for household spending power remain strong, a factor that should mitigate concerns over any consumer pull back.
U.S. job growth surged in January as employers hired 304,000 workers, the most in 11 months. Wage gains have also been accelerating in recent years and gasoline prices tumbled in November and December.
""Some of (this) could just be less need for credit card debt,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics. 
The Fed said that its most recent survey of senior loan officers generally corresponds to activity in the fourth quarter. The S&P 500 stock index plunged 14 percent in the fourth quarter as investors worried about a slowdown in the global economy and a U.S.-China trade war.
That may have played a role in the decline in consumer sentiment and perhaps borrowing as well. The S&P 500 has risen 9 percent this year, so the recent weakness in confidence and loan demand could prove temporary, said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's Analytics. 
""It could have been a knee jerk reaction in consumers to buckle down their borrowing,"" said Sweet.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales are expected to rise between 3.8 percent and 4.4 percent to more than $3.8 trillion in 2019, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said on Tuesday, citing high consumer confidence, low unemployment and rising wages.
Preliminary estimates show retail sales grew 4.6 percent in 2018 to $3.68 trillion, exceeding the retail industry group's forecast for growth of at least 4.5 percent, the NRF said.
The 2018 results are based on Commerce Department data up through November but include NRF estimates for December, as the agency was closed during the recent government shutdown and has not yet released December figures, the NRF said. 
""More people are working, they're making more money, their taxes are lower and their confidence remains high,"" NRF President and Chief Executive Matthew Shay said in a statement.
In 2018, a healthy economy and rising wages gave consumers the confidence to shop and splash out on retailers' annual bargains during the holiday season.
""The biggest priority is to ensure that our economy continues to grow and to avoid self-inflicted wounds. It's time for artificial problems like trade wars and shutdowns to end, and to focus on prosperity not politics,"" Shay added.
The Trump Administration's tariff war with China has forced many retailers to stockpile inventory from China to avoid higher tariffs that may kick in this year.
NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said on Tuesday retailers so far have been able to reduce the impact but that retailers and consumers would likely have to pay higher prices for certain purchases if tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese products rise from 10 percent to 25 percent on March 1.
The trade body also said online and other non-store sales, which are included in the overall number, were expected to increase between 10 percent and 12 percent. 
The retail sales numbers exclude automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants, the NRF said.
It expects the overall economy to gain an average of 170,000 jobs per month in 2019, down from 220,000 in 2018, and that unemployment – currently at 4 percent – will drop to 3.5 percent by the end of the year.
Boosted by rising wages, robust job growth and lower gas prices, consumer research firm Customer Growth Partners (CGP) said on Monday retail sales in 2019 will total $3.77 trillion, up 5 percent from $3.59 trillion in 2018, the fastest growth pace since 2006.

""Unlike the debt-fueled bubble economy of the mid-2000s, today's retail growth is based on strong fundamentals, suggesting that consumers - almost 70 percent of the economy -will continue healthy spending on a healthy pace at least through 2019,"" CGP President Craig Johnson said in a statement.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 12:08PM ET</span>",U.S. services sector activity at six-month low; shutdown blamed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed to a six-month low in January as businesses worried about the impact of a partial shutdown of the federal government on the economy.
Despite showing a second straight monthly moderation in activity, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on Tuesday continued to suggest solid economic growth. The five-week government shutdown ended on Jan. 25 after President Donald Trump and Congress agreed to temporarily fund the government, without money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall.
""This was clearly a disappointing non-manufacturing reading, aggravated by a number of factors, one of which was temporary,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""We anticipate a retracement of this setback in February, but that temporary factor may return to the fore.""
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index dropped 1.3 points to a reading of 56.7 last month. That was the lowest reading since July and marked two straight monthly declines.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The ISM's new orders sub-index for the services sector tumbled 5.0 points to a reading of 57.7 last month, the lowest since December 2017. Its business activity or production gauge also fell sharply. There was also a steep decline in the survey's measure of export orders. 
The survey's services employment measure rose to 57.8 from a reading of 56.6 in December.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as traders awaited Trump's State of the Union address due at 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT on Wednesday). The dollar was up against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
SHUTDOWN HURTS SENTIMENT
According to the ISM, respondents were ""concerned about the impacts of the government shutdown but remain mostly optimistic about overall business conditions."" Some businesses complained about higher prices because of import tariffs and others said they were struggling with capacity constraints.
Eleven services industries, including transportation and warehousing, healthcare and social assistance, finance and insurance, utilities, and public administration, reported growth in January. That was down from 16 in December and the fewest since August 2016.
Seven non-manufacturing industries including retail trade, educational services and information reported contraction in January. The ebb in sentiment was also mirrored by another survey from data firm Markit, which showed its services sector PMI falling to a four-month low of 54.2 in January from a reading of 54.4 in December.

""We think that concerns about the government shutdown may have been depressing sentiment,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. "" Now that the shutdown is over, we think that sentiment could bounce back at least somewhat, but this is not guaranteed.""

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 56.7 from 58.0 in December, which was revised up from an initial reading of 57.6.
“The non-manufacturing sector’s growth rate cooled off in January. Respondents are concerned about the impacts of the government shutdown but remain mostly optimistic about overall business conditions,” said Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM survey committee.
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector released on Friday showed that U.S. factory activity was higher than expected.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector, and a reading below signals contraction.
Among the sub-indices, the non-manufacturing business activity index decreased to 59.7 last month, from 61.2 in December.
The new orders index, the most forward-looking element of the survey, fell to 57.7 from 62.7 the previous month, the lowest level since August 2018.
Export orders fell to 50.5 from 59.5, the worst reading in two years, suggesting a slowdown abroad.
The employment index rose to 57.8 from 56.6 previously, while the prices index jumped to 59.4 from 58.0 in December."

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone businesses expanded at their weakest rate since mid-2013 at the start of the year as demand fell for the first time in four years, with a manufacturing slowdown spreading to services, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Forward-looking indicators in the downbeat survey also suggested there will not be any turnaround soon. That will make disappointing reading for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who recently ended their more than 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase stimulus program.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, dipped to 51.0 from December's 51.1, its lowest reading since July 2013.
While that was higher than an earlier flash reading of 50.7, it was barely above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""It does suggest the euro zone economy has been weakening for a while now and the anticipated rebound in activity is not really happening,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""On the whole, we are operating in very low gear and it suggests the ECB is not going to be in any position to tighten policy for some time to come.""
Retail sales in the euro zone fell as expected in December, dragged down by the steepest decline in shopping in Germany in 11 years, official data showed on Tuesday. That reinforced the sense of an economy slowing at the close of the year.
Individual PMI surveys showed while German activity accelerated, it looked tenuous. France's composite reading sank to 48.2, its lowest in over four years.
BRITAIN FLAT-LINES
Across the channel, another PMI showed Britain's giant services industry is suffering and risks stalling or contracting as Brexit nears and the global economy slows.
Services firms reported job cuts for the first time in six years amid falling orders, according to the survey which suggested Britain's economy is flat-lining after losing momentum late last year. 
Markets shrugged off the euro zone data but sterling dipped to a two-week low following the British PMI release.
The PMI for the euro zone's services industry held steady at December's 51.2, which was its lowest reading since November 2014. Growth in factory activity was minimal in January, a sister survey showed on Friday. 
IHS Markit said the composite PMI pointed to first-quarter economic growth of just 0.1 percent across the 19 countries that use the euro, much slower than the 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month. 
Worryingly, some of that scant growth came from firms running down backlogs for a second month as demand fell. An overall new business index sank to 49.5 from 50.7, its first sub-50 reading since November 2014.
In further signs of a slowdown, services firms increased headcount at the slowest rate since late 2016. The employment index dropped to 52.3 from 53.6 in December.
""All in all, it is likely this is not a one-off. It's part of a trend that has been in place for some time and it's kind of difficult to see how we turn around from here,"" said Dixon.

A closely watched gauge of the world's fifth-biggest economy, the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index, fell to 50.1 in January from 51.2 in December -- its lowest level since July 2016 and barely above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
A Reuters poll of economists had expected a reading of 51.0.
Britain's economy defied forecasts from some economists that it would go into recession after the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union. But growth slowed sharply in late 2018 as worries mounted about an abrupt, no-deal Brexit.
Overall, the survey suggested Britain's economy is flat-lining after losing momentum late last year.
Tuesday's figures are likely to worry Bank of England officials ahead of their latest interest rate decision announcement and new forecasts for the economy on Thursday.
""The latest PMI survey results indicate that the UK economy is at risk of stalling or worse as escalating Brexit uncertainty coincides with a wider slowdown in the global economy,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
The report adds to other signs that Brexit, scheduled in less than two months' time, is taking its toll on businesses and consumers.
Prime Minister Theresa May, under pressure from her own Conservative Party, wants to reopen her withdrawal agreement with the European Union to replace a contested Irish border arrangement, something Brussels has rejected.
Investors are urging the government to ensure an orderly exit from the club Britain joined in 1973.
On Monday, a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers showed appetite to take on financial risk had fallen to its lowest level in nearly a decade due to fears of ""the hardest of Brexits"" and rising U.S. protectionism.
That caution was evident in Tuesday's survey, covering the bulk of Britain's private sector economy.
New orders fell for only the second time since the financial crisis, while employers cut jobs for the first time since late 2012 -- around the last time Britain flirted with recession.
""The survey results indicate that companies are becoming increasingly risk-averse and eager to reduce overheads in the face of weakened customer demand and rising political uncertainty,"" Williamson said.
New export orders contracted at the fastest pace since records for this part of the PMI began in September 2014.
The composite PMI for December, combining the manufacturing, construction and service sectors, fell to 50.3 from 51.5 in November, the lowest level since July 2016.

The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said on Tuesday that retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro were down 1.6 percent month-on-month in December, in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Year-on-year, retail trade rose by 0.8 percent.
The monthly decline, which wiped out the 0.8 percent gains of October and November, reinforces the sense of an economy slowing at the close of the year. 
Eurostat reported last week that the euro zone economy rose by just 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of 2018, matching the four year low of the third quarter.
Economic sentiment in the zone also fell to a two-year low in January, with the steepest decline among retail managers.
In Tuesday's data, non-food sales fell by 2.7 percent from November, with declines of 2.1 percent for electrical goods and furniture, 2.9 percent for textiles and clothing and 6.1 percent for mail order and internet sales.
The steepest fall by far was in Germany, where retail sales declined by 4.3 percent month-on-month. Germany's statistics office has said the drop was compared to a very strong November, boosted by pre-Christmas shopping and discount days such as Black Friday. 
In France, the euro zone's second biggest economy, retail sales fell by just 0.1 percent. In Austria, Ireland and Portugal, retail sales rose.

The report follows weaker-than-expected surveys for the manufacturing and construction sector, all of which were affected by the same Brexit-related worries.
Construction activity hit a 10-month low with builders unwilling to begin new projects, while manufacturers were stockpiling at the fastest rate in years to ensure they can keep producing if the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29 without transitional arrangements to safeguard their supply chains.
Research firm IHS Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index fell to 50.1 in January, below forecasts for a reading of 51.1, and below December’s reading of 51.2.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
“The latest PMI survey results indicate that the UK economy is at risk of stalling or worse as escalating Brexit uncertainty coincides with a wider, slower slowdown in the global economy,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
“The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years, and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter,” he warned."

Business activity among Italian services providers shrank in January and forced companies to reduce headcount for the first time in more than two years, a Purchasing Managers’ Index showed on Tuesday. Firms cited weakening domestic demand and a decline in export orders as reasons for the job cuts.
While the Italian economy, which slipped into recession at the end of 2018, marks a particularly weak spot in the region, cracks have appeared across the 19-nation bloc.
Germany’s industry has been deeply scarred by carmakers’ struggles with new emissions tests and waning global trade. In France, consumer spending took a hit from violent protests against the government.
Activity in French services has declined rapidly in the past two months, with the January PMI indicating the worst contraction in almost five years. New business fell for a second month and job creation slowed.
For the euro area as a whole, the composite reading of manufacturing and services was revised up to 51 compared with an initial estimate of 50.7. But the survey still signals “only weak growth in business activity,” IHS said.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.6 in January from 51.0 in December.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 28th month.
""Business activity grew at a stronger rate, supported by stronger demand and continued growth of employment,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The improvement in the services sector is likely to be overshadowed by a survey last week showing manufacturing activity skidded to a 29-month low as exports tumbled due to the trade war.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 50.9 in January from 52.0 in December because of the deterioration in the manufacturing sector.
Another risk to Japan's domestic demand is the government's plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October.
The government will offer temporary tax breaks and subsidies to soften the blow to consumption, but some economists are worried that households will still curb spending after taxes rise.
Japan's household sentiment is sensitive to changes in the global economic outlook, because many manufacturers export machinery and electronic parts to companies in China.

This means consumer spending could also weaken if the trade war between the United States and China drags on without resolution.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said its members reported total sales increased by an annual 2.2 percent, helped by higher spending on food and New Year price cutting.
""While retail discounts helped tempt cautious consumers, there is no guarantee this momentum will continue after the sales have finished,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said.
""Furthermore, the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit could see these fortunes reversed.""
Prime Minister Theresa May wants European Union leaders to offer more concessions on Britain's exit deal, less than two months to go before the country is due to leave the bloc.
The BRC said colder weather helped drive clothing sales.
British consumers have seen their spending power squeezed for much of the past 10 years although their wages have grown more quickly than inflation in recent months.
Reflecting the squeeze, sales of non-essentials fell again in the three months to January, the BRC said. 
Separately on Tuesday, Barclaycard said its measure of consumer spending rose by 2.9 percent in annual terms, also quicker than December's 1.8 percent rise.
Similar to the BRC, Barclaycard said the increase was driven mostly by spending on essentials which rose the most in five months, up 6.4 percent. Supermarket spending was up by 6.8 percent, the most since April 2017. 
Supermarket groups Sainsbury's and Morrisons both missed their Christmas sales forecasts. Sainsbury's highlighted highly competitive and markets which were awash with discounts.

In a foreboding assessment, banks said they expected in 2019 ""to tighten standards for all categories of business loans as well as credit card loans and jumbo mortgages,"" according to the quarterly report from the Fed.
Credit is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy and reports of weaker demand - coupled with expectations at banks that standards will tighten - suggests U.S. lenders are seeing signs that economic growth could slow.
Fed policymakers last month indicated they were pausing a rate increase campaign that began in December 2015 as the U.S. central bank tries to sort out how much a weakening global economy could drag on the United States.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, U.S. ""banks reported weaker demand for all categories of loans to households,"" the Fed said, an assessment that suggested U.S. consumers could also be worried about the economic outlook.

Factory goods orders fell 0.6 percent, the Commerce Department said, after an unrevised 2.1 percent drop in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.2 percent in November. The release of the report was delayed by a recently ended five-week partial shutdown of the federal government.
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management published last Friday suggested manufacturing activity picked up at the start of the year, driven by a sharp rebound in orders in January. But some manufacturers continued to complain that tariffs on steel imports were pushing up prices of raw materials.
In November orders for machinery tumbled 1.7 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in October. There were large declines in orders for industrial and metalworking machinery, as well as ventilation, heating, air‐conditioning and refrigeration equipment.
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components dropped 1.1 percent after rising 1.0 percent in October. But orders for transportation equipment rebounded 3.0 percent after plunging 12.4 percent in October. 
Orders for civilian aircraft and parts rose 6.9 percent in November. Motor vehicles and parts orders edged up 0.1 percent.
The Commerce Department also said November orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, dropped 0.6 percent as reported in December. Orders for these so-called core capital goods increased 0.5 percent in October.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, slipped 0.2 percent in November instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip.

Core capital goods shipments jumped 0.8 percent in October.

Russian gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.3 percent in 2018 year-on-year after having grown 1.6 percent a year earlier, according to the data.
The economy ministry last month increased its GDP growth estimate in 2018 to 2 percent from 1.8 percent, citing a significant increase in construction activity.
In January Rosstat revised construction sector growth for the first 11 months of 2018 to 5.7 percent, sharply up from the previously reported 0.5 percent in annual terms.
The Economy Ministry, which also oversees Rosstat, said back then that the statistics service has revised the construction growth in Russia's northern Yamalo-Nenets region. 
The ministry did not say which construction sites affected the statistics, though Novatek, Russia's biggest private gas producer, runs its Yamal LNG plant in the region.The plant reached full production capacity in 2018.

Eurostat said prices at factory gates in he 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.8 percent in December against November and were 3.0 percent higher than in December 2017.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.6 percent monthly fall and a 3.2 percent annual rise.
The sharper than expected monthly fall was mainly due to a monthly drop in energy prices, which fell 2.6 percent in December and rose 7.7 percent higher year-on-year. 
Without the volatile energy costs, producer prices fell only 0.1 percent on the month and 1.3 percent higher year-on-year.
Producer prices are an early indication of consumer inflation trends because changes in prices at factory gates impact final prices in shops. 

The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer prices below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term.

Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro zone dropped to -3.7 in February from -1.5, falling for a sixth consecutive month to hit its lowest level since November 2014. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of -0.6.
A sub-index on the current situation also weakened for a sixth month running, slumping to its weakest level since December 2016.
""The main reason for this development is increasingly likely to be Brexit, which is getting closer,"" Sentix managing director Manfred Huebner said in a statement. ""Given the unclear political situation, businesses now have to grapple with contingency plans.""
He also said that investors sensed that there was potential for central banks - especially the U.S. Federal Reserve - to take certain steps to loosen monetary policy.
Last week, the Fed discarded a promise to keep raising rates, and instead pledged patience on further policy change. The dovish shift was cheered by financial markets, but sounded to some analysts like a warning of economic weakness ahead.
A separate index on investor morale in Germany fell in February to 3.1 from 6.1, the fourth consecutive decline, hitting the lowest level since August 2012.
""The German economy, which has been the economic locomotive of the euro zone in recent years, is losing more steam,"" Huebner said, adding that the German export model was coming under pressure both from Brexit and problems the car industry is facing in China.
China car sales fell 13 percent in December, the sixth straight month of declines, bringing annual sales to 28.1 million, down 2.8 percent from a year earlier, China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said in January.

The report follows a similar one for the manufacturing sector on Friday that also fell short of expectations, and noted that companies were stockpiling at the fastest rate in years to ensure they can keep producing if the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29 without any transitional trading arrangements in place.
Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index fell to 50.6 in January, compared to forecasts for a reading of 52.6.
The December reading was 52.8.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The research firm highlighted that January data pointed to a loss of momentum for the UK construction sector, with business activity growth easing to its weakest for ten months.
“A number of survey respondents noted that Brexit uncertainty had led to hesitancy among clients and a corresponding slowdown in progress on new projects,” IHS Markit said.
Tim Moore, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, noted that that “staff recruitment slowed to a crawl in January” with the softest rate of job creation since July 2016.
“Delays to client decision-making on new projects in response to Brexit uncertainty was cited as a key source of anxiety at the start of 2019,” Moore explained.
Over the weekend, Japanese automaker Nissan cancelled a decision to build its new X-Trail SUV at its plant in Sunderland in north-eastern England, citing uncertainty over Brexit as one of its considerations.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.6 from 52.8 in December, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 52.4.
Growth in the housebuilding and civil engineering sectors slowed sharply and activity contracted in the commercial sector for the first time since March, when construction was hit by unusually cold temperatures.
Construction firms hired staff at the slowest pace since July 2016, just after the Brexit referendum, as optimism soured ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union, scheduled in less than two months' time.
""Delays to client decision-making on new projects in response to Brexit uncertainty was cited as a key source of anxiety at the start of 2019,"" Tim Moore, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit, said.
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector also showed a sharp slowdown underway, caused by a cooling global economy as well as Brexit uncertainty.
Prime Minister Theresa May, under pressure from her own Conservative Party, wants to reopen a Brexit treaty with the European Union to replace a contested Irish border arrangement, something Brussels has rejected.
Investors have urged the government to ensure an orderly exit from the club it joined in 1973.

226,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 09:00PM ET</span>",Australia Building Permits See Worst Two-Month Drop Since 2009,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian building approvals suffered the biggest annual back-to-back drop in almost a decade as a housing slump deepens.
Building permits fell 22.5 percent in December from a year earlier after plunging 33.5 percent in November, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed in Sydney Monday. That’s the worst two-month result since January-February 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis.
A separate private report from Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. showed job advertisements slid 3.7 percent in January from a year earlier, the first annual decline since April 2015.
The fall is significant because a healthy labor market is a key reason why the Reserve Bank is likely to stare down market pricing for an interest-rate cut. Policy makers see low unemployment as ensuring households can meet their financial commitments and as a signal of underlying strength in the economy.
The Australian dollar fell after the reports, buying 72.36 U.S. cents at 12:25 p.m. in Sydney from 72.52 before their release.
The RBA has kept rates on hold at a record-low 1.5 percent since August 2016 and maintains the economy is weathering a reversal in property prices. Sydney’s housing market is down 12.3 percent from peak-to-trough -- having soared in the five years through mid-2017 in response to policy easing. The central bank expects low rates to keep tightening the labor market and eventually drive faster wage growth and higher inflation.
The RBA holds its first policy meeting of the year Tuesday; Governor Philip Lowe delivers a speech Wednesday; and the central bank releases its quarterly update of forecasts for economic growth, inflation and unemployment Friday.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 12:27AM ET</span>",China's services sector moderates in January but still solid: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's sprawling services sector maintained a solid pace of expansion in January even though growth moderated slightly, a private survey showed on Sunday, offering continued support for the world's second-largest economy as manufacturing cools. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell slightly to 53.6 in January from 53.9 in December, but well above the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction. 
Overseas sales continued to support the sector, with new export business rising at the fastest clip in more than a year, thanks to efforts among Chinese services firms to attract foreign clients. Overall new orders also ticked higher, to 52.6 from 52.3 in December.
The resilience of the services sector, which accounts for more than half of China's gross domestic product, is key to countering the ongoing slowdown in manufacturing. 
Chinese factories have been hit by a long-term restructuring of industries, a crackdown on pollution and China's trade tensions with the United States.
""Overall, China's economic growth was weighed on by weakening domestic demand in January, although exports improved marginally as the Sino-U.S. trade negotiations flagged signs of progress,"" said Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
China's policies to support domestic demand and developments in the trade war ""will remain key to the prospects of the Chinese economy. Given that the government has refrained from taking policies of strong stimulus, the downward trend of the economy may be hard to turn around for the time being,"" Zhong said.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Sunday, slipped to 50.9 in January from 52.2 in December. The January manufacturing PMI, announced on Friday, was 48.3, the lowest since February 2016. 
Beijing has taken a raft of measures in the past year to encourage growth - reducing the levels of cash that banks must hold as reserves to spur lending, cutting taxes and fees, and expediting infrastructure spending. 
Resolving trade tensions with the United States remains key to improving sentiment and lifting the outlook for Chinese exporters.
Illustrating how China's services sector is holding up, services firms added to their payroll numbers in January. Inflation pressures eased, with operating costs and output charges rising at a slower pace. 
Caixin's upbeat readings for services were consistent with a official survey published on Thursday that showed the industry picked up for a second straight month in January.

A slight boost in sentiment after the shutdown ended is unlikely to last, as the resolution is only until mid-February.
The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index was revised up to 91.2 from a preliminary reading of 90.7. Economists had forecast a reading of 90.8.
""Consumer sentiment remained at month-end at its lowest level since (U.S. President Donald) Trump was elected. The end of the shutdown caused only a modest boost in the Sentiment Index. The typical impact of such ""crisis"" events is short lived, with consumers quickly regaining lost confidence,"" Surveys of Consumers Chief Economist Richard Curtin said.
A sub-index tracking consumer expectations rose to 79.9 from 78.3, while a separate gauge tracking current conditions fell to 108.8 from 110.0.
Consumers are not as optimistic about future job gains due to the shutdown, the survey found.
""There is still time to avoid a sustained decline in confidence, but it would require an end to the standoff. Indeed, if the current level of confidence is maintained, it would be consistent with a 2.6% growth in consumer spending in 2019,"" Curtin said."
229,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 10:01AM ET</span>",ISM Manufacturing Survey Shows Surprising Strength in January,"Investing.com - The rate of growth in the U.S.'s manufacturing sector surprisingly picked up in January, according to a report released on Friday.
The Institute of Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 56.6 in January, from 54.3 the previous month, defying expectations for a drop to 54.2. 
That's a sharp contrast to analogous surveys from the rest of the world published on Friday, which showed manufacturing activity contracting in China and Germany, and slowing sharply in Italy and the U.K. 
However, it's consistent with strong data from the labor market this week, with both the ADP and government figures for job creation coming in well above expectations.
The more forward-looking new orders index rose to 58.2 in January from 51.3 a month earlier.
The employment index decreased to 55.5 from 56.0, while the prices paid index decreased to 49.6, from a previous reading of 54.9.
The prices paid index hadn't fallen below 50 since the first quarter of 2016, and the drop was much sharper than expected. Analysts had forecast it to fall to just 54.5.
An index reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 signals contraction.
“The manufacturing sector continues to expand, reversing December’s weak expansion, but inputs and prices indicate fundamental changes in supply chain constraints,” Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM business survey committee, said in the report."
230,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 09:47AM ET</span>",U.S. job growth jumps; unemployment rate rises to 4.0 percent,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in January, with employers hiring the most workers in 11 months, pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite a darkening outlook that has left the Federal Reserve wary about more interest rate hikes this year.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed no ""discernible"" impact on job growth from a 35-day partial government shutdown. But the longest shutdown in history, which ended a week ago, pushed up the unemployment rate to a seven-month high of 4.0 percent. 
The report came two days after the Fed signaled its three-year interest rate hike campaign might be ending because of rising headwinds to the economy, including financial market volatility and slowing global growth. 
""The Fed chickened out on further rate hikes this year and boy are they ever misreading the tea leaves on where the economy is going next,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""U.S. companies have not let up one bit on their hiring in response to risks out there in the world economy.""
Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018, the Labor Department said. Job growth was boosted by hiring at construction sites, retailers and business services as well as at restaurants, hotels and amusement parks.
But the economy added 70,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in November and December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 165,000 jobs in January. Roughly 100,000 per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
January marked 100 straight months of job gains. 
The government shutdown saw about 380,000 workers furloughed but President Donald Trump signed a law guaranteeing these employees back pay. As a result, these workers were included in the survey of employers from which the payrolls number is calculated. 
The furloughed workers were, however, considered unemployed on ""temporary layoff"" in the separate survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived. This lifted the unemployment rate by one-tenth of a percentage point from 3.9 percent in December. The shutdown ended last Friday after Trump and Congress agreed to temporary government funding, without money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall.
The dollar rose against the euro and the yen after the employment report, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. U.S. stock futures reversed losses.
MONTHLY WAGES GAINS SLOW
Average hourly earnings rose three cents, or 0.1 percent in January after accelerating 0.4 percent in December. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 3.2 percent from 3.3 percent in December. 
With key data from the Commerce Department, including the fourth-quarter gross domestic product report, still delayed because of the government shutdown, the employment report is the clearest evidence yet that the economy remains on solid ground.
The Fed on Wednesday kept interest rates steady but said it would be patient in raising borrowing costs further this year. The U.S. central bank removed language from its December policy statement that risks to the outlook were ""roughly balanced.""
Clouds have been gathering over the economic expansion, now in its ninth year and the second longest on record, with business and consumer confidence deteriorating in recent months. Confidence has been eroded by the fight over the government budget and Washington's trade war with Beijing.
Other headwinds to the economy include the fading boost from a $1.5 trillion tax cut, slowing growth in China and Europe, as well as the risk of a disorderly departure by Britain from the European Union.
With its January employment report, the government published its annual ""benchmark"" revisions and updated the formulas it uses to smooth the data for regular seasonal fluctuations. It also incorporated new population estimates.
The government said the level of employment in March of last year was 1,000 lower on a seasonally adjusted basis than it had reported. The shift in population controls had no impact on the unemployment and labor force participation rates.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, jumped to an 11-month high of 8.1 percent from 7.6 percent in January. It was boosted by the government shutdown.
Job growth increased broadly in January. Employment at construction sites surged 52,000, the most since February 2018, after increasing 28,000 in December. Hiring was likely boosted by mild temperatures in January.
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 13,000, slowing from December's 20,000 increase. Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector jumped by 74,000. Retail payrolls rebounded by 20,800 jobs. Professional and business services employment increased by 30,000 jobs last month.
The government added 8,000 jobs last month. There were increases in healthcare, transportation and warehousing employment, as well as financial activities. But utilities and information payrolls fell in January.

The average workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours in January.

Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 304,000 in January, compared to the consensus estimate for the creation of 165,000 jobs, and the 213,000 new positions that the ADP report indicated on Wednesday.
December’s reading of NFP was revised down from an initial 312,000 reading to a gain of 222,000.
The jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 4.0%. Analysts had expected it to remain unchanged at 3.9%.
Average hourly earnings advanced 0.1% month-on-month in January, below the consensus estimate of 0.3% and a slowdown from December’s increase of 0.4%.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation grew 3.2% in January, in line with expectations. Average hourly earnings had gained 3.3% the previous month in what was an upward revision from an initial 3.2% rise.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Average weekly hours held steady as expected at 34.5 last month.
Government payrolls increased by 8,000 last month, compared to the prior creation of 16,000 public positions.
December’s data on government payrolls was an upward revision from the initial gain of 11,000 public positions.
The participation rate rose to 63.2% last month, from December’s reading of 63.1%.
The U-6 unemployment rate, that includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, increased to 8.1% in January from the prior 7.6%."
232,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 05:54AM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation falls, though core rate inches higher","BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation dipped as expected last month, falling further from the European Central Bank's target and providing yet another reason for the bank to slow down in removing stimulus. 
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro slowed to 1.4 percent from 1.6 percent a month earlier, Eurostat said on Friday, another soft reading for an economy suffering its biggest slowdown since its debt crisis. 
Although a moderation in energy price growth accounted for the bulk of the drop, underlying inflation, a key indicator for the ECB, also remained weak, ticking up only a touch and defying the bank's expectation for a more substantial rise. 
Still, a pick-up in core inflation or prices excluding food and energy to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent may be somewhat comforting for the ECB, as services costs are finally rising, suggesting that higher wages may be feeding through to consumer prices.
But the biggest worry for the ECB may now be the health of the bloc's economy, not monthly inflation readings. 
The euro zone is barely growing this quarter and the ECB has already warned that risks are skewed to the downside, suggesting that more negative news may be in the pipeline. 
Indeed, manufacturing in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, contracted for the first time in more than four years in January, data showed on Friday, and the Bundesbank warned that its growth forecast may need to be slashed.
All the bad news suggests that the ECB's next move could be to provide further stimulus, having ended its unprecedented 2.6 trillion euro ($3 trillion) bond purchase scheme, known as quantitative easing, only weeks ago. 
While the bond purchases are unlikely to be restarted, the ECB is expected to provide banks with more cheap loans to keep credit flowing to the real economy, even during the downturn.
It is also expected to give up guidance that points to steady interest rates through the summer and rate hikes later. 
The ECB targets inflation at just below 2 percent but has undershot this target since early 2013.
Its December forecasts, already seen as too optimistic, suggest that it will continue to miss for years to come; ECB President Mario Draghi recently argued that weakness in economic growth could mean it would take longer to lift price growth back to target.

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said its consumer price index rose 1.4% in January from the same month a year earlier, down from 1.6% in December. The reading was in line with expectations.
Oil prices, which fell sharply in the last quarter of the year, have been largely responsible for the decline in the headline inflation rate. Energy cost inflation was running over at over 10% in October, but slowed to only 2.6% year-on-year in January, Eurostat said.
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to an annual rate of 1.1% from 1.0% in the previous month.
The European Central Bank targets a headline inflation rate of close to, but just below 2%. It warned last week that the downside risks to the economy had increased. Some economists are now forecasting that the ECB will be forced to take fresh measures to stimulate the economy later this year, despite ending its net purchases of bonds at the end of 2018."

LONDON, (Reuters) - British factories scrambled to stockpile goods in January at the fastest rate since records began in the early 1990s as they braced for a potentially chaotic Brexit in less than two months' time, a business survey showed on Friday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) also showed deepening pessimism across the sector which saw output grow by the smallest amount since July 2016.
The survey's overall index fell to 52.8 from 54.2 in December, a three-month low and below the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for 53.5. 
While better than the similar readings of manufacturing in France and Germany, survey compiler IHS Markit said the out-performance of British factories was driven by a surge in demand for stockpiling materials ahead of Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May, under pressure from her own Conservative Party, wants to reopen a Brexit treaty with the European Union to replace a contested Irish border arrangement, something Brussels has rejected.
Investors have urged the government to ensure an orderly exit from the club it joined in 1973.
Almost one-in-three British companies are thinking of shifting operations abroad because of Brexit, a survey from the Institute of Directors industry body showed earlier on Friday. 
And on Thursday, figures showed investment in Britain's car industry halved last year.
IHS Markit said there was a ""clear risk"" that the manufacturing sector -- accounting for 10 percent of British economic output -- will go into recession.
""Despite the temporary boost provided by clients' pre-purchases and efforts to build-up stocks, the underlying trends in output and new orders remained lackluster at best,"" Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said.
Export orders were flat, the PMI showed, reflecting a slowdown in the global economy.
British factories cut jobs slightly as backlogs of work contracted at a faster pace in January and the survey's gauge of optimism hit a 30-month low, again reflecting Brexit worries and weakening growth in continental Europe.
Easing price pressures marked a rare plus point for British manufacturers. Input costs increased at the slowest pace since May 2016, the survey showed.

Research firm Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.8, compared to forecasts for a reading of 53.5. While output rose, it was offset by weak expansion in the intermediate goods sectors and a decline in investment goods.

Growth in euro zone factory activity was minimal in January as new orders fell at the fastest rate in nearly six years, suggesting manufacturers are acting as a drag on the economy, a survey showed on Friday.
Some of that scant growth was from factories running down backlogs of orders for a fifth month while having to stockpile finished products at the fastest rate since the survey began in June 1997.
The slowdown comes just weeks after the European Central Bank shuttered its more than 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase programme and will fuel expectations a global economic slowdown is underway, as highlighted in a Reuters poll last month. [ECILT/WRAP]
IHS Markit's January final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a sixth month, coming in at 50.5 from December's 51.4, matching a flash reading but barely above the 50 level separating growth from contraction. 
That was its lowest reading since November 2014 and an index measuring output which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday - seen as a good gauge of economic health - fell to a 5-1/2 year low of 50.5 from 51.0.
Protests in France, an auto sector struggling to regain momentum, political uncertainty and rising trade protectionism were all cited by managers as reasons for the slowdown, IHS Markit said.
""The January PMI adds to the likelihood that the manufacturing sector is in recession and will act as a drag on the economy in the first quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Worryingly, weaker than anticipated sales mean warehouses are filling up with unsold stock ... suggesting firms will need to cut operating capacity in coming months unless demand revives, boding ill for future production growth."" 
An index measuring stocks of finished goods jumped to a survey high of 51.5 from 50.7. Other forward looking indicators showed factories reduced purchases of raw materials for a second month and cut back on hiring.

""Any such downturn in the labour market will in turn potentially drive consumer sentiment lower, and adds further to the risk that economic growth will continue to slow in coming months,"" Williamson said.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 12:55AM ET</span>",Macau's casinos post first revenue drop in 29 months,"(Reuters) - Gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau dropped 5 percent in January, the first drop in more than two years, as appetite for gambling waned amid slowing economic growth and increased headwinds from the Sino-U.S. trade war. 
The special administrative region reported 24.9 billion patacas ($3 billion) revenue, compared with 26.3 billion patacas a year ago, Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination said on Friday. 
The drop was likely due to a smoking ban that came into effect on Jan. 1 as well as muted sentiment among VIP players ahead of Chinese New Year holidays in February, analysts said. 
The figure was in line with analyst expectations of flat to a 12 percent drop in growth. The total revenue figure of 24.9 billion patacas dropped month on month from December last year but was the same as November's monthly figure. 
Macau, located on China's southern coast and the country's only legal casino hub, is highly reliant on gambling revenue for its finances, with taxes from the casinos accounting over 80 percent of the government's revenue. 
Authorities have asked operators to diversify from solely gambling and broaden Macau's economic base in order to lessen the territory's dependence on the glitzy casinos.
They have also been pushing the six casino concessionaires - Sands China, Wynn Macau, SJM Holdings, MGM China, Melco Resorts and Galaxy Entertainment - to provide more non-gaming amenities in a bid to diversify.
Licenses of the concessionaires begin to expire next year but there is no clarity yet on what happens after that.
Revenue growth is likely to remain moderate in 2019 as concerns about China's growth weighed on gambling appetite of players in the high-roller VIP segment, analysts said.
Nevertheless, casino executives are bullish on the potential benefits from the opening last year of the world's longest sea-crossing bridge and tunnel, linking Macau to the financial center of Hong Kong and mainland China's Pearl River Delta. 
The bridge connects Hong Kong's international airport to the casino hub in just over half an hour. Prior to the bridge opening, visitors would have to take a one-hour ferry ride from the former British colony to Macau. 
Authorities are also hoping it will boost the development of Macau's convention and exhibition business and lift overnight visitation numbers, which help drive non-gaming revenue.

238,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 12:52AM ET</span>",China Caixin Manufacturing PMI Worsens in January,"Investing.com - China’s Caixin manufacturing PMI contracted more than expected in January, a private survey showed on Friday.
The Caixin/Markit index of manufacturing for January came in at 48.3 from 49.7 last month. The reading was at its lowest since February 2016. Analysts previously expected a reading of 49.5 for January.
""Latest survey data signalled subdued overall operating conditions in the Chinese manufacturing sector at the start of 2019,"" the statement by Caixin and IHS Markit said. ""Softer demand conditions led companies to revise their production schedules ... Underlying data indicated that weakness largely stemmed from muted domestic demand.""
Official PMI numbers that were released on Thursday showed China’s manufacturing sector contracted for the second straight month in January. The January reading came in at 49.5, largely in line with expectations and was slightly higher than the 49.4 in December.
Large businesses and state-owned enterprises make up a large proportion of responses in the official PMI, while the Caixin indicator has a bigger mix of small- and medium-sized firms.
Trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials were concluded on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump said the talks had “tremendous progress,” while Chinese state-owned media Xinhua reported that Beijing agreed to increase imports of ""US agricultural products, energy products, industrial manufactured goods and service products"" during the talks.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 11:43PM ET</span>","Indian jobless rate at multi-decade high, report says, in blow to Modi","By Manoj Kumar and Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An official survey that has been withheld by the government shows India's unemployment rate rose to its highest level in at least 45 years in 2017/18, the Business Standard newspaper reported on Thursday, delivering a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi months before a general election.
A political controversy over the survey erupted after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the jobs data resigned, saying there had been a delay in its scheduled December release and alleging interference by other state agencies.
The assessment by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), conducted July 2017-June 2018, showed an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent. That was the highest since 1972/73, the period for which the data are comparable, the newspaper reported, citing documents it had reviewed. It did not give a figure for 1972/73.
But the government think-tank NITI Aayog said the report was only a draft and that a final version would be published in March. It denied unemployment was widespread in India, whose economy is one of the fastest growing in the world.
""You can't be growing annually at 7.2 percent and saying that there are no jobs being created in the economy,"" NITI Aayog Chief Executive Amitabh Kant said at a press conference.
""To my mind, the problem is that there's a lack of good-quality jobs, and that's what we need to focus on. There's a wages problem, and there's a very big informal sector in India's economy.""
He said the country was creating more than 7 million jobs a year, enough for ""new entrants"" joining the workforce.
Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress party, the main opposition, said the report showed ""a national disaster"".
Though India's economy has been expanding by 7 percent plus annually, uneven growth has meant that new jobs are not keeping pace. And critics say the government's claims of economic success have sounded increasingly hollow.
Modi's ambitious Make-in-India project has failed to take off. It was intended to increase the share of domestic manufacturing from 17 percent of gross domestic product to about 25 percent and create jobs for an estimated 1.2 million youth entering the market each month.
Instead, the report showed 18.7 percent of urban males aged 15-29 were without work, and the jobless rate for urban females the same age was 27.2 percent.
Worse, the labor force participation rate - the proportion of population working or seeking jobs - declined to 36.9 percent in 2017/18 from 39.5 percent in 2011/12, the report said. The comparable rate for the United States was 63.1 percent in December.
The NITI Aayog said the government needed more quarterly data to publish a ""comparable"" jobs report.
But P.C. Mohanan, who on Monday resigned as the head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission, said the standalone report for the last fiscal year should have been published.
""There's no link between this and the quarterly data,"" Mohanan told Reuters. ""This report was released for approval because this is a standalone report and it does not require any additional verification with any sources.""
CRISIS EVERYWHERE
Himanshu, an associate professor at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University who specializes in development economics, said that the jobs crisis was everywhere to see.
""News and data like thousands of PhDs applying for waiter jobs in Mumbai or millions applying for just a thousand jobs in Gujarat or 10 million applying for a small number of jobs in railways,"" he said.
""I mean, these kind of examples are everywhere,"" he said, pointing to street protests by caste and other interest groups seeking quotas for government jobs.
The data provides the first comprehensive assessment of India's employment since Modi's decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country's banknotes from circulation overnight.
After the chaotic launch of a national sales tax in July 2017, hundreds of thousands have lost jobs in small businesses.
The gloomy jobs data could be awkward for Modi's Hindu nationalist government to explain with a general election looming and opinion polls already showing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party unlikely to keep its parliamentary majority. 
""It’s a very, very serious issue, and that is the why the government didn’t want this data to come out in the public domain,"" said former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha.

A report released by the All India Manufacturers' Organisation said last month 3.5 million jobs had been lost since 2016, mainly due to demonetization and rising working costs after the launch of the national tax.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",Factory activity shrinks across Asia as cooling China threatens global growth,"By Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factory activity shrank across much of Asia in January, falling to the weakest in years in several countries and adding to worries that trade tariffs and cooling demand in China pose an increasing threat to global growth.
The weak Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings reinforce expectations that central banks in Asia will put any further interest rate hikes on hold this year.
In some countries, such as China, Australia and India, there is even chatter about potential rate cuts.
Trade-focused Asia appears to be suffering the most visible loss of momentum so far, but the euro zone economy is stuck in low gear and many emerging markets are sputtering.
The U.S. economy, while a bit wobbly of late, still looks set to post solid growth, though softer than last year's pace.
That puts pressure on Beijing to come up with more stimulus measures at its upcoming parliamentary meeting in March and find common ground with the United States to prevent their trade war from escalating, with a truce expiring next month.
""The slowing down of the manufacturing sector in Asia continues,"" said Irene Cheung, Asia strategist at ANZ.
""A lot depends on whether the U.S. and China come to a reasonable deal. Then we can actually avert this potential trade recession, but at the moment it's all tentative.""
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as Trump and his top trade negotiator both cited substantial progress in two days of high-level talks.
Trump, speaking at the White House during a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, said he was optimistic that the world's two largest economies could reach ""the biggest deal ever made.""
Meanwhile, bleak factory gauges suggests that the global economy will get worse before it gets better.
China's factory activity shrank by the most in almost three years in January as new orders slumped further and output fell, the private Caixin/Markit PMI survey showed. The numbers were weaker than Thursday's official PMI survey.
Taiwan posted its weakest readings since September 2015, South Korea the joint-lowest since November 2016 and Indonesia the first contraction in a year.
Japan's factory activity was the slowest in 29 months, with weakening exports and output suggesting it could soon fall into contraction. Manufacturers in the world's No.3 economy are facing both falling exports and a likely slump in domestic demand when the country's sales tax is hiked in October.
Freight rates for dry-bulk and container ships, carriers of most of the world's raw materials and finished goods, have plunged over the last six months.
The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of ship transport costs for materials like iron ore and coal, has fallen by 47 percent since mid-2018, when the main tariffs were imposed.
A Reuters poll of hundreds of economists from around the world showed a synchronized global economic slowdown was under way, with growth forecasts cut for 33 of 46 economies.
The International Monetary Fund last week cut its world growth forecasts for this year and next and said failure to resolve protectionism could further destabilize the slowing global economy.
Those concerns were reinforced on Monday by sales warnings from  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Nvidia Corp, coming on the heels of similar alarms raised by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and a host of chipmakers.
STIMULUS
Veteran China watchers typically advise taking its data early in the year with a pinch of salt, suspecting the trends may be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays.
Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which begin on Feb. 4 this year.
However, workers, business owners and labor activists have told Reuters that companies are shutting earlier than usual as the trade war bites, with some likely to close for good.
So far, China has fast-tracked infrastructure projects, cut taxes and pumped liquidity into the financial system to help keep cash-starved firms afloat. It has also been guiding down borrowing costs.
Investors are closely watching to see if Beijing unveils more fiscal stimulus during the upcoming parliamentary meeting in March, including bigger tax cuts, though the effects of policy easing are not expected to steady the economy until the second half of the year.
Chinese leaders, with an eye on a mountain of debt, have vowed they will not resort to massive stimulus like that deployed in past downturns. But some analysts believe more aggressive measures such as rate cuts are possible if conditions sharply deteriorate.
""Although we believe (China's) GDP growth will eventually bottom out, markets do not appear to have factored in such a sharp slowdown and may still be putting, in our opinion, too much faith in the efficacy of government support,"" economists at Nomura said in a recent note.
Even then, some economists say support measures may only steady activity in China and not produce a strong rebound in its demand like that which helped pull the global economy out of recession after the financial crisis.
""The global outlook is a bit more at risk from China today than it was, say, two or three years ago,"" said Sonal Desai, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Fixed Income.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 08:55PM ET</span>",China's manufacturing sector shrinks more than expected in January - Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, Feb 1 (Reuters) - China's factory activity shrank by the most in almost three years in January as new orders slumped further and output fell, a private survey showed, reinforcing fears a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy is deepening. 
The gloomy readings were more downbeat than an official survey on Thursday, which also showed growing strains on China's manufacturing sector, a key source of growth and jobs.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for January, released on Friday, fell a second straight month, reaching 48.3 - its worst reading since February 2016 - from 49.7 in December. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast only a marginal dip for January to 49.5, just below the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
Taken together, the private and official factory PMIs suggest China's economy continued to lose momentum at the start of the year, which was widely expected, with small and medium-sized firms under the most stress despite a slew of government support measures for the private sector. 
New orders - an indicator of future activity - also contracted for the second straight month, to 47.3, the lowest reading since September 2015, with companies reporting weak market demand despite the most aggressive price discounting in three years. 
Softer demand hit factory output, which contracted for the first time in 31 months. Factories cut jobs for the 63nd month in a row.
Purchasing activity declined for the first time in 20 months, likely due to a lack of new work and lower production requirements. The last time purchasing contracted at a faster pace was in December 2015. 
Chinese authorities have been fast-tracking infrastructure projects and cutting import tariffs in a bid to rekindle domestic demand, but the moves will take time to kick in and many analysts believe the economy will not stabilize until the middle of this year. 
""On the whole, countercyclical economic policy hasn't had a significant effect,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a commentary accompanying the data release.
Domestic demand had already been weakening before the United States and China in 2018 started to impose tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's exports, as a regulatory crackdown on risky lending was pushing up borrowing costs.
In contrast to the gloomy indicators, the Caixin survey showed that export orders increased slightly in January, ending a nine-month streak of declines. 
Zhong of CEBM said the pick-up was mainly due to positive sentiment from a temporary truce achieved during a meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in Argentina on Dec. 1.
On Wednesday, the United States and China opened high-level talks aimed at bridging their deep differences over China's intellectual property and technology transfer practices and easing their tariff dispute.
Even if there's a deal to end the trade war and shore up confidence, analysts say it would be no panacea for China's economic woes.
Business conditions in general are seen to get worse before they get better.
""China is likely to launch more fiscal and monetary measures and speed up their implementation. Yet the stance of stabilizing leverage and strict regulation hasn't changed, which means the weakening trend of China's economy will continue,"" said Zhong.
The Caixin/Markit survey focuses mostly on smaller businesses.

It suggested small and mid-sized firms were seeing a sharper deterioration in business conditions than larger companies, a trend that policymakers have repeatedly tried to address through special loan programs and steps to reduce operating costs.

242,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 07:35PM ET</span>",Japan's January factory activity weakens to 29-month low as export orders tumble: PMI,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity grew at the slowest pace in 29 months in January as export orders shrank sharply, a business survey showed on Friday, adding to signs that the U.S.-China trade war is inflicting more pressure on the slowing global economy.
The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 52.6 in December, though it was up slightly from a preliminary reading of 50.0.
The index remained just above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis, but weakening exports and output suggest it could soon swing into contraction.
The grim factory readings from the world's third-largest economy ""brought bad news for the global trade cycle at the start of 2019, with new export orders falling at the sharpest rate in two-and-a-half years,"" said Joe Hayes, Economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Anecdotal evidence suggested that sales of goods relating to semi-conductors had particularly suffered, which bodes ill for other Asian exporters.""
The final index for new export orders was 46.0, down slightly from a preliminary reading and showing the fastest contraction in 2-1/2 years. Some survey manufacturers reported fewer sales to China and the United States.
Weaker demand from domestic and international customers prompted Japanese manufacturers to cut output for the first time in 2-1/2 years and to scale back purchases of raw materials and other inputs.
Business confidence weakened for the eighth month in a row.
Japan's export-oriented economy is sensitive to changes in global demand, particularly in neighboring China, its largest trading partner. The Sino-U.S. trade war has disrupted supply chains on both sides of the Pacific, particularly for electronics.
Japan's exports in December fell the most in more than two years and there are worries they will fall even further if the U.S. carries out its threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2 if a trade deal cannot be reached in current negotiations.
The outlook for domestic demand in Japan was already looking shaky this year, with a sales tax hike planned for October.

Analysts polled by Reuters say the chances of a slide into recession are growing, though most believe the country will still eke out very modest economic growth in the coming fiscal year.

The Institute of Directors said 11 percent of firms - chiefly larger companies - had shifted some activities overseas while another 18 percent were planning to or actively considering it.
Sixty-two percent said they had no intention of moving because of Brexit.
""It brings no pleasure to reveal these worrying signs, but we can no more ignore the real consequences of delay and confusion than business leaders can ignore the hard choices that they face in protecting their companies,"" Edwin Morgan, the IoD's interim director general, said.
""The UK's hard-won reputation as a stable, predictable environment for enterprise is being chipped away.""
With two months left until Britain is due to leave the EU, investors have urged the government to ensure an orderly exit from the club it joined in 1973.
The IoD declared itself neutral ahead of Britain's referendum on its EU membership in 2016 but it has warned since then of the potential costs of leaving the bloc.
British lawmakers on Tuesday instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to reopen a Brexit treaty she struck with the European Union to replace an Irish border arrangement - and promptly received a flat rejection from Brussels.
The IoD survey showed financial and insurance companies were most likely to have already shifted some operations away from Britain, followed by manufacturers and professional, technical and scientific firms.
Most businesses which have relocated or are considering it said they were moving to countries in the EU.

The survey of 1,202 firms and was conducted between Jan. 17 and 19.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China, the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries, slashed its holdings of U.S. government debt for a sixth straight month in November, Treasury Department data released on Thursday showed.
China had $1.121 trillion in U.S. Treasuries in November, down from $1.138 trillion in October. The decline brought China's Treasury holdings to the lowest level since May 2017, the data showed.
Even so, the world's second largest economy remains the largest holder of U.S. Treasuries outside the United States.
""It can be for any number of reasons, but China is not doing this for political purposes,"" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.
The reduction in U.S. Treasury holdings comes as China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly rose in November to $3.062 trillion. That was the first gain since July and compared with a fall of $33.93 billion in October.
At the same time, the Chinese yuan rose 0.2 percent against the dollar in November, the first monthly rise since March. China typically sells U.S. Treasuries to support a weakening local currency.
Even though China's Treasury holdings declined, DRW's Brien said China may be holding some of its U.S. debt in other countries such as Belgium.
Data showed that Belgium saw an increase in Treasuries to $173 billion in November, from $169.7 billion the previous month.
Japan, on the other hand, saw its stash of Treasuries increase to $1.036 trillion in November, from $1.018 trillion in the previous month. Prior to the November rise, Japan had been paring Treasury holdings for three straight months.
Overall, foreign holdings of Treasury securities rose marginally to $6.204 trillion, from $6.2 trillion in October.
Data also showed an outflow in U.S. Treasuries for the month of November to the tune of $9.28 billion, following a modest inflow of $1.72 billion in October.
Foreign official institutions including central banks sold $33.29 billion in Treasuries, offsetting purchases of $24.64 billion from private investors.
The report also showed foreigners in November bought net long-term U.S. securities for a fifth straight month, totaling $37.6 billion, from $31.9 billion in October.
Foreigners, however, sold $5.6 billion in U.S. stocks in November, from outflows of $22.16 billion in the previous month. Foreign investors have sold U.S. equities for seven straight months.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 11:57AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims jump to near one-and-a-half year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits surged to near a 1-1/2-year high last week, but economists dismissed the jump as a fluke and said temporary factors, including a partial government shutdown, were to blame.
A strike by teachers in California, cold weather and difficulties adjusting the data around moving holidays like Martin Luther King Jr. Day also likely were factors in the spurt in claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday.
""We are skeptical the rise could reflect a true weakening in the labor market given that there are few other signs of weaker labor markets in January,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economic in New York. ""Nonetheless, if we maintain this higher level of jobless claims in the coming weeks, that would indicate a pickup in layoff activity.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 53,000 to a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended Jan. 26, the highest level since September 2017, the Labor Department said. The rise was also the largest since September 2017.
Claims dropped to 200,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since October 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to only 215,000 in the latest week. 
The claims data covered the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, which occurred later this year than in the past. Economists believe non-federal government workers who were temporarily unemployed during the longest government shutdown in the country's history likely helped to boost claims last week. 
The surge in claims came amid a recent deterioration in business and consumer confidence, which was partly blamed on a five-week government shutdown that has since ended. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates steady but said it would be patient in lifting borrowing costs further this year in a nod to growing uncertainty over the economy's outlook. The U.S. central bank removed language from its December policy statement that risks to the outlook were ""roughly balanced.""
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 5,000 to 220,250 last week. 
The claims data has no bearing on January's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, non-farm payrolls likely increased by 165,000 jobs in January after jumping by 312,000 in December.
The 35-day government shutdown is not expected to have an impact on January's job growth, as workers who were furloughed will be paid retroactively together with colleagues who worked without pay. However, those workers who stayed at home during the shutdown are expected to temporarily push up the unemployment rate in January.
The dollar fell against most major currencies, dropping to a two-week low versus the yen, pressured by the Fed's cautious economic outlook. U.S. Treasury yields fell, while stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher.
STEADY WAGE GAINS
Underscoring the labor market's strength, another report on Thursday from the Labor Department showed its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter after rising 0.8 percent in the July-September period. 
The fourth quarter rise lifted the year-on-year rate of increase in labor costs to 2.9 percent, the biggest gain since June 2008, from 2.8 percent in the 12 months through September.
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter after advancing 0.9 percent in the prior period. They were up 3.1 percent in the 12 months through December. 
That was the biggest increase since June 2008 and followed a 2.9 percent gain in the year through September.
""It supports our view that the tightness in the labor market is generating upward pressure on compensation,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
While the labor market is on solid footing, manufacturing appears to be slowing. A third report on Thursday showed the MNI Chicago business barometer dropped 7.1 points to a reading of 56.7 in January as new orders tumbled to a two-year low. The survey's measure of production dropped to a 10-month low.
There was some good news on the housing market. The Commerce Department reported new home sales vaulted 16.9 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000 units. The surge erased October's 8.3 percent plunge in single-family home sales.
The November home sales report was delayed by the government shutdown, which affected the Commerce Department. 
The housing market struggled in 2018, weighed down by acute shortages of homes for sales, which boosted prices, as well as higher mortgage rates. But there are glimmers of hope as house price inflation has slowed significantly and mortgage rates have eased after shooting up last year. 
Supply, however, still remains tight.

""We expect a further rise in new home sales during 2019 as homebuyers look to new builds, with inventory conditions for existing homes still extremely tight,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.7 percent after an unrevised 0.8 percent rise in the third quarter, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.9 percent, the biggest gain since June 2008, from 2.8 percent in the 12 months through September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI rising 0.8 percent in the October-December period.
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter after advancing 0.9 percent in the prior period. Wages and salaries were up 3.1 percent in the 12 months through December.
That was the biggest increase since June 2008 and followed a 2.9 percent gain in the year through September. A tightening labor market is gradually pushing up wage growth, with employers raising compensation to retain and attract workers.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation.
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday but said it would be patient in lifting borrowing costs further this year as it pointed to rising uncertainty about the economy's outlook. The U.S. central bank described the labor market as ""having continued to strengthen.""
Private sector wages and salaries rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter after increasing 0.8 percent in the prior period. They were up 3.1 percent in the 12 months through December after rising by the same margin in the year through September.
State and local government wages increased 0.6 percent after advancing 0.9 percent in the third quarter.

Benefits for all workers jumped 0.7 percent in the October-December quarter after rising 0.4 percent in the third quarter. They were up 2.8 percent in the 12 months through December after rising 2.6 percent in the year through September.

In a report, Statistics Canada said gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 0.1% in November from a month earlier, in line with analysts’ expectations. That followed an expansion of 0.3% in October.
Both manufacturing and retail activity contracted in the month, with manufacturing posting its third decline in four months, the agency said. The construction sector softened for a sixth straight month, activity falling to its lowest level since the middle of 2017. 
The figures don't include the contribution of cannabis to the economy. Consumption was legalized at the end of October, but figures reflecting cannabis production and sales will only be included in Statistics Canada's data from the December report, which is due March 1.
Despite the slowdown, ING Chief International Economist James Knightley insisted that Canada’s economic fundamentals are still solid enough to allow the country’s central bank to move forward with policy tightening.
“The unemployment rate is at four-decade lows, core inflation has remained around the central bank's 2% target and we expect business activity (outside the energy sector) to improve. This is all good enough, in our view, to keep the Bank of Canada in hiking mode,” he said.
Knightley expects the BoC to follow through with two rate hikes this year in the third and fourth quarter, although he admits that “the risks are clearly skewed to the downside”."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investment in the British car industry halved last year due largely to uncertainty about future trade with the EU and surveys showed consumers and businesses were more anxious about the economic outlook as Britain heads towards a no-deal Brexit.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Thursday that investment in Britain's automotive sector was 589 million pounds ($770 million) last year, nearly 50 percent less than in 2017 and the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis. 
""Investment has effectively stalled,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes, who called on the government to avoid ""the permanent devastation"" of a no-deal exit by Britain from the European Union.
""A lot of that is on hold because until you see what the future is, do you have the confidence to invest in that plant when there is that sort of uncertainty?""
Production also fell, by 9 percent. 
The SMMT said it expected car production to fall another 3 percent in 2019, assuming an orderly Brexit with a transition period to minimize economic disruption.
Some 850,000 Britons are employed in the car industry. 
Britain is due to leave the EU, the world's biggest trading bloc, on March 29. Its lawmakers have rejected the withdrawal agreement Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with Brussels, leaving the country on course for an abrupt exit that could cause major disruptions to trade. 
As May headed back to Brussels on Thursday to demand changes to her divorce deal, leading EU lawmaker Danuta Hubner warned that the risk of a no-deal Brexit had grown.
Hubner told Reuters the bloc could offer Britain more assurances over the ""backstop"" aimed at preventing a hard border in Ireland in a political declaration on post-Brexit ties if London moves towards staying in a customs union with the EU. 
May wants to replace the emergency Irish border fix with unspecified ""alternative arrangements"", something the EU says is vague and not enough of a guarantee. 
""If there is no openness on the UK side to include those assurances in the political declaration on the future EU-UK ties, the process could mechanically take us to no-deal,"" Hubner said.
CONSUMER GLOOM
Other data on Thursday showed confidence among British consumers held at a 5-1/2 year low in January. Increasing gloom about the outlook for the next 12 months was offset by a small improvement in personal finances, the GfK index showed.
Surveys of businesses by the Confederation of British Industry and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank also gave a sobering outlook for the world's fifth-largest economy.
House prices, a key barometer of consumer confidence in Britain, rose by just 0.1 percent in annual terms in January, their weakest rise in nearly six years. 
Britain's housing market has slowed since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 when Nationwide estimated house prices were rising by around 5 percent a year.
But warnings by former finance minister George Osborne that a ""Leave"" vote would hit the value of people’s homes by up to 18 percent have not materialized.
That has led many advocates of Brexit to dismiss as a continued ""Project Fear"" current warnings that a no-deal scenario could cause severe disruptions to food and medical supplies, transportation and manufacturing.
But the SMMT's Hawes pinned the fall in automotive industry investment firmly on the uncertainties surrounding Brexit. 
""I think the numbers give the lie to that accusation: investment figures, production figures,"" said Hawes. 

""If it's 'Project Fear', then we're doing a good impression of it being a reality.""

252,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>","Italy fourth-quarter GDP contracts, throwing economy into recession","By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's economy contracted for the second consecutive quarter at the end of last year, throwing the country into recession in a setback for the new anti-establishment government.
Gross domestic product fell a quarterly 0.2 percent between October and December, following a 0.1 percent decline in the third quarter, and was up 0.1 percent on an annual basis, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported on Thursday.
The fourth quarter decline was steeper than expected. A Reuters survey of analysts had pointed to a 0.1 percent fall quarter-on-quarter and a 0.3 percent year-on-year rise. 
Analysts often define two straight quarters of declining GDP as a ""technical"" recession, though the Italian economy grew in 2018 as a whole and is expected to expand modestly this year.
The data confirmed Italy's customary position among the growth laggards of the euro zone. The 19-nation bloc grew a listless 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, Eurostat said, in line with market expectations.
That was the same rate as in the third quarter, which had been the lowest for four years, while the euro zone's 1.2 percent year-on-year expansion was a new five-year low.
The data presents a quandary for the European Central Bank, which ended its bond-buying stimulus program late last year and risks running low on firepower as the economy slows. 
In December the ECB forecast fourth quarter growth of 0.4 percent, double the final outturn, and its full-year 2019 forecast of 1.7 percent already looks ambitious. 
The Italian government which took office in June last year was quick to blame its center-left predecessors for the latest slump. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the data ""certified the failure of the entire political class which Italians sent packing"" at last year's election.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said government measures would ensure a firm recovery from the second half of this year.
Conte pointed out the euro zone's third-largest economy has been weakening since early 2017 and has recently been hit by a slowdown in main trading partners such as China and Germany.
Critics say the coalition parties worsened the situation by fighting with Brussels over fiscal policy, damaging market confidence which pushed up Italy's borrowing costs and hurt the economy.
WEAK DOMESTIC DEMAND 
Over the whole of 2018, growth came in at 1 percent, down from 1.6 percent in 2017.
In the third quarter, GDP contracted by an unrevised 0.1 percent, the first fall in four years, and rose 0.6 percent annually, revised down from a previously reported 0.7 percent.
ISTAT said the quarterly contraction at the end of the year was due to a fall in domestic demand, which outweighed a positive contribution from trade flows.
It gave no numerical breakdown of components with its preliminary estimate, but said industry and agriculture had been negative, while the service sector was ""substantially stable"".
The government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League has targeted GDP growth of 1 percent this year, but most independent bodies expect it to be little more than half that.
A Reuters survey of 46 economists published this month forecast 2019 growth of 0.7 percent. The Bank of Italy and the International Monetary Fund both forecast 0.6 percent.
""We expect GDP to expand by 0.5 percent in 2019, and this underpins our expectation Italy's GDP will return to modestly positive quarterly growth during the year,"" UniCredit economist Loredana Federico said after the Q4 figures.
""Focus now seems to have shifted towards further weakness from abroad, away from domestic-specific weakness.""
The coalition approved an expansionary budget in December aimed at heading off the growing threat of recession.
The budget, which was watered down after European Commission objections it would not lower Italy's high public debt, features a new income support scheme for the poor and allows people to retire earlier. It also slashes taxes for the self-employed.
ISTAT said in November the budget would support private consumption this year, and forecast growth of 1.3 percent, but since then the international outlook has darkened. 

Italy has been the euro zone's most sluggish economy since the start of monetary union, and few analysts believe the budget can turn things around in the face of a broad European slowdown, trade tensions and Italy's chronically stagnant productivity.

(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's economy grew at a pace of 2.21 percent in 2018, buoyed by strong oil sector growth and recovering from a contraction in 2017 when the economy was hurt by weak oil prices and austerity measures, government data showed on Thursday.
In 2017, it shrank 0.74 percent, the first annual decline since the global financial crisis nearly a decade earlier.
The oil sector grew 2.85 percent, from a contraction in 2017, while the non-oil sector grew 2.05 percent, the data showed https://www.stats.gov.sa/sites/default/files/mwshrt_lhsbt_lqwmy_2018m.pdf.
The government did not break down the fourth-quarter data, but full-year growth figures suggested economic growth accelerated in the last quarter.
""We might be looking at GDP growth of 4.0 percent, which was driven primarily by the oil sector, but we might have also seen a fairly strong rebound in private sector growth which I would estimate at 3.2 percent - the fastest since Q42015,"" said Jean-Paul Pigat, head of research at Lighthouse Research.
The economy grew 2.5 percent in the third quarter.
Saudi officials have predicted a gradual acceleration in growth of the non-oil economy in 2019 as the government decided to boost spending.
Last month Riyadh released a state budget for 2019 that would increase spending by 7 percent from this year's actual level. Investment spending and bonuses for state employees in the budget could revive the private sector.
""Headline real GDP growth is forecast to moderate in 2019 with the OPEC-led oil production cuts, and at this point we only expect a modest increase in non-oil growth,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russia-led allies agreed last month to slash oil production by more than the market had expected.
Malik said a key issue for the economy in 2019 will be the degree of progress that will be made on the investment program of the sovereign wealth Public Investment Fund. 
The PIF is backing some of the biggest projects in Saudi Arabia such as the $500 billion NEOM mega economic zone, which the government has said will start developing its first area in the first quarter of 2019.

The 26,500 square km (10,230 square mile) high-tech hub, first revealed in 2017, will include projects powered by wind and solar energy and sports halls, concert facilities and restaurants.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy stuck to its lowest pace of growth in four years in the final three months of 2018, with the rate of expansion in the year as a whole also the slowest since 2014, data showed on Thursday.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in the 19 countries sharing the single currency rose by 0.2 percent in the quarter and by 1.2 percent year-on-year, the European statistics agency Eurostat said in its first estimate.
Both figures matched the average forecasts of economists polled by Reuters.
The quarter-on-quarter rate in the fourth quarter matched that of the third quarter, which had been the lowest rate since the second quarter of 2014. The year-on-year rate of 1.2 percent was a new five year low.
In 2018 as a whole, the euro zone economy expanded by 1.8 percent, down from growth in the past three years of 2 percent or above.
The new data could prompt the European Central Bank to cut its growth forecast of 1.7 percent for 2019, given that the increase in the fourth quarter was only half of what it forecast in December.
The data also followed a slew of weak figures, issued earlier on Thursday, showing the global economy slowing due to headwinds ranging from a Sino-U.S. trade war and uncertainty surrounding Britain's decision to quit the European Union. 
German retail sales fell at their steepest rate since 2007 in December and, in Britain, car production last year suffered the biggest drop since the 2008-9 recession and house prices stagnated in January.
China's vast manufacturing sector shrank for the second straight month in January and factory output in Japan also fell for a second month in December, underlining a warning by the central bank about growing risks from slowing global growth and the Sino-U.S. trade war.
In the United States, consumer confidence has dropped, wholesale prices weakened, financial markets wobbled and home sales fallen in the six weeks since the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates in response to a ""strong"" U.S. economy.
In separate data released by Eurostat on Thursday, unemployment in the euro zone, typically a figure that lags the economic cycle, remained at 7.9 percent. It equaled its lowest rate in more than 10 years in December and matched economists' forecasts.
The jobless rates fell slightly in Italy and Spain, which still have the highest unemployment levels in the euro zone after Greece. In the whole euro zone 75,000 fewer people were out of work than in November. 
In the wider 28-country European Union, the jobless rate was 6.6 percent in December, also unchanged from November.

In a report, Eurostat said that GDP rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in the October to December period, matching the prior reading and in line with the consensus forecast.
Year-on-year, GDP in the single currency bloc slowed to 1.2% in the fourth quarter, compared to the 1.6% expansion seen in the previous quarter.
Economists had expected growth of 1.2%.
“Although temporary effects from German car sector bottlenecks explain some of the growth drag, the overall economic environment, with a Chinese slowdown, Brexit and fragile risk sentiment in financial markets, also weigh on growth prospects,” economists from Danske Bank explained.
On a more positive note, ING economists pointed out that consumer confidence is no longer falling, “which at least offers some hope that it cannot only go downhill from here”.
“At this point, we think the risk of a recession this year still remains low, unless all downward risks materialize,” ING's chief eurozone economist Peter Vanden Houte said.
“That said, the best now lies behind us, and eurozone growth should come out between 1.0% and 1.5% in 2019, nothing to cheer about,"" they argued, adding that they now expect the European Central Bank to offer a new round of long-term financing for banks - known as TLTROs - by June."

Nineteen analysts polled by Reuters had given an average forecast for a January inflation rate of 1.3 percent.
Data this week showed that a key gauge of the market's long-term expectations for inflation within the euro zone area had fallen to its lowest level since late 2016.

Inflation expectations in the euro zone bloc have fallen since early November, illustrating concerns that the European Central Bank (ECB) may struggle to meet its target for having inflation at close to but below 2 percent for the euro zone.

The fall in real terms was far weaker than a Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.6 percent drop. 
Sales also fell by 2.1 percent year-on-year, Germany's Federal Statistics Office said in a statement.
A spokesman said the fall, the sharpest since 2007, was partly due to the comparison with a strong November which was boosted by pre-Christmas shopping and one-off discount days like Black Friday. 
Household spending has become a key growth driver in recent years as Germans benefit from record-high employment and low borrowing costs but retail sales are a volatile indicator often subject to revision. 

The figures follows a pickup in consumer sentiment heading into February, shown by the GfK indicator this week, although shoppers grew more pessimistic about the economy due to worries about trade disputes and Brexit. German inflation remained moderate in January.

Nationwide said the housing market's loss of momentum reflected the unusually ""uncertain economic outlook"" but if the economy grew modestly, house prices on a national level would probably grow ""at a slow single-digit pace"" this year.
In monthly terms, prices rose by 0.3 percent.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but Prime Minister Theresa May, under pressure from her own Conservative Party, says she wants to change a key part of the withdrawal agreement she struck with the rest of the bloc.
That has raised the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit.
Britain's housing market has slowed since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 when Nationwide estimated house prices were rising by around 5 percent a year.
Surveys published earlier on Thursday showed British consumers remained their gloomiest in five-and-a-half years and businesses were also downbeat. 
Economists who took part in a Reuters poll of economists ahead of Nationwide's data had expected prices to be flat when compared with January last year and to rise by 0.2 percent in monthly terms.

260,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 11:48PM ET</span>","China’s Factory Activity Rises Slightly in January, Still Below 50-Mark","Investing.com - China’s factory activity rose slightly in January but stayed below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.
January’s official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was up a tick at 49.5 from 49.4 in December and better than the expected 49.3.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector from the previous month, while one below 50 represents contraction. Activity in China’s manufacturing sector has shrunk for the second straight month.
Meanwhile, the services PMI for January came in at 54.7, better than the 53.8 reported in the previous month.
Despite the better-than-expected PMI numbers, some economists said the data still suggests a weakening Chinese economy, and that China might be at risk of a sharper-than-expected slowdown if the trade war with the U.S. drags on.
""While the official manufacturing PMI didn't weaken any further in January, it still suggests that the economy lost momentum at the start of the year,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note that was cited by CNBC.

Anxiety about cooling demand in China is rippling through the world's financial markets and weighing on other Asian economies after a string of sales warnings from heavy machinery producer  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) to iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Even with increasing government efforts to spur activity, concerns are growing that China may be at risk of a sharper-than-expected slowdown if the trade war with the United States drags on. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 49.5 in January from 49.4 in December, but the change was marginal and the reading was still below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Thursday. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the gauge would dip to 49.3.
The gloomy findings suggest the Chinese economy got off to a rocky start in the new year, as many analysts had predicted after GDP growth cooled to a 28-year low last year.
That could add a sense of urgency to current trade talks, as high-level Chinese and U.S. officials meet this week in a pivotal effort to hammer out a deal before an early March deadline that could usher in sharply higher U.S. tariffs.
The two-day talks in Washington, which began on Wednesday, and are expected to be tense. 
A breakdown of the factory PMI showed weakness came from falling new orders. Manufacturers also continued to cut jobs, a trend Beijing is closely watching as its weighs more support measures.
New orders -- an indicator of future activity -- pointed to further pressure in coming months. The sub-index fell to 49.6 from 49.7 in December, the second consecutive month in the contraction territory, amid persistently weak demand at home and abroad. New export orders shrank for a eighth straight month on faltering external demand, though the sub-index ticked up slightly to 46.9 from the previous month's 46.6. 
Despite weaker orders, the output sub-index edged up to 50.9 from 50.8.
Veteran China watchers typically advise taking its data early in the year with a pinch of salt, suspecting the trends may be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays.
Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which begin on Feb. 4 this year. But workers, business owners and labor activists have told Reuters that companies are shutting earlier than usual as the trade war bites, with some likely to close for good.
Bleak data ahead of an annual meeting of parliament in March could raise the possibility that Beijing may speed up or intensify its stimulus efforts in 2019, after a slew of measures last year that analysts said were modest by Chinese standards.
Still, many analysts believe conditions in China are likely to get worse before they get better, as support policies will take time to work their way through the economy.
Some economists believe growth could even dip below 6 percent in the first half -- from 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter -- before stabilizing later in the year.
One bright note in Thursday's data was an acceleration in service sector activity for the second straight month, reflecting some pockets of strength in the economy despite worries about faltering consumer demand.

The nation’s immigration figures have been revised sharply lower after the statistics agency adopted new methodology, showing that net arrivals were about 45,000 fewer in the past four years than previously estimated. In a country of just 4.9 million people -- as far as we know -- that’s left analysts pondering: what does this mean for jobs and economic growth?
It could be significant. Less migrants means pressure on the property market isn’t as heavy as expected, while gauges of productivity and economic growth per capita will need to be revised higher. Fewer job-seekers could also ease pressure on wages, although economists say the labor market remains tight and there are no immediate implications for easier monetary policy.
On the other hand, policy makers have been taken aback that the nation’s jobless rate has been declining in the face of strong population growth while wage inflation has been benign. The new profile for immigration appears to offer an explanation.
“We have been constantly surprised by the strength of the labor market given how high immigration was supposed to be,” said Craig Ebert, senior economist at Bank of New Zealand in Wellington. “Going forward, that means you don’t have to forecast such strong growth in employment to absorb the number” of new arrivals.
The new methodology tracks peoples’ actual movements across the border to determine their migrant status, rather than relying on intentions based on departure and arrival cards.
The nation’s net immigration in the four years through October 2018 was about 220,000 persons, according to the revised data released last week. Annual arrivals have been falling steadily from a revised peak of almost 64,000 in mid-2016.
Statistics New Zealand expects to make some changes and revisions to fourth-quarter population estimates due in mid-February, labor market analyst Katy Auberson said in an emailed response to questions. While the changes will also flow into working-age population estimates, the fourth-quarter numbers -- the basis of next week’s jobs report -- aren’t affected, she said.
“It doesn’t get rid of migration as a story in the economy,” said Ebert. “It’s hard to see the unemployment rate jerking up because that’s not what we are hearing from companies, who see the market getting tighter if anything.”

265,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 02:43PM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls rise strongly; housing market struggling,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased solidly in January, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite a recent easing in consumer and business confidence that has suggested a loss of momentum in the economy.
The strong hiring shown in the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Wednesday also suggested there had been minimal impact on the labor market from the just-ended 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government. 
Other data showed contracts to buy existing homes tumbled to a more than 4-1/2-year low in December.
Amid growing uncertainty over the economy's outlook, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept benchmark U.S. interest rates steady and said it would be patient in lifting borrowing costs further this year.
""It looks like the labor market remains in solid shape despite significant weakening in business and consumer sentiment in recent months and we don't see much evidence that the government shutdown spilled over into the private labor market in an especially meaningful way,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 213,000 in January after surging 263,000 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 178,000 in January.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for December scheduled for release on Friday.
While the ADP report is not considered a reliable predictor of the private payrolls portion of the government's employment report because of differences in methodology, it was in line with other market data, including weekly filings for unemployment benefits, that have suggested a healthy jobs market.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 165,000 jobs in January after jumping 312,000 in December. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.9 percent.
The dollar fell against basket of currencies on the Fed's dovish statement on interest rates, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street extended gains.
HOME SALES CONTRACTS FALL
In a separate report on Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 2.2 percent to 99.0, the weakest reading since April 2014. 
Contracts to purchase homes have now declined for three straight months. Pending home sales become sales after a month or two, and last month's drop suggested further weakness in existing home sales after they hit a three-year low in December.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 0.5 percent. Pending home sales fell 9.8 percent from a year ago, the 12th straight month of annual decreases. Contracts fell in the South, Northeast and Midwest. They rose in the West.
""The December report suggests a further deterioration in home sales,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington. 
The weak housing report added to surveys showing a plunge in consumer confidence in January and some regional Fed manufacturing surveys that have suggested a slowdown in economic activity in the fourth quarter and early in 2019.
Economists believe U.S. economic growth cooled in the fourth quarter from the July-September period's brisk 3.4 percent annualized rate. 
The advance fourth-quarter GDP report, which was scheduled for release on Wednesday, has been delayed as the government shutdown prevented the collection of source data by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau.
Despite the weakness in signed contracts and sales, the outlook for the housing market is improving amid a moderation in house price inflation. 
A report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 4.7 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, the smallest gain since January 2015, after advancing 5.0 percent in October.

The slowdown in house prices comes at a time when the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is hovering at a nine-month low of 4.45 percent, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. This, together with improving supply, could help to support the housing market this year after it struggled in 2018.

266,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 02:27PM ET</span>","Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates on Hold, Vows 'Patient' Approach","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday and vowed to take a patient approach to rate hikes in the wake of slowing global growth and subdued inflation.
The Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight funds rate in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.
The move was widely expected. More than 90% of traders expected the central bank to stand pat on rates, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
In a dovish move, the Federal Reserve opted for a more cautioned tone in its monetary policy statement. It ditched its preference to continue with ""gradual"" rate hikes, saying it can hold off on monetary policy tightening following a slowdown in global growth and muted inflation pressures.
""In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes,"" the Fed said.
On the balance sheet, the Fed said it ""is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.""
This comes just weeks after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank may be open to using all tools available to overcome any potential deterioration in economic conditions, including adjusting its balance sheet wind-down operation, which peaked at roughly $4.5 trillion in Jan. 2015, but has now narrowed to about $4 trillion.

The Fed believes the current path of policy action is ""appropriate,"" Powell said in the press conference that followed the decision. The Fed chief stressed the Fed Funds rate was the primary monetary policy tool, but said the central bank would be open to adjusting its balance sheet normalization if a more robust solution was needed.
In the weeks leading up to the decision, Federal Reserve members said they were partial to a wait-and-see approach before hiking rates in a bid to calm investor fears that the FOMC may overshoot on policy.
Those fears were underscored in wake of the central bank's previous meeting in December when the Fed hiked rates and served up a less dovish tone than many had expected, prompting sharp selling in the markets.
The Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged was made easier by the impact of the longest government shutdown in history. It not only hit economic growth, but also limited the amount of economic data available to assess the health of the underlying economy.
The five-week shutdown wiped off about $11 billion from the U.S. economy, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday. Most of the impact will be in the first quarter, which will see its annual growth rate reduced by about 0.4%.
The data that was at the Fed's disposal did little to inspire calls for another rate hike.
Consumer confidence, although still at historically high levels, dropped to an 18-month low in January. The deterioration in the underlying housing market continued at pace as pending and existing home sales fell to multi-year lows last month."

Gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent in seasonally adjusted terms in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three-month period. That compares to 0.8 percent growth in the third quarter, the INEGI statistics agency said.
""The slowdown in GDP growth in Q4 was driven entirely by a slump in industry,"" Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.
Robust growth in the services sector, which accounts for some 60 percent of total output, propped up the economy, said Glossop.
Compared to the same quarter a year earlier, Latin America's second-largest economy grew by 1.8 percent in unadjusted terms, versus 2.5 percent in the third quarter.
GDP grew by 1.9 percent versus a year earlier in seasonally adjusted terms in the fourth quarter, said INEGI.
Mexico's economy grew 2.0 percent during 2018 versus the previous year.
""It's no surprise that the economy decelerated in the fourth quarter since it's part of the historic curse Mexico suffers every six years when there is a change of government,"" said Alfredo Coutino, director of analysis for Latin America at Moody's Analytics.
Declining government spending as former president Enrique Pena Nieto prepared to leave office combined with the learning curve of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government after it took over on Dec. 1 dragged on growth, said Coutino.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",Working to 70 is not an easy fix to the retirement crisis,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - It may seem a simple solution to the brewing U.S. retirement crisis: Get people to work until 70 before retiring and 85 percent will have the money they need for retirement.
They will save more during additional years in jobs and leave existing savings untouched while getting paychecks; plus they have fewer years in retirement to cover living expenses with their savings, noted Alicia Munnell, director of Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
But despite the math that attracts economists and lawmakers worried about funding Social Security and Medicare, it turns out that it is not so easy.
James Poterba, an MIT economics professor, pointed to the problem at a Brookings Institution forum on the topic last week.
“Not everybody can work longer,” said Poterba, who is also president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He contrasted workers in physically demanding or unpleasant jobs to economists in academic offices comfortably churning out studies on Social Security fixes. 
While many professors cling to their jobs well into their 70s, research shows many people do not have that option.
The Urban Institute noted in a new study that about 10 percent of those over 50 had to leave their jobs because of health. But Urban Institute economist Richard W. Johnson, who studied work records of people over 50 in the federally funded Health and Retirement Study, said ageism is driving far more older workers away from their jobs, regardless of education, race or gender. 
Older workers also had trouble finding new jobs. Half had their income fall more than 42 percent, and only one in 10 ever earned as much as they had been making before losing their job. A third of those over 50 who lost jobs also had it happen again. 
“Even now, when the labor market is tight, ageism is still there,” Johnson said. 
ALTERNATIVES
While people may not make it to 70, economists recommended trying to work as long as possible. Stanford economist John Shoven has found that retiring at 66, instead of 62, can lift the standard of living by a third. 
One suggestion from Munnell to convince employers to keep older workers on the job longer: declare 70 the new full retirement age for Social Security instead of the 66-1/2 to 67 it is now.
Munnell explained that employers are sometimes afraid to hire people in their 50s because they fear that person will stay indefinitely to build up meager 401(k) savings. If the retirement age were 70, the employer would perhaps hire an older person, knowing the employee eventually would leave. 
But raising the retirement age is a political hot potato, mostly because people in lower-income and physically demanding jobs would receive less money if they claimed Social Security earlier than 70. President Donald Trump has promised not to alter Social Security.
Another idea proposed by Stanford economics professor John Shoven and Robert Clark, a North Carolina State University economics professor, is to relieve employers and employees of paying payroll tax toward Social Security for workers over 62.
Currently, both employees and employers face a payroll tax of 6.2 percent of earnings up to $132,900. As more older people work, Shoven and Clark argue higher income tax receipts could offset Social Security’s lost revenue.
Yet, Steve Goss, the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration, does not think those savings would be passed along to workers in higher wages or to increase the labor supply of older people. 

Also, if Social Security suffers a loss in revenue, younger workers might have to pay higher taxes, leaving them less able to save for their own retirement and perpetuating the cycle of the retirement readiness crisis.

Data released on Wednesday by the Federal Statistics Office and the GfK consumer research group suggested that household spending will cushion the negative impact of weaker trade on Europe's largest economy in light of tariff disputes and Brexit.
German consumer price inflation, harmonized to be comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, remained unchanged at 1.7 percent year-on-year, the Federal Statistics Office said.
KfW economist Joerg Zeuner said the slower rise in overall prices meant a gain in purchasing power for German consumers, though this alone would probably not be enough to offset growing concerns about the state of the economy.
The Economy Ministry said on Wednesday that headwinds from trade disputes and Britain's exit from the European Union would further slow the German economy this year after it expanded at the slowest rate in five years in 2018.
""At least, both private consumption and investment are withstanding the growing pessimism quite well for the time being,"" Zeuner said.
In another positive sign for household spending, a GfK survey showed that consumer sentiment picked up unexpectedly heading into February as shoppers became more optimistic about their incomes and were more willing to buy.
Presenting the government's reduced growth forecast of 1.0 percent for this year, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said domestic demand would remain the sole driver of growth in 2019, helped by an expected jump in net wages of 4.8 percent.

The government expects imports to rise by 4.0 percent this year, outstripping a predicted increase in exports of 2.7 percent. This means that net trade will be holding back overall economic growth by 0.3 percentage points.

Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment fell by more than expected to a two-year low in January as all components except consumers and the construction sector became more pessimistic about the bloc's prospects at the start of the year.
Euro zone economic sentiment slipped to 106.2 points in January from a slightly revised 107.4 in December, the European Commission said, marking the seventh consecutive monthly fall and the lowest level since November 2016.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a less sharp decline to 106.8, with a depressed mood among retailers providing an extra shove down.
The worse-than-expected sentiment numbers come a day before Eurostat's release of its first estimate for economic growth in the 19-member euro zone. It is seen holding at a modest 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2018. This would match the four-year low of the third quarter.
Sentiment in industry fell to 0.5 points in January from 2.3 in December, in line with market expectations.
The mood of consumers picked up to -7.9 after December's steep fall to -8.3.
However, retail trade sentiment slipped to -1.9 points in January from -0.1 in December.
Sentiment in services, a sector which produces two thirds of the euro zone GDP, went down to 11.0 points, almost matching expectations of a 11.1 reading.
A separate business climate indicator, which helps point to the phase of the business cycle, also decreased in January to 0.69 from 0.86 in December, below expectations of a drop to 0.75. This was the lowest reading since January 2017.

The annual growth rate in unsecured consumer lending weakened to 6.6 percent from 7.2 percent in November, the smallest increase since December 2014, the BoE figures showed.
There have been signs from many retailers that British households reined in their spending at the end of last year, faced with the possibility of the country leaving the European Union without a deal to smooth the economic shock.
Prime Minister Theresa May says she will seek changes to the Brexit deal she struck with other EU leaders last year but they have ruled out major alterations, leaving open the prospect of a no-deal Brexit in less than two months' time.
The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase edged down to 63,793 in December, the lowest number since April but above a median forecast of 63,000 in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's housing market stumbled in 2018 and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said earlier this month that its members had the most negative outlook for house sales over the coming three months since its records began in 1999.
BoE Governor Mark Carney has warned that in the event of a ""disorderly"" departure from the EU -- which is not the central bank's base-case scenario -- house prices could slump by 30 percent as part of a broader economic shock.
The BoE data showed net mortgage lending, which tends to lag behind approvals, at 4.112 billion pounds in December, up from 3.631 billion pounds in November.
The figures also showed a 687 million-pound increase in unsecured lending, the weakest increase since March of last year and below economists' forecasts of a rise of 800 million pounds.
Credit card lending rose by just 92 million pounds, the smallest increase since September 2014.
The BoE also said net gilt purchases by foreign investors totaled 11.960 billion pounds in December, compared with 2.418 billion pounds in November.

GfK market research group's consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, rose to 10.8 points heading into February from a revised 10.5 points the previous month. That beat the forecast of 10.3. 
Household spending has become a key growth driver in recent years as Germans benefit from record-high employment, hefty pay hikes and low borrowing costs.
""Rising income prospects and an increasing propensity to buy mean that the consumer climate is improving once more,"" Rolf Buerkl, a researcher for Nuremberg-based GfK, said in a statement. 
Income expectations also jumped to their highest level since August 2017 while willingness to make purchases rebounded after falling in December, helped by a stable labor market and rising incomes, GfK said.
However, trade disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies and deadlock in Britain regarding its expected departure from the European Union - which particularly weighs on exports - dragged consumers' economic expectations to the lowest level in almost two years.
The German economy grew by 1.5 percent in 2018, the weakest rate in five years and sources have said the government has cut its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 1.0 percent from 1.8 percent. 
GfK said it expected private consumption in Germany to grow by 1.5 percent in 2019.
But Buerkl warned that if the trade dispute were to escalate and hit export prospects harder, it would be a bad sign for Germany, adding: ""If this were to again increase workers' fears of job losses, it would have an adverse impact on the consumer climate, jeopardizing the forecast.""
The survey was conducted between Jan. 4 to 18.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the final quarter of 2018, the same rate registered in the previous three months, INSEE said.
The preliminary reading, which topped expectations for growth of only 0.1 percent in a Reuters poll of 32 economists, meant that the French economy grew 1.5 percent for all of 2018, short of the government's forecast for 1.7 percent.
In the fourth quarter, household spending, traditionally the motor of French growth, slowed to a standstill after 0.4 percent growth in the previous three months as Paris saw the worst street violence since the 1968 student protests.
Meanwhile, business investment also slowed sharply, to growth of only 0.3 percent in the quarter from 1.7 percent in the previous quarter as business confidence collapsed amid unrest that left many stores boarding up shopfronts in Paris.
Yet an end of the year spurt in export shipments helped lift growth with export growth of 2.4 percent outpacing import growth of 1.6 percent. 
As a result, foreign trade added 0.2 percentage points to overall growth, while business inventory drawdowns trimmed output back 0.1 percentage points.

Optimism about both prospects for the economy and in making hiring and investment decisions declined to match the lowest since June 2016, according to a survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation published Wednesday.
More than half were concerned about the availability of candidates for permanent jobs, with anticipated shortages of workers in health and social care, hospitality and engineering causing the most anxiety.
“The U.K. jobs market has been incredibly resilient but it cannot defy the effects of deep uncertainty indefinitely,” said REC Chief Executive Neil Carberry. A clear post-Brexit transition period and a sensible approach to EU immigration “would go a long way to allaying economic fears,” he said.
A separate report from the British Retail Consortium said that shop-price inflation accelerated to its fastest pace since 2013, led by food prices.

The drop in confidence reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday mirrors another survey earlier this month showing sentiment tumbling to its lowest level since President Donald Trump was elected more than two years ago, strengthening analysts expectations that the economy was losing momentum.
""There's no way the Trump economics team forecast of 3 percent growth is going to be accurate this year if consumers' spirits don't brighten up a little,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped 6.4 points to 120.2 this month, the lowest reading since July 2017. It blamed the third straight monthly decline in confidence to ""financial market volatility and the government shutdown.""
The survey's expectations measure tumbled to levels last seen in October 2016. The cutoff date for the Conference Board's survey was Jan. 17, in the midst of the shutdown which shuttered about one-quarter of federal agencies as of Dec. 22, impacting 800,000 government employees.
The longest shutdown in U.S. history ended on Friday when Trump and Congress agreed to temporary government funding - without money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the economy lost about $11 billion during the five-week shutdown. 
With the government shutdown over for now and financial markets stabilizing, some economists expect a rebound in confidence in the months ahead.
Others are not convinced, pointing out that the Conference Board's confidence index has shed 17.7 points over the past three months, the most since 2011.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, rose to 33.7 in January from to 33.3 in December but was below its peak of 34.2 in November. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
Consumers' views of the labor market over the next six months were less upbeat.
A LITTLE CHILLY
""There appears more to this than just the shutdown,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Things are looking a little chilly.""
The confidence survey adds to recent data showing home resales plummeting in December. Some regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys have weakened in January. Economists believe economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter from the July-September period's brisk 3.4 percent annualized rate.
The advance fourth-quarter GDP report, which was scheduled for release on Wednesday, has been delayed as the government shutdown prevented the collection of source data, including December retail sales, housing starts durable goods and trade figures. 
November construction spending, trade, business inventories, factory orders as well as new home sales reports were also impacted by the government's closure.
U.S. Treasury prices rose on the confidence data, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower amid concerns about the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks.
Other data on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 4.7 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, the smallest gain since January 2015, after advancing 5.0 percent in October.
House price inflation is slowing as demand cools and housing inventory rises. The moderation in house prices, together with an easing in mortgage rates should help support demand and lift the housing market this year after struggling for much of 2018.
""With the weakness across much of the housing data in 2018, we have seen the pace of house price appreciation moderate across a range of different measures,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 

""The house price data tend to lag many other housing indicators, and some of the more timely indicators have perked up a bit now that mortgage rates have declined over the past couple of months.""

There were 34,108 individual insolvencies in England and Wales during the fourth quarter, the most since the second quarter of 2010 and up 35 percent on a year ago, the government's Insolvency Service said on Tuesday.
The increase was driven by a record number of Individual Voluntary Arrangements -- agreements to repay creditors that are short of declaring bankruptcy.

The figures chime with other signs of vulnerability in Britain's consumer economy, coming two months before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union.
Official data earlier this month showed British shoppers cut back on spending in the three months to December for the first time since last spring.
The Insolvency Service said 3,949 businesses in England and Wales fell into financial distress during the fourth quarter, up 11 percent on a year ago, according to seasonally adjusted data that exclude ""bulk"" closures of personal service companies.
""After three years of relatively flat numbers, 2018 saw insolvencies creep back up to levels last seen in 2014,"" Stuart Frith, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3 said.
""The pressure point for businesses most frequently cited by our members is weak consumer demand. People just don't have much spare cash at the moment, reflected in the rise in the number of personal insolvencies also confirmed today.""
Last week Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said he was puzzled by widespread warnings that household debt in Britain had reached unsustainable levels.
Growth in household debt, rather than levels, had proven to be a better indicator of financial distress across different countries, Broadbent said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French consumer confidence levels rebounded in January from a slump in the previous month, though they remained well below average as the euro zone's second-biggest economy grapples with the impact of anti-government protests.
The INSEE national statistics agency said consumer confidence in January rose to 91 points from 86 in December, which had marked the lowest level since October, 2014.
Fifteen economists polled by Reuters forecast 88 points for the January level.
INSEE said there had been a pick-up among consumers who felt it was a good time to buy products, as French department stores held their New Year sales.
""The decline around the end of last year was linked to the ""yellow vest"" protests, in our view. And the sharp rebound in January suggests a normalization process is under way,"" wrote investment bank JP Morgan.
Nevertheless, INSEE said January's consumer confidence level remained below the long-term average of 100 points.
Others were also wary of the near-term outlook for the French economy, given the damage caused by the ""yellow vests"" - named after the high-visibility jackets all French motorists carry in their cars.
The ""yellow vest"" demonstrators on Saturday carried out their 11th consecutive weekend of protests, resulting in sporadic clashes with police across the country.
Moody's credit rating agency on Tuesday said the protests posed risks to French economic outlook, with the government forecasting growth of 1.7 percent for 2019.

""I have to say, I am surprised by the pick-up in consumer confidence for January, given that every weekend you see pictures of shops being closed and damage being done,"" said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>","China January factory activity seen shrinking further, raising global risks: Reuters poll","BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's vast manufacturing sector likely shrank for the second straight month in January, a Reuters poll showed, heightening concerns over the risks the Chinese slowdown poses to the global economy. 
Industrial bellwether  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) became the latest heavyweight multinational to warn of cooling demand in China this week, joining tech firms such as micro-chip makers and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
China's official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is forecast to dip marginally to 49.3 from December's 49.4, according to the median forecast of 33 economists.
The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. January's reading was the weakest since February 2016.
The data gives global investors their first look at business conditions in China at the start of the year, but this year it might be distorted by the week-long Lunar New Year break that begins on Feb. 4, analysts said. 
Businesses typically scale back operations or close for lengthy periods around the holidays. 
However, Reuters interviews with workers, business owners, labor activists and trade lawyers revealed some businesses are shutting earlier than usual this year as a prolonged trade war with the United States curtails orders.
Unless Washington and Beijing reach some sort of compromise in current negotiations that will relieve tariff pressures, more factories are likely to shutter their gates for good.
Bleak PMI readings would raise the possibility that Beijing may speed up and intensify its policy easing and stimulus efforts this year, after a series of measures in 2018, analysts said.
Still, many China watchers believe business conditions are likely to get worse in coming months before the impact of support steps starts to be felt. Some economists believe growth could even dip below 6 percent in the first half -- from 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter -- before stabilizing later in the year. 
Growth in the world's second-largest economy cooled to 6.6 percent in 2018 - the slowest in 28 years - from 6.8 percent in 2017.
Activity has been curbed by a regulatory crackdown on riskier lending and debt which led to a sharp slowdown in investment, and by escalating tit-for-tat trade tariffs with the United States that have disrupted China's supply chains and soured both business and consumer confidence.
A private survey - the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) - which focuses more on small and medium-sized Chinese firms - is also expected to show a deeper contraction in January, slipping to 49.5 from 49.7 in the previous month, marking the lowest since June 2016.
Policymakers have made repeated attempts to keep cash-starved private companies afloat and reduce the risk of sharper job losses.
But with sales and profits under pressure and some idle capacity already, analysts believe many factory owners are in no mood to make the new investments that Beijing needs to engineer a sustainable turnaround.
Profits at China's industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, data showed this week. 
STRUGGLING COMPANIES
Since last year, the government has ramped up infrastructure spending, reduced taxes and lowered bank's reserve requirements five times to help spur lending. December data suggested construction may be slowly picking up in response, but property and manufacturing investment are continuing to cool.
Investors are closely watching to see if Beijing unveils more fiscal stimulus during an annual parliamentary meeting in March, including bigger tax cuts.
JP Morgan expects a combination of easing measures to be announced this quarter, including 200-300 basis points of bank reserve cuts (100 bps of reductions came this month), a 2-percentage point cut in the value-added tax (VAT) rate and policies to boost sales of cars and home appliances.
VAT cuts are seen as the most important measure to revive investor confidence, global market strategist Chaoping Zhu said in a note. 
Sources have told Reuters that Beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6-6.5 percent this year from around 6.5 percent in 2018.

The official PMI survey is due out ‪on Jan. 31, along with a sister survey on services. The Caixin manufacturing PMI will come out ‪on Feb. 1 and its services PMI ‪on Feb. 3.

The nonpartisan agency said growth of GDP - a measure national economic output - would be curbed by a drop in consumer spending power and a fall in U.S. exports. Those declines would be only partly offset by an expected increase in output as domestic goods replace imports, the CBO said in its budget and economic outlook for 2019-2029. 
President Donald Trump's administration last year slapped tariffs on goods from China and other countries, as Trump sought better trade terms. The outlook for the impact of these tariffs, and retaliation from trading partners, was part of the CBO's updated budget forecasts.
The tit-for-tat tariff war with China has cost both countries billions of dollars. Global stocks were down on Monday after data showed profits at China's industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, the latest indication of the trade war's toll.
""U.S. tariffs reduce U.S. economic activity primarily by reducing the purchasing power of U.S. consumers' income as a result of higher prices and by making capital goods more expensive,"" the CBO said. 
Changes in trade policy both in the United States and overseas will reduce real U.S. exports by 0.5 percent by 2022, the agency said in its annual report. 
Real GDP is expected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019. That is slower than 2018's 3.1 percent growth in real GDP but still faster than expected, the CBO said. After this year, annual growth is expected to average 1.7 percent through 2023, below the office's projection of potential growth.
By 2022, the trade policy changes are expected to cut real consumption by 0.1 percent and real private investment by 0.3 percent, the agency said.
The longer-term impacts are particularly uncertain, the CBO said. The analysis did not take into account an increase in the tariff rate from 10 percent to 25 percent on certain Chinese imports scheduled for March 2019.
The ""changes in trade policy increase policy uncertainty among investors, which may further reduce U.S. output,"" the report said.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is due to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington this week. The two countries are trying to resolve deep differences over China's trade and intellectual property practices, industrial subsidies and market access to avert an increase in duties scheduled to take effect on March 2.

In its latest 10-year budget and economic outlook, the Congressional Budget Office said 2019 economic growth will also be affected by a projected slowdown in federal government purchases in the fourth quarter of 2019.
After this year, CBO estimates that the economy will grow at an annual average of 1.7 percent through 2023 and 1.8 percent to 2029.
Yearly budget deficits are expected to exceed $1 trillion beginning in 2022. But CBO said its cumulative deficit projection over the next decade is $1.2 trillion less than it was in early 2018, primarily because of legislative changes that included less emergency spending. 

CBO said that persistently large deficits will push federal debt held by the public to 93 percent of the economy in 2029, its highest level since just after World War Two, and to about 150 percent of the economy by 2049.

With the area's three biggest economies - Germany, France and Italy - barely growing last quarter and sentiment indicators heading lower, banks were expected to tighten lending, putting a further brake on growth.
Yet figures published by the European Central Bank on Monday remained at or near their post-crisis highs, supporting the ECB's argument that bloc was experiencing a slowdown and not a downturn or the start of a recession.
Household lending held steady at post-crisis high of 3.3 percent while corporate lending expanded by 4.0 percent, not far from its post-crisis peak of 4.3 percent hit in September.
ECB President Mario Draghi warned last week that the growth dip could be bigger and longer than previously feared but stuck to his previous view that the slowdown was temporary and not the beginning of a recession.
Still, markets now see almost no chance of an interest rate increase this year and instead see more stimulus measures from the ECB, possibly fresh loans to the bank sector, in part to maintain ample liquidity and the flow of credit to the corporate sector.
Still, lending may slow in the months ahead after banks in a key ECB survey recently predicted a slowdown and tighter lending standards.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, which often foreshadows future activity, jumped to 4.1 percent from 3.7 percent in November, beating market expectations for 3.8 percent. It was the best M3 reading since last June.

Profits of big industrial companies fell 1.9% on year to 680.83 billion yuan ($100.94 billion) in December, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. Profits of chemical, coal mining and non-ferrous metal sectors all slowed significantly in December, the data showed.
In November, industrial profits declined 1.8% from a year earlier. It was the first contraction in profits in nearly three years.
For the full year of 2018, China's industrial profit rose 10.3% to 6.64 trillion yuan ($986.37 billion), easing from 2017's 21%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Earnings at China's industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, putting pressure on policymakers to support industries hurt by slowing prices and weak factory activity amid a protracted U.S.-Sino trade war. 
The downbeat data points to more troubles ahead for the country's vast manufacturing sector already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures as China's economic growth slows to its weakest in nearly three decades.
China's economy expanded 6.6 percent in 2018 and growth is set to slow further this year as Beijing's efforts to reduce debt risks depress the property market and curb credit flows to the private sector, while a crackdown on pollution dents industrial activity.
Industrial profits in December fell 1.9 percent from a year earlier to 680.8 billion yuan ($100.9 billion), weighed down by weak factory-gate prices and soft demand, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday. This is on top of a decline of 1.8 percent in November - the first contraction in profits in nearly three years.
""As far as the future trend is concerned, it is quite obvious that it will continue to decline because the (producer price index) has apparently turned negative last month, and when PPI has turned negative, the profits of industrial enterprises will go down,"" said Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai, adding that the structure of corporate profitability will also start to change.
""Profits at mid- and downstream sectors may stabilize while the upstream sector will face immense pressure.""
Profits at chemical, coal mining and non-ferrous metal sectors all slowed significantly in December, the data showed.
For the full year, profits rose 10.3 percent to 6.64 trillion yuan in 2018, easing from 2017's robust pace of 21 percent. 
Upstream sectors such as oil extraction, coal and metal mining still commanded the lion's share of profit gains last year, but analysts say that as industrial prices slow further or even shrink, profitability will come under pressure. 
Tang said that if large-scale tax cuts promised by the government could be rolled out in time, however, it would help put a floor on declining industrial profits in the second half.
A survey from the state planner this month showed activity at 2,500 Chinese small- and mid-sized enterprises continued to contract in the fourth quarter last year despite a flurry of supportive government policies.
The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Index stood at 93 last quarter, below the 100-mark that separates growth from contraction, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.
Moody's said in a recent report the Chinese government's latest measures to support funding for private firms would be limited in effect, as credit would mostly flow to the fewer stronger privately-owned enterprises.
Monday's data showed industrial firms' liabilities rose 5.2 percent from a year earlier to 64.1 trillion yuan by end-2018, compared with a 5.8 percent rise as of end-November.
DEMAND REMAINS SOFT
Though traders are replenishing inventory ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in early February, demand remains weak.
Aggravating the slowdown, the government has also vowed it will not relent on enforcing anti-pollution controls, refusing to accept mounting economic pressure as excuses.
That raises uncertainty on the overall boost to the industrial sector from support measures policymakers have pledged so far.
Beijing has promised to increase spending on infrastructure projects this year and boost consumption in areas such as automobile and home appliances. 
The state-run enterprise China Railway is planning a record-high rail investment worth about 850 billion yuan in 2019, according to a Nikkei report. 
China's producer prices rose at their slowest pace in more than two years in December. New orders - an indicator of future activity - contracted for the first time in at least a year in December. 

Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms rose 12.6 percent in 2018 from a year earlier, slowing from a 16.1 percent increase in the January-November period.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale fell for the fifth consecutive month in January, a survey showed on Friday, signaling a downturn in Europe's largest economy where company executives have become pessimistic about future business for the first time since 2012.
The decline in morale stems from weaker demand for German goods and services in China, the euro zone and emerging markets, from transatlantic trade tensions and also growing uncertainty linked to Britain's looming departure from the European Union.
""Disquiet is growing among German businesses,"" said Clemens Fuest, president of the Munich-based Ifo economic institute. ""The German economy is experiencing a downturn.""
Ifo said its business climate index fell to 99.1, the lowest level since February 2016.
The German economy grew at a slower pace last year than in 2017 and sources told Reuters on Friday that the government had cut its growth forecast for this year to 1.0 percent from 1.8 percent.
""The increasing danger of a hard Brexit has proved to be a mood-killer,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger wrote in a note. ""This is mainly a reflection of falling expectations, which is not surprising given it is also the result of global trade disputes.""
Krueger added that the economy, which is expected to gain impetus from private consumption and increased state spending, was still a long way from experiencing a recession.
'ONE BLACK EYE'
But the downturn will continue in the coming months and any improvement will largely hinge on the outcome of Brexit and the easing of trade tensions between the United States and China, both key markets for German exporters.
The manufacturing sector started showing signs of weakness last year as the trade tensions between the United States and China escalated. The downward trend in the sector appears to be dragging down the whole economy.
The German economy has also suffered from homemade factors such as stricter emission standards that created bottlenecks in new car registrations and low rainfall that hampered fuel deliveries that rely on water channels in Germany.
ING Diba economist Carsten Brzeski said that an economic recovery in Germany largely depends on the outcome of Brexit and whether trade tensions dissipate.
""In this regard, Brexit is probably the single most threatening risk as a 'no-deal' Brexit would come at the most inconvenient time for the economy, namely exactly when it should be about to rebound,"" he added.
Britain, the world's fifth biggest economy and the second largest in the EU, is due to leave the EU on March 29 but its deeply divided parliament has yet to agree on the terms of its exit, raising the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit.

""All in all, we still think that the German economy could get away with one black eye. However, the shield that stronger domestic demand can offer against external risks will be put to a severe test in the coming months,"" said Brzeski.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Freight rates for dry-bulk and container ships, carriers of most of the world's raw materials and finished goods, have plunged over the last six months in the latest sign the global economy is slowing significantly. 
The Baltic Dry Index, measure of ship transport costs for materials like iron ore and coal, has fallen by 47 percent since mid-2018, when a trade dispute between the United States and China resulted in the world's two biggest economies slapping import tariffs on each other's goods. 
Dry-bulk commodities are taken as a leading economic indicator, because they are used in core industrial sectors like steelmaking and power generation, and analysts say the recent declines in activity point to a serious economic slowdown.
(graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2S7LJEz)
""Signs that the U.S. and China remain well apart in trade talks continued to weigh on sentiment in commodity markets,"" ANZ bank said in a note on Friday. 
This was after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the United States and China were ""miles and miles"" from resolving their issues. 
""The global economy and dry-bulk shipping market are showing us very real signs of distress,"" said Jeffrey Landsberg, managing director of commodity consultancy Commodore Research.
""While dry-bulk rates often face at least some pressure during the early stages of a year, the magnitude of the declines being seen lately have been very rare,"" he said. 
The Baltic index has lost a quarter of its value since the start of the year, and dry-bulk is not the only shipping market under pressure. 
The Harpex Shipping Index, which tracks container rates, has dropped by 30 percent since June 2018. 
As a measure of the demand for shipping manufactured goods from producers to consumers, container rates are also seen as a leading economic indicator. 
Their slump underscores weakening manufacturing data from Asia, Europe and North America. 
""Slowing global economic growth, the unresolved U.S.-China trade conflict, the U.S. government shutdown, and Brexit drama are all sources of uncertainty dragging at sentiment,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at futures brokerage FXTM. 
In the euro zone, a survey published on Thursday showed that business growth nearly stalled out at the start of 2019 as trade tensions and political woes meant incoming new work fell for the first time in over four years. 
Asian industrial powerhouse Japan posted similarly weak manufacturing data in its own survey this week. 
In China, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) this week warned the downward pressure on the economy would impact its job market as falling factory orders point to a drop in activity in coming months.

The United States has so far been in a better shape than other leading economies, but even there, manufacturing indices have been reflecting weakness since late 2018.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 12:58AM ET</span>","Japan revises up workers' compensation data, economy trend unchanged","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government on Friday revised up slightly its estimate on workers' compensation as measured in the national accounts, following recent revision to underreported wage data caused by more than a decade of faulty polling methods.
Friday's data revision came a day after the government said it had failed to properly compile 22 of its 56 key indicators. It followed the revelation that errors in the labor ministry's polling caused it to underreport wage data from 2004 to 2017.
The data errors are unlikely to change the pace of growth estimate, but they hurt the credibility of key government data used to gauge the success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policies.
""It is important for the government to exert efforts to prevent a recurrence and regain public trust in our statistics,"" Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
""I don't think our economic assessment will change because of the revision to wage data,"" while taking into account other data such as GDP, private consumption, capital spending, output, exports and imports and business sentiment, he said. 
Opposition lawmakers have described the data error as ""falsification"" aimed at justifying the premier's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies. They are expected to grill Abe's government in regular parliament sessions, to convene on Monday.
Erroneous data makes it difficult to assess whether Abe's policies are working, leaving policy makers blind-sided in their efforts to foster sustainable economic growth.
Japan's labor ministry said this month that discrepancies in its polling methods caused it to underreport monthly wage data from 2004 to 2017. The ministry has revised wage data from January 2012 to October 2018 to help rectify the errors.
The wage data revision led the Cabinet Office, which compiles GDP data, to revise up estimates on workers' compensation by 700 billion yen ($6.38 billion) in each of fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to 271.2 trillion yen and 276.3 trillion yen respectively. The annual pace of growth remained unchanged at 1.9 percent in fiscal 2017.

On a quarterly basis, the pace of year-on-year growth in workers' compensations was largely unchanged by the revision. Cabinet Office officials said they will later revise further past data going back to 2004.

Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, rose 1.1 percent in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
The rise in the core consumer price index for Japan's capital, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, compared with the median estimate of a 0.9 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists.
""Prices of electricity and gas boosted the Tokyo's core CPI but they are likely to start weakening from around spring reflecting falls in prices of natural gas and oil,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""We expect Tokyo's core CPI will hover around 1 percent in the next few months but after that, it will likely start slowing down,"" he said, adding the BOJ is expected to continue its stimulus policy to reach its price target.
The BOJ on Wednesday downgraded its forecast for core consumer inflation to 0.9 percent in the coming fiscal year from 1.4 percent projected last October, reflecting slumping oil prices.
The so-called core-core CPI, which strips away the effect of both energy and fresh food prices, rose 0.7 percent in January after a 0.6 percent gain in December. 
Tokyo's overall CPI rose 0.4 percent in January from a year earlier, the same pace as last month, data showed.
Japan's economy contracted in the third quarter last year and some economists suspect any rebound in October-December may be limited given global trade protectionism and cooling foreign demand. 
Analysts say recession risks to the Japanese economy have grown. 
However, despite rising risks, the BOJ this week kept its view that Japan's economy will continue to expand at a modest pace. 

Many BOJ policymakers are wary of adding even more stimulus, though external shocks could force the central bank to pull the trigger if the economy is at risk of a sharp deterioration.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell to more than a 49-year low last week, but the drop likely overstates the health of the labor market as claims for several states including California were estimated.
Still, labor market conditions remain strong, which for now should help to temper fears of a sharp slowdown in economic growth. Other data on Thursday showed a gauge of future U.S. economic activity fell in December.
The economy is facing several headwinds, including a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China and a month-long partial shutdown of the federal government, which are hurting consumer and business confidence. Higher interest rates, fading fiscal stimulus and cooling global economies are also seen crimping domestic growth. 
""If you're looking for good news on the economy, look no further than the labor market,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""Growth may be slowing, but the overall picture for workers and those seeking work remains quite positive.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the week ended Jan. 19, the lowest level since mid-November in 1969 when 197,000 applications were recorded, the Labor Department said.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for California, Kansas, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia and Hawaii were estimated last week because of Monday's Martin Luther King holiday. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,500 to 215,000 last week. 
About one-quarter of federal agencies have been shuttered since Dec. 22, impacting 800,000 government employees, with many working without pay and others furloughed. All workers will be paid retroactively when the shutdown ends.
But economists expect the longest shutdown in history will push the unemployment rate above 4.0 percent in January as the furloughed workers would be considered unemployed. 
The jobless rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.9 percent in December as strong labor market conditions attracted some unemployed people back into the labor force.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mixed after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Washington and Beijing were a long way from resolving their trade dispute. The dollar was stronger against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. 
DATA VACUUM
Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 24,000 to 1.71 million for the week ended Jan. 12. The so-called continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which January's unemployment rate will be calculated. 
Continuing claims rose 5,000 between the December and January survey periods. If there were no government shutdown, the modest gain between the survey weeks would suggest little change in the unemployment rate this month.
The number of federal workers filing for jobless benefits rose 14,965 to 25,419 in the week ending Jan. 12.
President Donald Trump is demanding $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Democratic lawmakers have refused to provide the funding for the wall.
The Commerce Department is one of the agencies whose funding has lapsed as a result of the deadlock in Washington. 
The publishing of data produced by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau has been suspended, leaving economists, investors, businesses and policymakers in the dark about the economy's health.
The limited data available from independent institutions, including the Federal Reserve suggests the economy slowed in the fourth quarter and continued to lose momentum in early 2019. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Conference Board said its leading indicator slipped 0.1 percent in December after gaining 0.2 percent in November. It said the moderation suggested ""that the economy could decelerate towards 2 percent growth by the end of 2019."" 
The report adds to recent data showing home resales plummeting in December and consumer sentiment tumbling to more than a two-year low in January. Some regional Fed manufacturing surveys have weakened in January. 
While a third report on Thursday from data firm IHS Markit showed factory activity firming in early January, growth in the services sector slowed. Economists estimate the government shutdown is subtracting at least two-tenths of a percentage point from quarterly GDP growth every week.
""Although three-quarters of the government is funded for the fiscal year, delays in government contracts for the remaining unfunded agencies could hurt private contractors,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Some Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), have slashed their first-quarter GDP growth forecasts to as low as a 2.0 percent annualized rate from as high as a 3.0 percent pace. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 2.8 percent rate. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the July-September quarter.

Last month, the ECB ended its four-year long €2.6 trillion ($2.96 trillion) bond purchase plan and reiterated that interest rates are likely to remain on hold at least through the end of summer.
But growth now appears weaker than thought just a few weeks ago. Data earlier in the day showed that business activity across the bloc barely expanded at the start of the year as a fall in new work pushed activity to a low not seen since the middle of 2013.
Similar surveys showed activity remained lackluster in Germany during January and contracted in France for a second month.
Economic weakness in the euro zone, coupled with growing concerns over the negative impact of the trade war between the U.S. and China, have caused economists to push back their expectations for the ECB's first interest rate hike of the cycle.
“While an outright recession will probably be avoided this year, a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the U.S. or further escalation of the (U.S.-China) trade war may be enough to cause a mild recession,” Andrew Kenningham, chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, warned.
In the midst of slowing growth, trade worries and lingering uncertainty regarding the U.K.’s separation from the European Union, economists don’t expect the ECB to raise its deposit rate until the fourth quarter. They think it will wait until early 2020 to raise its refinancing rate from zero.
“With the recent loss of growth momentum and increased downside risks to the growth outlook, stemming from trade, China and Brexit, the risk of the ECB sleepwalking into the next crisis has increased,” Carsten Brzeski, ING’s chief economist in Germany said. “For the time being, however, being a cool dude who is on high alert rather than panicking into impulsive action seems to be the right strategy.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity across the euro zone barely expanded at the start of the year as a fall in new work meant growth was at a low not seen since the middle of 2013, a survey showed on Thursday.
The findings will make disappointing reading for policymakers at the European Central Bank who have only just drawn a line under their more than 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program that was supposed to support growth.
They are predicted to leave interest rates on hold later on Thursday and expectations for when they will start tightening monetary policy were pushed out in a Reuters poll last week as the likelihood of a recession has risen.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index sank to 50.7, its weakest since July 2013, from a final December reading of 51.1, below even the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll where the median expectation was for a modest rise to 51.4.
That was only just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and IHS Markit said the PMI pointed to first quarter economic growth of fractionally below 0.1 percent. Last week's Reuters poll forecast 0.4 percent growth.
""It's a very disappointing start to the year. Lots of people had been looking for a rebound in the first quarter but that has not been the case,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""There has been a pull back in spending by businesses and households, reflecting concern about the general economic environment.""
An index measuring new business growth fell to 49.3 from 50.7, its first time below the breakeven mark since late-2014.
Earlier data from Germany showed activity remained lackluster in Europe's largest economy during January and contracted in France for a second month.
It has been a similarly disappointing month for the bloc's dominant service industry. Its flash PMI fell to 50.8 from December's final 51.2, a near 5-1/2 year low and missing expectations for 51.5.
This pushed firms to cut back on hiring. An employment PMI dropped to 51.9 from 53.6, a low not seen in nearly three years.
Adding to the gloomy picture, factories started the year with meager growth too. A manufacturing PMI sank to a more than four-year low in January of 50.5 from 51.4.
That was also below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted no change from December. An index measuring output fell to 50.4 from 51.0, its lowest since June 2013.
For a fifth month some of that output was generated by running down old orders. The backlogs of work index held firmly sub-50 at 48.5, albeit slightly higher than December's 48.0.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine economic growth slipped to the lowest annual pace in three years in 2018, though it edged up in the fourth quarter, giving the central bank little reason to resume hiking interest rates.
The Southeast Asian country posted full-year growth of 6.2 percent, below the government's downwardly revised target of 6.5-6.9 percent but still one of the fastest paces in Asia.
Annual growth in October-December was 6.1 percent compared with the previous quarter's revised 6.0 percent, but slightly weaker than the 6.2 percent projected in a Reuters poll. The economy grew 6.5 percent in the last three months of 2017.
With inflation expected to cool further this year, helped by easing global oil prices, the government is optimistic the economy will gather steam in the coming quarter. It has set a 7-8 percent growth goal.
But Capital Economics called the chance of sustained rebound in growth in 2019 ""slim"", partly because government infrastructure spending is set to increase at a slower pace. 
Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said household consumption should recover this year as inflationary pressures subside amid a subdued outlook on international oil prices and a reduction in local retail prices of rice.
However, he flagged concern about the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute on the global economy.
""We continue to be on the lookout for downside risks such as U.S.-China trade dispute dampening global demand with higher tariffs and protectionist policies stifling investment,"" he told a media briefing.
""Other external downside risks are tighter financing conditions in emerging markets due to the strengthening of the US dollar and rising risk premiums.""
In December, the central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged to let five straight hikes, totaling 175 basis points, work their way into the economy. Some analysts believe that marked the end of its tightening cycle.
The annual inflation peaked at 6.7 percent, a near decade high, in September and October, before slowing to 5.1 percent in December. Full-year 2018 average inflation rate was 5.2 percent, way above the central bank's 2-4 percent target.

Pernia said the government also remains vigilant of inflation risks.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>","Australia employment stays solid, jobless rate at six-and-a-half-year lows","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment jumped again in December and the jobless rate surprisingly fell, a generally upbeat report that should comfort the central bank as the labor market remains one of the strongest parts of the economy.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Thursday showed a net 21,600 new jobs were created in December, down from an upwardly revised 39,000 the month before but surpassing market forecasts of a 16,500 increase.
The overall trend in Australia's labor market has been robust over the past couple of years with annual job growth of 2.2 percent, faster than the 1.6 percent rise in population. Full-time positions expanded by almost 2 percent in 2018.
Thursday's data will be welcomed by policymakers who are counting on labor market strength for a long-awaited pick up in wage growth and inflation in the face of a downturn in the property market.
Some details in the report, however, were not quite as impressive, with full-time positions that tend to offer higher wages and greater security declining by 3,000, adding to falls in November.
That means the increase in employment in December was entirely led by part-time work.
The participation rate eased to 65.6 percent in December, helping bring down the unemployment rate to 5.0 percent - an equal 6-1/2 year low touched in September and October. 
The underemployment rate fell, too, to 8.4 percent but stayed above its historical average, pointing to still-high spare capacity in the labor market.
""High levels of slack continue to weigh on wage growth, despite a decline in the unemployment rate,"" said Callam Pickering, APAC economist for global job site Indeed.
""Softer economic conditions, including falling property prices, suggest that employment growth will ease somewhat in 2019."" 
Australia's once-booming property market is in a sharp downturn with prices in Sydney falling at the fastest pace in two decades. Many economists expect home values to fall further this year.
Yet, leading indicators of labor demand still point to further employment growth in Australia in a positive sign for household spending. An index of vacancies released by the department of jobs and small business on Wednesday showed there were 185,547 skilled job vacancies in December, the highest in 6-1/2 years. 
That should give the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) confidence that the A$1.8 trillion economy is on the right track. The RBA has held the cash rate at a record low 1.50 percent for almost 2-1/2 years now while repeatedly signaling the next move would be an increase.
With the latest data unlikely to budge the RBA from this neutral stance, the local dollar  rose slightly to $0.7159 from $0.7146 before the job report.
All eyes will now be on fourth-quarter inflation report due next week with economists generally expecting growth in prices to slow, an outcome that could add to the case for a rate cut. 

Interest rate futures <0#YIB:> are now pricing in an almost 60 percent chance of a cut by December, a sharp turnaround from expectations of a hike just a couple of months back.

The companies signed up for $12.7 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $12.8 billion a year earlier. However, borrowings rose 59 percent from November, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA) said.
""December new business volume capped off a very good year for the equipment leasing and finance industry. Solid demand, an abundant supply of funding in the credit markets, and quality portfolios all contributed to an extremely healthy equipment finance sector in 2018,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
According to him, most economists expect a lower-growth scenario in 2019, as a result of trade policy frictions, rising interest rates, and the current government shutdown.
""Whether these and other potential headwinds act as a brake on continued growth in the equipment finance sector over the next 12 months remains to be seen,"" Petta said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals were 77.9 percent in December, up from 77.2 percent in November.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT), the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for January is 53.4, down from the December index of 55.5. 

A reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is set to cut its inflation forecasts and maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy on Wednesday, as pressure on the economy mounts in the face of slowing global demand, dealing another blow to its years-long efforts to foster durable growth. 
The deteriorating global outlook also means the BOJ is some way off from exiting a sweeping stimulus program begun in 2013, which policymakers have acknowledged will do more harm than good the longer it is retained.
Sources have told Reuters the central bank will maintain its view that Japan's economy, the world's third largest, will continue to expand at a modest pace. Yet, the rising pressure on global growth from a trade war between the United States and China - Japan's biggest trading partners - has many analysts wary about the outlook.
A Reuters poll of economists showed those external factors have increased the chances of Japan sliding into a recession this coming fiscal year starting in April, making it ever so harder for the BOJ to reach its 2 percent inflation target. 
Moreover, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs amid the trade tensions. 
""On top of a planned sales tax hike in October, risks to overseas economies are heightening and stock prices remain volatile. Under such circumstances, the BOJ sees no merit in suggesting policy normalization,"" said Naomi Muguruma, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Governor (Haruhiko) Kuroda will likely vow to keep current easing while analyzing costs and effects of such policy. He may even voice readiness for further easing. He needs to wait until global uncertainties fade before laying the ground for policy normalization.""
At its policy-setting meeting ending on Wednesday, the BOJ is widely expected to keep its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero percent.
With stubbornly weak inflation forcing it to retain its massive stimulus longer than expected, the BOJ took steps in July to make some changes to its policy framework, such as allowing bond yields to move more flexibly around its target.
On Wednesday, the BOJ's nine-member board will issue a quarterly report analyzing Japan's economy including fresh growth and inflation projections through the fiscal year ending in March 2021.
The central bank is likely to largely keep its economic growth projections, with lower energy costs and government spending set to ease the pain of the planned tax hike in October, the sources said.
LOWER INFLATION FORECAST
The BOJ is expected to cut its forecast for core consumer inflation to around 1 percent in the fiscal year beginning in April from 1.4 percent, reflecting slumping oil prices and the potential fallout from slowing global growth, the sources said. It would be the fourth downward revision by the central bank to its inflation forecast for fiscal 2019 since it was first estimated in April 2017.
That would still beat a 0.7 percent forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. 
The central bank will also likely trim core consumer inflation slightly from 1.5 percent, seen under the current forecasts made in October, in the following financial year.
Many economists in the poll say the BOJ's next move is to start normalizing policy, with its steps likely including expanding its 10-year bond yield fluctuation from 0.2 percent and raising the 10-year yield target from around zero percent.
A majority expect that would happen in 2020 or later.
As part of efforts to prevent financial institutions from sitting on their huge pile of cash, the central bank will extend the March deadline for a lending scheme aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost loans, the sources said.
The BOJ's radical stimulus program has had some unintended consequences, as years of low rates hurt financial institutions' profits. 

Many BOJ policymakers are wary of ramping up stimulus, though external shocks or a sudden spike in the yen could force the central bank to do just that if the economy is at risk of sliding into recession.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales hit three-year low, prices rise slowly","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales tumbled to their lowest level in three years in December and house price increases slowed sharply, suggesting a further loss of momentum in the housing market.
The weak report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) on Tuesday was the latest indication of slowing economic growth. A survey last Friday showed consumer sentiment dropped in January to its lowest level since President Donald Trump was elected more than two years ago.
Existing home sales were now the weakest since Trump was elected, said MUFG Chief Economist Chris Rupkey, ""signaling the initial confidence boost from the new ideas and new legislation is falling flat."" 
The NAR said existing home sales declined 6.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.99 million units last month. That was the lowest level since November 2015.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales falling 1.0 percent to a rate of 5.25 million units in December. Existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, plunged 10.3 percent from a year ago. 
For all of 2018, sales fell 3.1 percent to 5.34 million units, the weakest since 2015. 
The housing market has been stymied by higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventory and more expensive homes. 
But there are glimmers of hope. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to a four-month low, with much of the moderation occurring in the second half of December, and house price inflation is slowing. The median existing house price increased 2.9 percent from a year ago to $253,600 in December. That was the smallest increase since February 2012.
Wage growth topped 3.2 percent in December, outpacing house price gains for the first time since February 2012, according to the NAR. While economists expect affordability to improve, they also caution that changes to the tax code in December 2017, which limited deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes, had reduced the appeal of homeownership.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid fears of slowing global economic growth after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its outlook. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BROAD WEAKNESS
A survey last week showed a rebound in homebuilders' confidence in January amid hope that the moderation in mortgage rates ""will help the housing market continue to grow at a modest clip as we enter the new year.""
A month-long partial shutdown of the federal government, which has delayed data from the Commerce Department is, however, obscuring the economic picture.
The shutdown started on Dec. 22 as Trump demanded that Congress give him $5.7 billion this year to help build a wall on the country's border with Mexico. 
It has affected the Commerce Department, leading to the suspension of the publication of data compiled by its Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau, including new home sales, housing starts and building permits.
Data released before the shutdown had pointed to persistent weakness in the housing market, with economists estimating that housing would again be a drag on gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Residential construction has subtracted from GDP growth since the first quarter of 2018.
Economists estimate that the impasse over the border wall was cutting off at least two-tenths of a percentage point from quarterly GDP growth a week. The Realtors group said the longest government shutdown in the country's history had so far not had an impact on home sales, but warned this could change.
Last month, existing home sales fell in all four regions. There were 1.55 million previously owned homes on the market in December, down from 1.74 million in November, but up from 1.46 million a year ago.
At December's sales pace, it would take 3.7 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.9 in November and up from 3.2 a year ago. A six-to-seven-months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 46 days in December, up from 42 days in November and 40 days a year ago. Thirty-nine percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month.
The share of first-time buyers fell to 32 percent last month from 33 percent in November. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.

""Going forward, we expect softer home prices to support existing home sales, but not by enough to offset the downtrend,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York. ""The only sustainable and viable solution in our view is more construction, especially of lower-priced homes.""

316,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>",German investor morale brightens unexpectedly in January,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors improved for the third consecutive month in January, a survey unexpectedly showed on Tuesday, suggesting that the growth prospects of Europe's largest economy are slowly brightening despite numerous risks from abroad.
Weaker growth in emerging markets, trade disputes driven by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies and the possibility that Britain will leave the European Union without a deal in March are putting the brakes on a nine-year expansion.
The ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors rose to -15.0 from -17.5 in December. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast of -18.4.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions fell to 27.6 from 45.3 in the previous month. The Reuters forecast was 43.5.
""It is remarkable that the ZEW Economic Sentiment for Germany has not deteriorated further given the large number of global economic risks,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said.
Wambach said that investors had already considerably lowered their expectations for economic growth in the past months.
""New, potentially negative factors such as the rejection of the Brexit deal by the British House of Commons and the relatively weak growth in China in the last quarter of 2018 have thus already been anticipated,"" he added.
The German economy grew by 1.5 percent in 2018, the weakest rate in five years and markedly slower than the previous year, data showed last week, as exporters are hit by U.S. trade disputes and the car industry struggles to adjust to stricter pollution standards.

The government will update its 2019 economic growth forecast next week. In October, the economy ministry had predicted gross domestic product would expand by 1.8 percent this year. The Ifo institute last month reduced its forecast to 1.1 percent.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment rose to -15.0 points this month from a reading of -17.5 in December.
Analysts had expected the index to fall to -18.4 points.
However, the Current Conditions Index dropped to 27.6 from 45.3, much worse than expectations for a reading of 43.5.
On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.
Recent data showed that the German economy only narrowly avoided slipping into recession at the end of last year, amid global trade conflicts, messy Brexit negotiations and the after-effects of the diesel emissions scandal on its auto sector.

318,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 04:42AM ET</span>",U.K. Unemployment Rate Dips to 4.0%,"Investing.com - A solid U.K. jobs report released Tuesday strengthened the case a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of England, as both employment and earnings growth came in a little above expectations.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.0% in November, beating expectations for it to hold steady at 4.1%.
The number of people in employment in the U.K. rose 141,000 in the three months to November, hitting a record high of 32.54 million. Economists had expected an increase of just 88,000.
Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by an annual 3.3% in the three months to November, matching consensus for it to hold steady at the prior reading.
Including bonuses, pay growth rose by an annual 3.4%, above expectations for no change from October’s 3.3% increase. That was the fastest pace since July 2008.
The Bank of England has pointed to rising wages and their upward pressure on consumer price inflation as part of their argument for the need for gradual rate hikes.
Markets expect one increase this year, but escalating uncertainty with regard to the outcome of Brexit negotiations with the European Union has kept the BoE on hold as it fears the possibility that an abrupt exit with no deal could hit both economic growth and affect inflation."
319,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",UK pay growth hits fresh 10-year high as employment soars,"LONDON, (Reuters) - British workers' pay growth hit a new 10-year high and employment grew by much more than expected in the three months to the end of November, as the labor market remained robust despite other signs of an economic slowdown ahead of Brexit.
Average weekly earnings, including bonuses, rose by 3.4 percent on the year, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday, the biggest rise since mid-2008 and compared with a median forecast of 3.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by an annual 3.3 percent in the three months to November. Adjusted for inflation, total pay rose at the fastest pace for two years.
Employment increased by the largest amount since the three months to April, although it is unclear whether businesses will maintain hiring at these levels as uncertainty around Brexit mounts.
British Prime Minister Theresa May sought to break a parliamentary deadlock over Brexit on Monday by proposing to seek further concessions from the European Union on a plan to prevent customs checks on the Irish border.
With little time left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29, there is no agreement in London on how it should leave the world’s biggest trading bloc, and a growing chance of a dramatic ‘no-deal’ exit with no provisions to soften the economic shock.
Businesses are cutting investment before Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union in late March, leaving the overall economy growing at a snail's pace.
Still, the Bank of England has said it will need to raise interest rates gradually to offset inflation pressures from the labor market.
With unemployment at close to its lowest level since the 1970s -- 4.0 percent in the three months to November -- employers have begun raising pay for staff more quickly.
However, the pace of wage rises remains slower than the 4 percent increases seen before the financial crisis.
The number of people in work rose by 141,000 in the three months to November, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to a rise of 85,000.

Separate figures from the ONS showed British government borrowing came in higher than expected in December at 2.976 billion pounds, compared with forecasts for borrowing of 1.9 billion pounds, largely reflecting higher European Union budget contributions.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 12:15AM ET</span>","China's fourth quarter GDP growth dented by services, agriculture despite construction rebound","BEIJING (Reuters) - Weakness in the service and farm sectors slowed China's economic growth in the fourth quarter, despite a strong pickup in construction activity, official data showed on Tuesday.
Services grew 7.4 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 7.9 percent in the third quarter, while growth in agriculture slowed to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. 
The sector-by-sector breakdown follows release of headline GDP figures on Monday that showed China's economy in the last quarter expanded at its slowest rate since the global financial crisis due to faltering domestic demand and an ongoing trade war with the United States.
The services sector accounted for almost half of gross domestic product in the quarter by value as China continued to transition toward a service-oriented economy, while agriculture contributed about 10 percent, according to Reuters' calculations based on the latest data. 
Services suffered a broad-based slackening from real estate to tech, as these industries braced for more cautious investor lending and softer consumer demand.
Real estate growth slowed to 2 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter from 4.1 percent a quarter earlier, as government tightening measures to curb speculation and skyrocketing prices subdued overall demand. The sector contributed 6.4 percent to GDP in the quarter.
The retail and wholesale sector slowed to 5.5 percent from 6.2 percent as consumption of physical goods lost momentum. Auto sales in the world's biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s. 
Though retail sales growth picked up marginally in December to 8.2 percent, the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years.
Having been a stellar performer benefiting from supportive policies, the tech sector still grew at double-digit rate but growth slowed to 29.1 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 32.8 percent in the third. It accounted for about 3 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter.
Finance was one of the few bright spots in the service sector thanks to recent government stimulus measures to keep liquidity ample. 
Construction enjoyed a strong recovery thanks to support for infrastructure projects, as the government frontloaded local government bond issuance to support their financing.
The sector - accounting for 8 percent of the economy - grew 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the previous quarter's 2.5 percent growth.

321,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 11:50PM ET</span>",China Economy to Stabilize Without Aggressive Stimulus: Goldman,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s more than $13 trillion economy will likely stabilize in the second half of 2019 without the need for aggressive stimulus, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Chief Economist Jan Hatzius.
""We don’t think it’s going to be an aggressive amount of stimulus,"" Hatzius told Bloomberg Television’s Rishaad Salamat in an interview in Hong Kong. ""But we would expect some stabilization as we move through 2019 in the Chinese economy.""
The pace of expansion in the world’s second largest economy slowed to 6.4 percent during the fourth quarter, the softest since 2009. For the full year, the economy expanded 6.6 percent, the slowest pace since 1990, stoking expectations for additional stimulus from the government after a series of piecemeal measures ranging from tax cuts to steps to boost lending.
While China is locked in a bruising trade war with the U.S., Hatzius pinned much of the slowdown on the government’s policy push to curb the overall level of debt in the economy.
""The most important driver really has been the credit deceleration and the concerns about financial imbalances on the part of the policy makers that has led them to pursue stricter policies,"" he said. ""To us, that is the main swing factor in a negative direction in 2018, maybe in a slightly more positive direction in 2019.""
But he also flagged the risk to sentiment and investment from the trade war and cautioned that negotiations between the U.S. and China could yet fail to resolve their differences.
Global Outlook
For his global outlook, the Goldman economist said he sees little need for major changes to global forecasts even as the International Monetary Fund Monday cut its forecast for the world economy, predicting it will grow at the weakest pace in three years in 2019.
He added that the slowdown in the U.S. is necessary to help steer the economy away from a hard landing. Which means the Federal Reserve is likely on hold, for now.
""They have appropriately moved to a pause,"" he said, adding that the next few months will feature ""a very neutral environment and very neutral language.""
On Brexit, Hatzius’s base case remains for the British government and European Union to eventually agree on a withdrawal agreement.
""There is some risk of a hard Brexit, but we would really only put that at 10 percent,"" he said.

Growth in the retail and wholesale sectors slowed to 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, down from 7.2 percent at the end of 2017. Real-estate growth slid to 2 percent in the quarter, compared with the 5.9 percent pace a year earlier. Together, they make up almost a third of the services sector.
Those slowdowns are much sharper than the national economy -- which just edged slower to 6.4 percent from 6.5 percent. The services sector, which accounted for more than half of national output last year, suffered from deteriorating consumer confidence amid a crackdown on borrowing and the trade war with the U.S.
The output of technology services increased 29.1 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, versus 32.8 percent in the previous three-month through September, according to the National Statistics Bureau on Tuesday.
The technology sector was already showing signs of stress after years of growth, with hiring advertisements declining in the second half of last year. Output in the the leading technology hub of Shenzhen slowed to 7.5 percent last year, from 8.8 percent in 2017.

323,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",U.N. sees global economy growing 3 percent in 2019 but beset by risk,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations expects the global economy to grow 3.0 percent this year and in 2020, slightly below a 3.1 percent expansion in 2018, it said on Monday.
But urgent and concrete policy action is needed to put the world on track to meet the U.N.'s goals for eradicating poverty by 2030, it said in its annual economic forecast, the ""World Economic Situation and Prospects"".
""There are plenty of yellow lights flashing and some of those yellow lights are almost certainly likely to turn red over the coming year, with very unpredictable consequences,"" said Richard Kozul-Wright, head of globalization and development strategies at the U.N. economic agency UNCTAD.
""Growth is fragile, huge uncertainties remain, risks are looming. We have not broken away from the legacy of the financial crisis of 2008-2009. We are still in a new abnormal.""
The report said employment was rising but job quality remained low and far greater economic growth was needed in Africa to get people out of poverty.
More than 700 million people live below the extreme poverty line, defined as $1.90 per day in 2011 purchasing power parity, and half of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.
""In Africa, economic growth needs to rise to double-digit levels to reach poverty reduction targets, well beyond growth rates recorded over the last 50 years,"" the report said. 
The global short-term picture appeared ""reasonably comfortable"", Kozul-Wright said, but many risks had become much more worrying in the past few months, including the end of the ""sugar rush"" given to the U.S. economy by President Donald Trump's tax cuts.
There were risks associated with slowing growth in Germany and China, the Italian banking system, Britain's exit from the European Union, and the fact that the world economy was still overly burdened with debt a decade after the financial crisis. 

""There are very serious threats to economic growth along several fronts - trade, debt, geopolitical, climatic... against a backdrop of deficient leadership at the international level in which trust in traditional institutions, both domestic and international, is draining very quickly,"" Kozul-Wright said.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>",Brexit not to blame for shrinking UK chocolate bars - ONS,"LONDON (Reuters) - The sizes of chocolate bars, rolls of toilet paper and boxes of breakfast cereal on sale in Britain have all been shrinking, but this was just as big a problem before the country voted to leave the European Union as after, statisticians said on Monday.
Between September, 2015 and June, 2017 about 206 products used to calculate British inflation shrank in size, while only 79 increased, the Office for National Statistics said.
Some Britons have blamed the fall in the pound and an increased cost in imports after June 2016's Brexit referendum for reduced product sizes, most obviously when the Toblerone bar lost several of its chocolate peaks in November, 2016.
But the ONS said there was no evidence Brexit was to blame for so-called ""shrinkflation"".
""There was no trend in the frequency of size changes over this period, which included the EU referendum,"" the statistics agency concluded, echoing its earlier research into the topic.
Toblerone's makers always denied Brexit was the reason for the change, and the bar returned to its traditional shape last July.
Food products changed in size most often, especially cereals, meat and confectionery -- but toilet rolls, nappies, tissues and washing-up liquid were affected too.
Retailers rarely adjusted prices immediately after a product's change in size, so the shrinking size of some products will have added to British consumer price inflation, which hit a five-year high of 3.1 percent in November, 2017.
However, the ONS said it estimated the effect was small as only 1.0-2.1 percent of products used to calculate inflation shrank in size, while 0.3-0.7 percent increased.
British manufacturers have been under pressure from public health authorities to reduce the calories and sugar in their products for a number of years. 

Confectioners agreed in 2014 to reduce the size of single-serve chocolate bars so they contained no more than 250 calories. A new sugar tax last year led to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and other soft drinks being sold in smaller bottles.

IHS Markit said its monthly Household Finances Index picked up to a three-month high in January, on the back of households' perception that their living costs were rising at the slowest rate since October 2016.
The official measure of consumer price inflation dropped to its lowest in nearly two years in December at 2.1 percent.
But households' expectations for their finances over the year to come, when Britain is due to leave the European Union, remained close to their lowest level since early 2014. 
""Political deadlock over Brexit merely adds extra uncertainty to an already unfavorable financial environment for UK households,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a historic parliamentary defeat over her Brexit plans last week, raising the prospect that Britain could leave the European Union on March 29 with no transition agreement to ensure trade continues smoothly.
Businesses have put investment on hold because of Brexit, and activity slowed towards the end of 2018.
""Job security perceptions deteriorated to a near one-year low, while there was no bounce-back from the stark drop in house price expectations seen in December,"" Hayes said.
Figures from property website Rightmove earlier on Monday showed the weakest start to the year since 2012 for property asking prices.
However, most of the 1,500 adults surveyed by polling company Ipsos MORI for IHS Markit still expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the first half of 2019, while 73 percent expect an increase before the end of the year.

Economists polled previously by Reuters on average expect the BoE to raise rates once or twice in 2019, assuming Brexit proceeds smoothly.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades and pressuring Beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown.
Growing signs of weakness in China -- which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years -- are fueling anxiety about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to big carmakers.
Policymakers have pledged more support this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses, but have ruled out a ""flood"" of stimulus like that which Beijing has relied on in the past, which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt.
""The government has means to support the economy. They can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks' reserve requirement ratio. So we don't need to worry about capital spending,"" said Naoto Saito, chief researcher at Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo.
""But the problem lies in consumption. As the U.S. and China clash on many fronts, consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt. Until now, solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future.""
Fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) grew at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis, easing to 6.4 percent on-year as expected from 6.5 percent in the third quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday.
That pulled full-year growth down to 6.6 percent, the slowest annual pace since 1990. GDP in 2017 grew a revised 6.8 percent.
With support measures expected to take some time to kick in, most analysts believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better, and see a further slowing to 6.3 percent this year.
Some China watchers believe actual growth is already weaker than official data suggest.
UNCERTAINTIES APLENTY
Despite a raft of policy easing steps so far, December data released along with GDP showed continued weakness across broad areas of the economy at the end of last year.
Factory output picked up unexpectedly to 5.7 percent from 5.4 percent, but it was one of the few bright spots, along with a stronger services sector.
While regulators have been fast-tracking construction projects, most of the gain appeared due to higher mining and oil production. Reuters calculations showed average daily steel output hit its lowest level since March as producers cut output amid shrinking profit margins.
Despite the slowing economy, Chinese officials also pledged to continue with a crackdown on air pollution that has weighed on the industrial sector. 
Other data on Monday showed investment and retail sales continued to languish, while the jobless rate edged higher.
Fixed-asset investment rose 5.9 percent in 2018, the slowest in at least 22 years, as a regulatory crackdown on riskier financing and debt weighed on local government spending early in the year.
Property investment is also looking wobbly, with analysts waiting to see if Beijing will risk loosening restrictions on home buyers that have kept a potential housing bubble in check. 
Chinese consumers are clearly feeling the pressure.
Though retail sales growth picked up marginally in December to 8.2 percent, the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years. Auto sales in the world's biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s.
Officials recently pledged to boost consumer demand for big-ticket items from cars to appliances. But gains in disposable income are slowing, while household debt is on the rise.
Other data in recent weeks showed exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month, while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding.
Some factories in Guangdong - China's export hub - have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long Lunar New Year holiday as new business dries up. 
TRADE PRESSURES
Even if China and the United States agree on a trade deal in current talks, which would be a tall order, analysts said it would be no panacea for China or its exporters.
Demand is weakening globally, not just in the United States. Net exports actually dragged on China's growth by 8.6 percent last year, Reuters calculations based on official data showed.
Trade negotiators are facing an early March deadline and Washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of agreement.
White House officials have given markedly different views on progress so far. China's Vice Premier and lead negotiator Liu He is due to visit Washington for the next round of talks at the end of the month. 
MORE STIMULUS
To free up more funds for lending, particularly to vulnerable smaller firms, the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves (RRR) five times over the past year, and guided borrowing costs lower.
Further RRR reductions are expected in coming quarters, but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates yet, as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilize activity.
More forceful easing could also pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels, with money going into less efficient or speculative investments as it often has in the past. 
The government may unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in March, including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects.
Some analysts believe it could deliver 2 trillion yuan ($295.13 billion) worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year, and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects.
China has ample room for policy adjustments, statistics bureau chief Ning Jizhe said on Monday.
Still, some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer.

Gross domestic product rose 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching economists’ estimates, and compared with 6.5 percent in the previous three-month period. In December, gauges of consumption and factory output accelerated, while investment held up.
The world’s second-largest economy is on a long-term slowing trajectory as it shifts from the investment-led model of the past while carrying a heavy debt load. The government’s control of that process is being tested by the standoff with U.S. President Donald Trump over trade at a time when the global expansion is already looking shakier.
Authorities have used an array of targeted and limited stimulus measures to try and revive optimism without resorting to massive stimulus, as they have in past downturns.
The trade conflict, debt curbs, slumping consumer confidence as well as a lack of “animal spirits” are all major headwinds the economy is facing this year, according to Stephen Chang, portfolio manager for Asia at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Hong Kong. ""While the government is putting policy responses in place, we anticipate that these will need to be ramped up over the course of the year,"" Chang wrote in a note ahead of the data.
For the full year, the economy expanded 6.6 percent, in line with estimates. Although it has moderated significantly from the years of double-digit growth, China is still one of the fastest growing large economies and its larger size now means it remains the world’s growth engine.
The statistics office also said Monday:
So far, the government and central bank have tried to stimulate the economy without resorting to a massive credit flood and infrastructure binge like in 2009. The People’s Bank of China has been quietly guiding interbank borrowing costs down without actually cutting official interest rates, and the fiscal authorities have pressed on with tax cuts and expedited government bond sales, among other policies.
With President Xi Jinping’s top economic aide Liu He heading to the U.S. this month, the challenging economic background adds pressure to reach a deal on trade.
Due to the massive size of its market, China’s slowdown is also bringing pain to companies and industries worldwide. Auto sales in the most populous nation dropped for the first time in three decades last year, hurting prospects of not only local manufacturers but also of companies such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp.
Meantime, a downturn in iPhone sales in China has hurt Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s share price this month and raised question marks over whether the consumer can keep cushioning the economy’s rebalancing away from the old smokestack industries.
If the slowdown deepens, authorities may resort to more aggressive easing such as relaxing property purchasing curbs in the biggest cities, economists have speculated.

Rightmove's data suggested a continuation of the weakness in British house prices that intensified in 2018, especially in and around London where fears of economic damage from Brexit made buyers loath to pay more for already-expensive homes.
""Given the current market backdrop and ongoing political turmoil, it's not surprising that the more challenging conditions in London and nearby regions mean they have had a slower start to the year,"" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said.
Last week the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its members had the most negative outlook for house sales over the coming three months since its records began in 1999.
Asking prices on Rightmove, which advertises property for 90 percent of British estate agents, were 0.4 percent higher in the first two weeks of January than a year earlier. 
Prices were also 0.4 percent up on December levels, the weakest December to January increase since 2012.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but Prime Minister Theresa May's record parliamentary defeat over her plans last week has thrown into doubt the terms, timing and even the certainty of Brexit.
Rightmove said potential buyers were tuning out the political noise and the number of people viewing property on its website in the first half of January was up 5 percent from 2018.

""Mass-market home-movers have a track-record of ignoring the politics and continuing to satisfy their housing needs, and as long as these fundamentals remain in place through this period of uncertainty, the market will keep moving,"" Shipside said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers dropped for a third straight month in January to a two-year low, a Reuters monthly poll showed, as worries over the health of the global economy and trade tensions take a toll on the corporate sector.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found service-sector sentiment held steady, suggesting that domestic demand may help offset rising headwinds from abroad.
But sentiment at both manufacturers and the service sector was seen deteriorating further in the coming three months, boding ill for the central bank's tankan survey due next on April 1.
The monthly poll results come as the central bank is set to debate downside risks to the economy and the price outlook. Weakening inflation and slowing external demand mean the BOJ is in no position to normalize monetary policy, while some investors are speculating further easing down the road.
In the Reuters poll of 480 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 480 firms responded on condition of anonymity, exporters complained about lack of demand in China and the United States and voiced concerns about the trade war between Japan's two major trading partners.
""Global demand is becoming markedly sluggish,"" a manager at a transport equipment maker wrote in the survey. ""The United States has not been performing well since the start of this fiscal year, but other countries like China, India and Mexico are slowing down as well in the latter half.""
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 18, down five points from the previous month, dragged down by declines in sectors such as steel and automobiles, according to the survey conducted Jan. 7-16.
The index is expected to fall further to 17 in April.
Underpinned by retailers, the service-sector index held steady at 31 in January reflecting firmness in private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy.
The service-sector index was seen slipping to 27 in April.
The BOJ's tankan last month showed business confidence held steady from three months ago, but companies expect conditions to worsen three months ahead, a sign that the Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing global demand could chill corporate activity.
Japan's economy shrank an annualized 2.5 percent in the third quarter, suffering its worst slump in more than four years, as a string of natural disasters cooled consumer sentiment and disrupted factory output.
Many analysts expect growth to have rebounded in the current quarter, but global trade friction and a slowdown in China have raised risks to Japan's export-driven economy.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 02:46PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer sentiment at two-year low, manufacturing rebounds","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment tumbled in early January to its lowest level since President Donald Trump was elected more than two years ago as an ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government and financial market volatility stoked fears of a sharp deceleration in economic growth.
The drop in confidence reported by the University of Michigan on Friday is the clearest sign yet that the impasse in Washington over Trump's demands for $5.7 billion to help build a wall on the United States' border with Mexico was negatively impacting the economy. Trump has touted high consumer confidence as an indication of the good job he is doing on the economy.
While consumer sentiment remains relatively high, the gathering dark clouds over the economy could make households more cautious about spending, leading to slower growth. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
""This report on consumer sentiment is the first concrete evidence that the economy is going to fall and fall hard if Washington does not end the shutdown,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""It is going to be hard to see real GDP growth of more than 1 to 1-1/2 percent in the first quarter if the consumer goes on a buying strike.""
The longest government shutdown in the history of the United States has left some 800,000 government workers without a paycheck. Private contractors working for many government agencies are also without wages. 
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell 7.7 percent to a reading of 90.7 this month, the lowest reading since October 2016 and the steepest drop since September 2015. Economists had forecast a reading of a 97.0.
The survey's measure of current economic conditions decreased to 110.0 from a reading of 116.1 in December. Its measure of consumer expectations tumbled to a reading of 78.3, the lowest since October 2016, from 87.0 in late December.The University of Michigan attributed the decline in sentiment to ""a host of issues including the partial government shutdown, the impact of tariffs, instabilities in financial markets, the global slowdown, and the lack of clarity about monetary policies."" 
It said that half of the survey's respondents ""believed that these events would have a negative impact on Trump's ability to focus on economic growth.""
Economists estimate the partial shutdown of the government, which started on Dec. 22, is subtracting as much as two-tenths of a percentage point from quarterly GDP growth every week.
Other surveys have also shown an ebb in business sentiment.
""Sentiment among both households and businesses has been coming off the sugar highs, which were caused by tax cut hopes at the beginning of the Trump presidency,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit in New York.
U.S. financial markets shrugged off the fall in sentiment, with investors focusing on another report on Friday showing manufacturing output surged by the most in 10 months in December and on hopes for progress in the U.S-China trade row. 
Stocks on Wall Street rallied, setting the three main indexes on track for their fourth week of gains. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
FACTORY ACTIVITY ACCELERATES
The broad-based jump in manufacturing output in December reported by the Federal Reserve could allay fears of a sharp slowdown in factory activity. 
Manufacturing activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is slowing as some of the boost to capital spending from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. In addition, a strong dollar and cooling growth in Europe and China are hurting exports. Lower oil prices are also slowing purchases of equipment for oil and gas well drilling.
Production at factories increased at a 2.3 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 3.7 percent pace in the July-September period. It increased 2.4 percent in 2018, the largest gain since 2012, after advancing 1.2 percent in 2017.
""While the manufacturing strength in December is a favorable signal for the economy, we should keep in mind that it came after soft results in earlier months,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""A broad range of manufacturing surveys also have been weakening lately, so the strength in the manufacturing output in December may prove to be short-lived.""
Last month, motor vehicle production surged 4.7 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in November. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing advanced a solid 0.8 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in November.

December's 1.1 percent surge in manufacturing output, together with a rise in mining production, offset a weather-related drop in utilities, leading to a 0.3 percent increase in industrial production. Industrial output rose 0.4 percent in November. It increased at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter after notching a 4.7 percent gain in the third quarter.

332,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 10:08AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Sentiment Falls to Lowest Level During Trump Presidency,"Investing.com - U.S. consumer optimism waned in January, hitting its lowest level since President Donald Trump was elected, as a host of factors, including the partial government shutdown, weighed on sentiment.
The preliminary publication of the data for January from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment decreased to 90.7 from 98.3 a month earlier.
Economists had forecast a drop to 97.
“The decline was primarily focused on prospects for the domestic economy, with the year-ahead outlook for the national economy judged the worst since mid-2014,” the surveyor’s chief economist Richard Curtin said.
“The loss was due to a host of issues including the partial government shutdown, the impact of tariffs, instabilities in financial markets, the global slowdown, and the lack of clarity about monetary policies,” Curtin explained.
The partial U.S. government shutdown, that entered its 28th day on Friday, was just one of the factors weighing on America’s optimism.
Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said last week that while the immediate effects of the shutdown on the U.S. $20.7-trillion economy would be small, the indirect, psychological impact could be substantial.
""Consumers get risk averse and start hunkering down, businesses start planning to do less, and you start magnifying these effects,"" Evans said.
ING economists also warned of the damage that a prolonged government closure could cause.
“The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of walkout and disruption at airports and crime agencies, as staff seek paid employment elsewhere this too will have negative economic implications,” they warned.
Amid the headwinds facing the U.S. consumer in 2019, these experts added the lagged effects of higher borrowing costs, fading support from the fiscal stimulus and weaker external demand at a time of rising trade protectionism.
“These factors will increasingly weigh on sentiment in 2019, which is likely to lead to a slowdown in consumer spending growth,” they said.
Curtin noted that the decline in the index was consistent with a slowdown in the pace of growth, but clarified that it does not yet indicate the start of a sustained downturn in economic activity.
“Nonetheless, consumers now sense a need to buttress their precautionary savings, which is typically done by reducing their discretionary spending,” Curtin said. “Evolving job and wage prospects, which were slightly weaker in early January, are critical to extending the current expansion.”"
333,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 08:31AM ET</span>",Canadian Annual Inflation 2% in December,"Investing.com - The overall rate of inflation in Canada picked up surprisingly strongly in December, giving some welcome respite to a central bank that was criticized earlier this month for being too hawkish with its monetary policy.
The consumer price index rose 2% last month from December 2017, Statistics Canada said on Friday. Prices fell by 0.1% from a month earlier.
Both monthly and annual readings were stronger than forecast. Economists had expected annual inflation to rise by 1.7% and monthly inflation to fall by 0.4%.
The Bank of Canada had said after its last policy-making meeting it still expects to have to raise interest rates this year to reach a 'neutral' policy level, that is, one that that neither stimulates nor depresses activity. Some analysts think that's too much for an economy that's already slowing under the effects of previous rate hikes and other measures aimed largely at reining in the housing market.
By contrast, U.S. Federal Reserve officials have indicated they will slow the pace of monetary tightening this year.
Core inflation, which excludes gasoline, was up 1.7% from a year earlier and fell by 0.2% from the previous month.
The Bank of Canada aims to keep inflation at 2%, the midpoint of a target range of 1% to 3% over the medium term."
334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Economists Downplay Indicators That Say U.S. Recession Is Coming,"(Bloomberg) -- Market-based recession indicators are flashing red. To some economists, they’re better left ignored.
At the moment that’s easier said than done. Among a slew of gauges maintained by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., one based on stocks and credit spreads puts the probability of a recession in the next 12 months at 50 percent, though it was at 70 percent two weeks ago. Another, based on the gap between long-term and short-term Treasury yields -- the so-called yield curve -- puts the figure at 46 percent, according to economist Jesse Edgerton.
When it comes to predicting recessions, market-based models carry one clear advantage: Compared with hard economic data, they’re more forward-looking. But not only can markets get it wrong, they’re also prone to rapid reversal, undermining their reliability as the harbingers of doom.
“Financial markets are efficient, and they can be powerful predictors of future economic conditions, including recessions,” said Joseph Davis, chief economist at Vanguard Group, the mutual-fund giant. “That doesn’t mean they’re always accurate.”
Such caution may be warranted as the U.S. trade dispute with China and the partial U.S. government shutdown drag on. While each looms as a threat to economic activity that has been priced in to financial markets and affected measures of business confidence, neither has seriously damaged U.S. output, and could disappear before that happens.
“If we can get a resolution on just one of these fronts, some of the recession risks should subside,” Davis said.
Equity markets, in particular, are notoriously alarmist. As the late economist Paul Samuelson famously wrote in 1966, stocks had “predicted nine out of the last five recessions.” Its mistakes, he added, “were beauties.”
To its credit, the yield curve has been more reliable. The spread between three-month bills and 10-year Treasuries has inverted before each of the past seven recessions. But the usefulness of that signal is muted because the timing of subsequent recessions is so varied and unpredictable.
According to Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, the time lag from inversion to recession has ranged from nine months for the 1981-82 downturn, to 34 months for the 2001 recession, with no discernible pattern.
The first lesson is to avoid relying on any single indicator. But even composite measures are, at the moment, attracting skepticism. Perli’s own model based on stocks, corporate-bond spreads and various portions of the Treasury yield curve warns of a 56 percent chance of recession within a year. And yet, he advised his clients in a note Tuesday that “these models are best ignored.”
That’s because Perli pins much of the recent market woes on angst over China, which he thinks will eventually ease as monetary policy in China adjusts and prevents a hard landing.
“The markets are expressing worries about the Chinese economy and its potential repercussions on the U.S. economy,” wrote Perli, a former Fed official. “There doesn’t seem to be much specific to the U.S. economy that seems likely to go seriously wrong over the next few quarters.”
While Perli’s optimism over China can be debated, it’s clearer that a potential recession in China is weighing on U.S. financial markets before it’s baked into the economic outlook. In other words, it’s a risk factor but not a hazard that has been struck.
As for the hard economic data, that may be slower than markets to reveal a deteriorating outlook, but less likely to give firms and families a head-fake on what’s coming.
Major Reversal
“You cannot get the equivalent of a thousand-point drop in the real economy in 24 hours, but you can in the financial markets,” said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. “So, if the model you’re looking at is dominated by financial numbers, there’s a much higher chance you can get a major reversal.”
It’s somewhat comforting, then, that the hard data are signaling a slowdown in growth, but no recession. Edgerton said JPMorgan’s “preferred model,” based on economic data, puts the probability of a recession in the next year at 41 percent.
That compares with the 25 percent median chance of a slump seen by economists in a Bloomberg survey earlier this month.
Vanguard’s Davis has a model which blends economic data and market measures and has spit out a 35 percent probability. “We’ll still have growth scares,” he said. “But fate hasn’t been set for 2019.”

335,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 05:45AM ET</span>",UK shoppers rein in spending as Brexit nears,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers cut back on spending in the three months to December for the first time since last spring, adding to evidence of a consumer slowdown as Brexit approaches, data showed on Friday.
Retail sales volumes fell 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter after a 0.2 percent rise in the three months to November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Friday's data chimed with other signs that consumer spending is cooling after a strong summer. 
Businesses are also cutting investment before Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union in late March, leaving the overall economy growing at a snail's pace.
In December alone, retail sales fell 0.9 percent, recoiling after November's Black Friday splurge, but were 3.0 percent higher than a year earlier. 
Both readings were below economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
""A major concern for retailers will be that already cautious consumers further limit their spending in the near term at least due to the heightened uncertainties over Brexit,"" economist Howard Archer from the EY ITEM Club consultancy said.
Sterling and British government bonds were little changed after the data.
The ONS said the value of sales fell for the first time in three years in the three months to December, underlining a squeeze on retailers' profit margins as they battle for customers. 
A survey last week from the British Retail Consortium showed retailers failed to increase Christmas sales for the first time since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago.
Supermarkets Sainsbury's and Morrison missed Christmas sales forecasts though  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) beat them. Clothing retailer Next and department store John Lewis reported a late surge in demand.
The ONS data showed a drop in sales of carpets and floor coverings, possibly reflecting a stalling housing market.
While disarray over Brexit has weighed on consumer confidence, there has been some comfort for households recently with the fastest underlying pay growth since 2008 and inflation falling to an almost two-year low of 2.1 percent.

Highlighting the easing of inflation pressures, the ONS's measure of annual price increases in stores cooled to 0.6 percent in December from 1.3 percent in November, the smallest uptick in more than two years.

Retail sales fell 0.9% in December, and were up only 3.0% from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. 
Economists had forecast a 0.8% decline for the month and a 3.6% gain year-on-year.
The monthly increase in November was also revised down to 1.3% from an initial estimate of 1.4%, while the annual increase was revised down to 3.4% from an initial 3.6% advance.
“The three-month on three-month growth rate..shows that in recent months sales have slowed for both measures and flattened from September 2018 to December 2018,” ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said.
Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to consultancy EY's Item Club, said via Twitter that underlying sales growth was down 0.2% in the fourth quarter, and added that the December figure ""Indicates many retailers aimed to boost sales by major discounting.""
""Not good news for profit margins,"" Archer added."
337,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:12AM ET</span>",Shutdown clouds outlook for consumer-driven U.S. economic growth,"By Nandita Bose and Howard Schneider
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After tax cuts, rising incomes and buoyant stock markets set off a consumer boom in 2018, signs are emerging that the main engine of U.S. economic growth could sputter, and a record-long government shutdown further muddies the waters. 
Federal Reserve officials and many economists have long counted on continued robust consumer spending to keep the economy chugging along, despite headwinds from recent financial markets turbulence, trade conflicts and weakening global growth. 
Now they fear the consumer boom could be on the cusp of a reversal. 
The warning signs span the income spectrum - from the well-heeled possibly cutting back after their stocks got hammered last fall, to the poor potentially getting squeezed if a lingering government shutdown delays food assistance payments.
Economists are also not certain, for example, whether last year's personal income tax cut will lead to higher refunds and boost big-ticket purchases, such as home appliances, typical for this time of year, or whether the windfall was already spent last year when paycheck withholding declined. 
The shutdown, now in its 28th day, could delay refunds and hit companies that rely on consumers spending a chunk of that money on their goods or services. 
The chief financial officer at T-Mobile US told investors last week any delay in refunds was a concern for the company because its prepaid business, roughly 30 percent of sales, was ""particularly sensitive"" to tax refunds.
""Hopefully, this situation doesn't go on too long,"" J. Braxton Carter said.
A delay in refunds could also hurt home improvement chains, such as  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Lowe's Cos Inc and Wayfair Inc that see furniture purchases and early spring projects boost sales. ""We don't see any material impact,"" a Home Depot spokesman said without elaborating. Lowe's and Wayfair did not respond to a request for comment. 
The government shutdown clouds the outlook for spending, retailers and the economy at large because executives and policymakers weigh not the direct impact of 800,000 federal workers going without pay, but also how much it can hurt consumer and business confidence.
Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said last week that while the immediate effects of the shutdown on the U.S. $20.7-trillion economy would be small, the indirect, psychological impact could be substantial. 
""Consumers get risk averse and start hunkering down, businesses start planning to do less, and you start magnifying these effects,"" Evans said. 
Former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen noted a general cooling of business sentiment at a retail trade show in New York last week. ""We are hearing anecdotal reports about businesses beginning to put investment plans on hold because of [economic] uncertainty,"" she said. Those investments could include things like upgrades to a retailer's supply chain, Yellen said. 
Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG told Reuters if the shutdown goes on until the end of the month ""we will shave a couple of percentage points from first quarter (gross domestic product)."" 
Such concerns have spread among Fed officials who now advocate patience before considering any further rate hikes.
FAST FOOD, GROCERS AT RISK 
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, and the 4 percent jump in household spending on goods last year was a major reason the economy probably grew by a healthy 3 percent in 2018. More recently, robust consumption offset weaker-than-expected business investment and the drag from trade, and was expected to mitigate the waning impact of the Trump administration's earlier spending splurge. 
Economists had already anticipated that higher interest rates and trade tensions would slow growth in household spending on goods and services after it hit $13 trillion last year.
The question is how much and the shutdown made the answer more difficult. 
Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard said the economy appeared to be slowing down, noting reports from Macy's, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and other retailers talking of a weak December, and he expected the shutdown to hurt first quarter growth.
""Some of it will come back in the second quarter, but there will be some industries that will see lasting damage such as restaurant operators,"" he told Reuters. 
These would include chains like McDonald's Corp, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), which analysts said will be unable to make up for lost sales to government workers during a shutdown.
The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Brian Cantor, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal's retail performance improvement group, said grocery chains, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Kroger (NYSE:KR), could feel the pinch of weaker discretionary spending. While food staples sales will hold up, typical add-on purchases like batteries, chips, magazines or chocolates will suffer, hurting profit margins. 
Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen expressed this concern last week at a retail trade show. ""From a customer standpoint ... they feel incredibly good about the economy, but very nervous about where are things headed,"" he said.
Walmart declined comment. 
Small, independent retailers, which often serve low-income communities, may also suffer.
While the administration has assured funding through February for government transfer payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food assistance to 19 million low income households, the shutdown has impaired granting new licenses and renewals. 
Peter Larkin, President and Chief Executive of the National Grocers Association, sent a letter to Congress on Jan. 10, saying the shutdown prevents many independent retailers from acquiring SNAP licenses for their newly opened stores, and that more than 2,500 retailers have experienced a lapse or inability to reauthorize their license. 

""The inability to acquire new SNAP licenses for newly-opened or purchased stores could have significant negative impacts to local economies,"" Larkin said.

339,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 11:35AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market strong; mid-Atlantic factory activity improves,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that should continue to underpin the economy.
Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region rebounded in January from near a 2-1/2-year low, driven by a surge in new orders, which could allay concerns that manufacturing production was slowing sharply. 
While the data so far suggest the economy is in relatively good shape, there are concerns an ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government could erode both business and consumer confidence, leading to cuts in spending.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Jan. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 220,000 last week.
The dollar (DXY) gained against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields largely rose while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls portion of January's employment report. 
Claims fell 4,000 between the December and January survey periods. While that would suggest little change in labor market conditions after the economy created 312,000 jobs in December, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history raises the risk of a drop in payrolls.
Some 800,000 government workers missed their first paycheck last Friday because of the partial shutdown, which started on Dec. 22 as President Donald Trump demanded that Congress give him $5.7 billion this year to help build a wall on the country's border with Mexico.
The pay period for most federal employees that includes the week of Jan. 12 runs from Jan. 6 to Jan. 19. About 380,000 workers have been furloughed, while the rest are working without pay. Furloughed workers will probably be counted as unemployed.
""The federal government shutdown could make the payroll jobs number a walking disaster,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Payroll employment is likely to dive in January with perhaps 300 or 400 thousand jobs lost.""
Private contractors working for many government agencies are also without pay. But Trump has signed legislation for all employees to be paid their salaries retroactively when the shutdown ends. Some economists say that could result in the shutdown having a small impact on January payrolls. 
MODEST-MODERATE GROWTH
The Trump administration has been recalling some employees to work without pay in an effort to minimize the fallout from the shutdown. Publication of economic data compiled by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau has been suspended during the shutdown.
That includes December's housing starts and building permits report, which was scheduled for release on Thursday. November's construction, factory orders and trade figures have also been delayed, as well as December retail sales and November business inventories data. 
The incomplete data is making it hard to get a clear read on the economy, which could complicate policy decisions.
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its Beige Book report, which offers a snapshot of the economy, that eight of the U.S. central bank's 12 districts reported ""modest to moderate growth"" in late December and early January.
The Fed noted that while outlooks generally remained positive, ""many districts reported that contacts had become less optimistic.""
That was corroborated by a separate report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showing its business conditions index increased to a reading of 17.0 in January from 9.1 in December, which was its lowest level since August 2016.
The survey's six-month business conditions index increased to a reading of 31.2 this month from 29.9 in December. But its six-month capital expenditures index slipped to a reading of 31.6 in January from 34.5 in the prior month.
Despite the modest rebound in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, the level of activity is lower than it was for most of 2017 and 2018. 
This fits in with other signs that national factory activity is slowing, having hit a two-year low in December. A report from the New York Fed earlier this week showed a second straight monthly drop in its Empire State manufacturing index in January.

""Conditions have certainly downshifted from earlier in 2018 and compared with 2017,"" said Adam Ozimek, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""This reflects simmering risks that threaten to derail the otherwise strong economy.""

The U.S. Department of Labor said that the number of individuals applying for initial jobless benefits in the seven days ended Jan. 12 decreased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000.
Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 3,000 to 219,000 last week from the previous week’s total of 216,000.
The four-week moving average was 220,750, a decline of 1,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended Jan. 5 rose to 1.737 million from 1.719 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an increase to 1.735 million. These claims reflect people who recently lost their jobs and are already receiving benefits.

LONDON (Reuters) - The outlook for Britain's housing market is darkening fast ahead of Brexit, with sales expectations falling to their lowest level in at least 20 years by one measure, surveys showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said the net balance of -28 in December among surveyors about the short-term outlook for housing sales was the weakest since it began asking the question in 1999.
The housing market has slowed since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, with house prices, as measured by mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide, growing at the slowest pace in around five years.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 and there is still no clarity over the terms of its departure, after lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals by a huge margin on Tuesday.
A separate survey from the Bank of England showed lenders in Britain expect demand for mortgages and credit cards will fall by the greatest extent seen for several years.
Its gauge of forecast demand for mortgage lending over the next three months fell to -17.5 in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 0.2 in the third quarter, its lowest level since late 2010.
The BoE survey also showed lenders expect demand for credit card lending to fall at the fastest pace since records started in 2007.
""The (BoE) credit conditions survey added to the evidence that the housing market is currently on the back foot amid heightened uncertainties and challenging conditions. This follows a very weak RICS December report,"" said Howard Archer, economist at the EY ITEM Club consultancy.
Simon Rubinsohn, RICS' chief economist, said December's fall in price expectations was linked to Brexit uncertainty, which has deepened further since parliament rejected May's deal.
(GRAPHIC: UK housing sales expectations hit record low - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SWjq9e)
""Looking a little further out, there is some comfort provided by the suggestion that transactions nationally should stabilize as some of the fog lifts, but that moment feels a way off for many respondents to the survey,"" Rubinsohn said.
In a report in November, the BoE said a ""disorderly"" exit scenario -- involving severe delays at UK borders and financial markets losing confidence in British institutions -- could lead to sterling falling to almost the same value as the dollar, 6.5 percent inflation and a 30 percent fall in house prices.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that sterling's rise after the Brexit vote suggested investors now see less risk of a no-deal Brexit or the prospect of a delay, but added that he would not put much weight on these moves.
RICS' measure of house prices in December was its weakest since August 2012 at -19, below the median forecast of -13 in a Reuters poll of economists.

Prices were expected to remain flat over the next 12 months with the exception of London and south east where they have been falling, RICS said.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through Jan. 7, also highlighted that labor markets remain ""tight,"" raising the difficulty of finding workers, prompting wage increases across skill levels.
""Wages grew throughout the country, with the majority of Districts reporting moderate gains. Wages increased across skill levels, and numerous Districts highlighted rising entry-level wages as firms sought to attract and retain workers and as new minimum wage laws came into effect, the report showed.""
Inflation grew at a moderate pace, with ""the majority of Districts report(ing) modest to moderate increases in prices,"" according to the report. ""Most Districts indicated that firms' input costs had risen, but reports were mixed on whether they could pass the higher costs on to customers.""
The months-long U.S.-China trade dispute appeared to be taking its toll on businesses. ""Reports cited rising materials and freight prices as sources of cost increases, and a number of Districts said that higher tariffs were also a factor,"" according to the Beige Book."
347,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>","U.S. labor market tightens, wages grow moderately: Fed Beige Book","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Labor markets tightened across the United States as businesses struggled to find workers at any skill level and wages generally grew moderately, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its latest report on the economy.
The U.S. central bank's ""Beige Book"" report, a snapshot of the economy gleaned from discussions with business contacts, found tight labor markets across all 12 Fed districts, with a majority reporting moderate wage gains.
A majority of districts also reported modest-to-moderate price increases, with a number saying higher tariffs had driven up costs.
The Fed reported that outlooks for the economy were generally positive, but added that many districts said contacts were less optimistic due to increased financial market volatility, rising short-term interest rates, falling energy prices, and elevated trade and political uncertainty.
The effect of the partial U.S. government shutdown, now in its fourth week, appeared to be muted while the information for the Beige Book was gathered. 
The only mention of a shutdown-related impact came from the Chicago Fed, which said farmers and others were facing greater uncertainty due to the slowed release of government agricultural reports. Payments to farmers impacted by tariffs were also disrupted by the shutdown.
The Fed raised interest rates at its policy meeting last month, its fourth hike of 2018. 
But with inflation showing no sign of rising above the Fed's 2 percent target, and mounting worries about trade policy and slowing global growth, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the central bank will take a ""patient"" approach to rate hikes this year. 
And now, as the record-long government shutdown threatens growth further and the Fed begins preparing for its next policy meeting later this month, many of Powell's fellow policymakers have echoed that sentiment. 
The Beige Book offers a window into what policymakers are seeing and hearing in their own districts, information that they typically draw on when they stake out their own views of the economy at the Fed's rate-setting meetings.
Powell in particular has said he pays close attention to such anecdotes to assess where the economy is heading before it is apparent in the data.

The latest Beige Book was prepared by the Chicago Fed based on information collected on or before Jan. 7, 2019.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 11:46AM ET</span>",U.S. import prices fall; year-on-year drop largest since 2016,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell for a second straight month in December as the cost of petroleum products tumbled and a strong dollar curbed prices of other goods, leading to the largest year-on-year drop in more than two years.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday added to weak producer and consumer prices data in strengthening economists' expectations of a pause in interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve in the near term.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that low inflation afforded policymakers ""the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully"" while they monitored economic data and financial markets for risks to growth. The U.S. central bank has forecast two interest rate increases this year.
""In 2019, we see a weaker inflationary impulse from abroad on domestic prices,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""This will give the Fed some breathing room in adjusting rates slowly.""
Import prices declined 1.0 percent last month after dropping 1.9 percent drop in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices decreasing 1.3 percent in December.
In the 12 months through December, import prices fell 0.6 percent, the biggest year-on-year drop since September 2016, after rising 0.5 percent in November. Prices declined 0.6 percent in 2018, the first calendar year decrease since 2015, after surging 3.2 percent in 2017.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants fell 9.2 percent after tumbling 13.3 percent in November. Imported food prices edged up 0.1 percent in December after dropping 2.2 percent in the prior month.
There were decreases in the cost of capital goods, but prices for motor vehicles and consumer goods eked out small gains. Excluding fuels and food, import prices were unchanged last month after slipping 0.1 percent in November. 
The so-called core import prices rose 0.6 percent in the 12 months through December. Imported core inflation is being restrained by the strong dollar, which gained about 7.5 percent last year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.
Import prices do not include tariffs. The cost of goods imported from China was unchanged last month. Prices for imported Chinese goods fell 0.2 percent in 2018 and have not increased on a calendar year basis since 2011.
DOWNSIDE RISKS
Against the backdrop of low inflation and slowing growth in China and Europe, some economists believe the Fed will not hike interest rates in the first half of 2019. There are signs the U.S. economy slowed at the end of 2018, with consumer and business sentiment surveys weakening sharply in December.
""Downside risks are developing for U.S. inflation,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Therefore, the Fed has the green light to pause until June, if not longer.""
But an ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government, which has delayed the release of data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau, is making it hard to get a good read on the economy and could complicate policy decisions. 
The government partially shut on Dec. 22 amid demands by President Donald Trump that the U.S. Congress give him $5.7 billion this year to help build a wall on the country's border with Mexico. The longest government shutdown in history has delayed the release of December retail sales and November business inventory data, which were scheduled for Wednesday. 
The publication of November construction spending and trade figures has also been delayed, and the December housing starts and building permits report due on Thursday is likely to be postponed. Economists estimate the shutdown is cutting at least two-tenths of a percentage point from quarterly gross domestic product growth every week. 
Other data on Wednesday suggested a recent moderation in mortgage rates was boosting the struggling housing market. The number of people seeking loans to buy a home and to refinance one rose to an 11-month high last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.
Separately, homebuilders sentiment climbed this month, buoyed by optimism over sales conditions now and over the next six months. Homebuilding weighed on economic growth for three straight quarters in 2018.

""While housing activity probably hasn't changed drastically over the past month, the improvement in the NAHB survey suggests that the recent decline in mortgage rates likely has boosted activity somewhat,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The Washington-based industry group's seasonally adjusted gauge on mortgage applications increased 13.5 percent to 411.8 in the week ended Jan. 11. This was the strongest reading since February 2018. 
The MBA's seasonally adjusted barometer on loan requests for home purchases climbed 9.1 percent to 278.5, the highest level since April 2010.
The interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.74 percent for a second week, the lowest since late April, as U.S. bond yields have been held down by concerns partly due to slowing economic growth and trade tension between China and the United States.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. Mortgages - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RnEpRD)
“Uncertainty regarding the government shutdown, slowing global growth, Brexit, a more patient Fed, and a volatile stock market continued to keep rates from increasing,"" the MBA's chief economist, Mike Fratantoni, said in a statement.
Most mortgage rates the association tracks were little changed to lower from the previous week, with the average 15-year rate hitting 4.13 percent, the lowest since April 2018. 
""The spring homebuying season is almost upon us, and if rates stay lower, inventory continues to grow, and the job market maintains its strength, we do expect to see a solid spring market,"" Fratantoni said.
The decline in borrowing costs also enticed homeowners to refinance their homes.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted barometer on refinance applications jumped 18.7 percent to 1,172.4, the highest since March 2018.
The refinancing share of total applications last week grew to 46.8 percent, the largest since January 2018, from 45.8 percent the previous week.
The average mortgage size for refinancing applications reached $353,100, the highest since the MBA began tracking its weekly survey in 1990.

The share of applications for adjustable-rate loans increased to 9.2 percent, the biggest since October 2014.

350,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",Turkey Extends Rate Pause as Currency Laggard Stalks Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank held rates for a third straight meeting as a weak lira stalks an economy still reeling from a summer currency crash. The lira gained.
The Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Murat Cetinkaya kept its benchmark at 24 percent on Wednesday, in line with the forecasts of all but two economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank kept its language largely unchanged from last month’s statement, vowing to deliver “further monetary tightening” if necessary.
“While developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in the inflation outlook, risks to price stability continue to prevail,” it said. “Accordingly, the committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.”
The lira surged after the decision and was trading 1 percent stronger at 5.3945 per dollar at 2:14 p.m. in Istanbul, the biggest increase among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
“The positive market reaction is the latest evidence that high interest rates are a major source of support for the lira,” Rabobank strategist Piotr Matys said after the announcement. “While the sharp slowdown in inflation is a major positive signal, the lira’s volatile start to the year requires a cautious approach to monetary policy.”
The focus now shifts to the central bank’s next meeting, scheduled just weeks before local elections on March 31, as it waits to relieve the strain on the economy. But despite an economic downturn and a slowdown in inflation, policy makers may be reluctant to rush a rate cut after a new bout of tensions with the U.S. over Syria has once again put the lira under pressure.
The Turkish currency was off to the worst start among its peers in emerging markets this year until Wednesday’s rate decision. It was down as much as 10 percent earlier this year before recouping losses to just around 2 percent.Although inflation has slowed for a second month, it remains just above 20 percent from a year earlier, four times the central bank’s target. The slowdown in inflation might allow policy makers to unwind September’s rate hike if sentiment toward the currency improves, Matys said.

That was compared to 2.3% the month before and in line with expectations.
Traders widely expect UK’s central bank to make no changes to interest rates until uncertainty from continuing negotiations over Brexit is resolved.
British Prime Minister Theresa May faced a crushing defeat on Tuesday as the UK parliament rejected her Brexit deal. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called a vote of no confidence in May's government, to be held at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
Analysts postulate that the most likely scenario is an extension of the March 29 deadline when the UK is supposed to officially leave the EU.
“While the margin of May's loss was a surprise, the defeat itself was something the market had been pricing in for a long time and it appears that participants covered shorts in the pound after the vote,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
“The market is now factoring in the March Brexit deadline being extended. In the longer run it may boil down to two scenarios - a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all.”
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose by 0.2% in December.
That matched the prior reading and was in line with forecasts.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, rose by 1.9% in December.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders slowed sharply in November from October in a sign corporate capital expenditure could lose momentum as a bruising U.S.-China trade war spills into the global economy.
The slight 0.02 percent decline month-on-month in core machinery orders, considered a leading indicator of capital expenditure, was well below the median estimate for a 3.5 percent increase and marked a slowdown from a 7.6 percent expansion in October.
A trade war between the United States and China is weighing on growth in the world's two largest economies, which threatens Japan's growth because its exporters could delay investment and hiring due to worries about corporate profits.
Orders from manufacturers fell 6.4 percent in November from October after a 12.3 percent increase in October, due to a decline in orders from manufactures of electronics and steel.
Service-sector orders rose 2.5 percent, slower than a 4.5 percent increase the previous month. Orders from parcel delivery and logistics companies rose in November.
However, a decline in orders from construction and telecommunications companies dragged on growth in orders from the services sector.
""Core"" machinery orders exclude those for ships and from electricity utilities.
Japan's policymakers have long argued that an increase in business investment will contribute to economic growth as companies replace old manufacturing equipment and invest in new technology.
However, the chance of a growth spurt this year driven by corporate investment has dimmed because international trade tensions and slowing global growth could hurt Japan's export-oriented economy.

The potential slowdown in business spending comes at a difficult time for Japan because the government is preparing to raise the nationwide sales tax in October, which is expected to curb consumer spending.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices dropped by the most in more than two years in December as the cost of energy products and trade services fell, adding to signs of tame inflation that may allow the Federal Reserve to be patient about raising interest rates this year.
Other data on Tuesday suggested manufacturing activity slowed further at the start of the year, with a measure of business confidence in New York State tumbling to more than a 1-1/2-year low in January. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that low inflation afforded policymakers ""the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully"" while they monitored economic data and financial markets for risks to growth. The U.S. central bank has forecast two rate increases for 2019.
""We expect the Fed to sit tight until June, and odds are rising that it could be an even longer pause given the absence of an acceleration in inflation, past tightening in financial market conditions, slowing in the global economy and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical events,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand dropped 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in November. That was the first decline since February 2017 and largest decrease since August 2016.
In the 12 months through December, the PPI increased 2.5 percent, matching November's gain. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would slip 0.1 percent in December and gain 2.5 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Wholesale energy prices tumbled 5.4 percent in December, with gasoline falling 13.1 percent after plunging 14.0 percent in the prior month. That offset a 2.6 percent jump in wholesale food prices. Food prices increased 1.3 percent in November.
The cost of services fell 0.1 percent, pulled down by a 0.3 percent drop in the index for trade services, which measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services increased 0.3 percent in November.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged last month. The so-called core PPI increased 0.3 percent in November. In the 12 months through December, the core PPI increased 2.8 percent following a similar rise in November.
Data last week showed the consumer price index falling 0.1 percent in December, the first drop in nine months, amid cheaper gasoline, airline fares, used trucks and motor vehicles as well as motor vehicle insurance. The CPI was unchanged in November. 
Inflation remains tame despite a tightening labor market that is starting to push up wage growth. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, is hovering just below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the producer price inflation data. The dollar rose against the euro after data showing German's economy slowed in 2018 underscored worries about a broader slump in Europe. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell, while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
SHUTDOWN HURTING SENTIMENT 
The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in November after rising 1.8 percent in October. It hit 2 percent in March for the first time since April 2012.
The cost of wholesale healthcare services, which feed into the core PCE price index, increased 0.2 percent in December after gaining 0.1 percent in November.
Core PCE data for December is scheduled for release later this month, but it is likely to be delayed because of the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.
The shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, has delayed the release of data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau, including November trade figures as well as December retail sales and housing starts reports. 
The incomplete data is making it difficult to get a good read on the economy, and analysts have said that could complicate policy decisions. 
Economists also said the impasse in Washington could be hurting business confidence, pointing to a separate report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing its ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions fell to a reading of 3.9 in January from 11.5 in December.
The January reading was the lowest since May 2017 and reflected a slowdown in new orders and hiring. The New York Fed survey suggests national manufacturing activity likely moderated further in January after hitting a two-year low in December. 

""The Empire State survey is an early indication that conditions continued to deteriorate early this year,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We think the government shutdown is probably adversely affecting business sentiment, although the size of its impact is hard to gauge.""

Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy grew by 1.5 percent in 2018, the weakest rate in five years and markedly slower than the previous year, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, in a sign that exporters in Europe's largest economy are being hit by trade tensions.
German companies are struggling with a cooling of the global economy and tariff disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies. The risk that Britain will leave the European Union without a deal in March is another uncertainty.
The preliminary GDP estimate published by the Federal Statistics Office was in line with market expectations and compared with a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2017.
""The German economy thus grew the ninth year in a row, although growth has lost momentum,"" the statistics office said, adding that growth was mainly driven by domestic demand with household consumption and state spending up on the year.
Company investments in machinery and equipment were particularly strong, rising by 4.5 percent on the year.
This helped to offset a slowdown in export growth which nearly halved to 2.4 percent, from 4.6 percent in 2017.
As imports grew at a faster pace than exports, net trade had a slightly negative effect on overall growth, the office said.
""Measured with the high expectations from one year ago, German economic growth was clearly disappointing,"" KfW chief economist Joerg Zeuner said. 
The head of the DIW economic institute, Marcel Fratzscher, pointed to strong domestic activity and the record state budget surplus of nearly 60 billion euros ($68.61 billion), which are both seen driving growth this year as well.
""The strong labor market with rising employment and healthy wage hikes will help to maintain private consumption as the main pillar of economic growth,"" Fratzscher said.
""The trade disputes and the uncertainty surrounding a recession in the U.S. in the coming two years are probably the biggest risks for the economy.""
German exports to China grew nearly 10 percent year-on-year from January to November, while exports to Britain fell by 3.6 percent in the same period, the office said.
""The overall impact of Brexit on German economic growth is impossible to quantify,"" an official of the statistics office told a news conference in Berlin.
British lawmakers look set to reject the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU by Prime Minister Theresa May in a vote later on Tuesday, leaving unclear what form Brexit on March 29 will take or even if it will happen at all.
Q4 GROWTH
The Statistics Office said the economy probably grew slightly in the fourth quarter of 2018, which would mean it escaped recession -- defined as two or more consecutive quarters of negative growth.
There was also a slightly positive statistical overhang at the end of 2018, suggesting the economy is carrying modest growth momentum into 2019, the office said.
Policymakers and economists are racking their brains over how much the slowdown is caused by one-off factors or if there are more fundamental, structural problems at play.
The statistics office pointed to domestic bottlenecks in new car registrations due to the introduction of stricter pollution standards, and a summer drought that caused disruptions to deliveries by river ferry of fuel and other raw materials.
But the economy's weak performance in the fourth quarter suggests that the contraction from July to September was more than just a blip and that Germany has reached peak growth.
A string of unexpectedly weak data also from other European countries has pointed to a cooling in the euro zone economy as a whole, possibly making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to raise interest rates anytime soon.

European Union statistics office Eurostat said on Tuesday that the trade surplus of the 19-nation euro zone was 19.0 billion euros ($21.7 billion) on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, down from 23.4 billion euros in November 2017.
Imports were up 4.7 percent, while exports rose a more modest 1.9 percent.
The trade balance was also down by a similar percentage for the 11 months to November.
Eurostat does not provide a breakdown of figures for the euro zone, but for the EU as a whole, energy imports were 25 percent higher in Jan-Nov 2018 than a year earlier. Exports of energy rose by 17 percent. For other product types, there was no major mismatch between the growth rates of exports and of imports.
Over the same 11 month period, the EU's trade surplus with the United States and its deficit with China both grew. The EU's trade deficits with its main energy suppliers Russia and Norway also increased.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the euro zone's trade surplus actually increased to 15.1 billion euros from 13.5 billion euros in October. Exports decreased by 1.0 percent, while imports fell by 1.9 percent.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Hot labor market won't cause rapid rise in wages: SF Fed paper,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A hot labor market marked by extremely low unemployment will not drive a sudden or sharp rise in wages, according to research published by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank on Monday. 
""There is no evidence of a meaningful increase in wage growth as unemployment rates fall below 4 percent,"" wrote San Francisco Fed economists Sylvain Leduc, Chitra Marti, and Daniel J. Wilson in the bank's latest Economic Letter. ""We do not foresee a sharp pickup in wage growth nationally if the labor market continues to tighten as many anticipate."" 
The U.S. unemployment rate, which last month ticked up to 3.9 percent, ran below 4 percent for the entire second half of 2018, and Fed officials expect it to stay below 4 percent for another three years. And yet wages have generally grown at less than 3 percent annually, hardly a blistering pace though generally in line with productivity growth and inflation.
Relatively tepid wage growth is one reason a couple of the Fed's most dovish policymakers are calling for a pause in Fed rate hikes to allow labor markets to tighten further and give people a better shot at earning more. Inflation, they argue, is well-contained, and slow wage growth suggests the labor market might have more slack than thought.
The current paper, which suggests that wage trajectory isn't likely to change even if unemployment falls further, may offer a window into the thinking San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, whose own research on labor markets makes her one of the top experts in the field around the Fed's policysetting table. 
The paper's lead author, the bank's chief of research, accompanied Daly to her first two Fed meetings since she started the job on Oct. 1. 
The paper uses state-by-state data and comes with an important caveat: the kind of localized tight labor markets that often push state unemployment well below 4 percent might not adequately predict what happens when tight labor markets are a national phenomenon. 
If just one small area of the country experiences very low unemployment, people may flood in from other parts of the country to find jobs, muting wage growth. 
But, the authors write, ""the typical pattern of local wage growth in a tight local labor market may differ when all other nearby labor markets are experiencing similar tightness, as is currently the case.""

The government was targeting a primary budget surplus — which excludes debt-servicing costs — of 3.604 billion euros for the January-to-December period.
The surplus underperformed the target by 443 million euros.
The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security funds and local administration. It differs from the figure monitored by Greece's foreign lenders but does indicate the state of the country's finances.
Net tax revenue came in at 53.6 billion euros - 1.56 billion euros below target. Spending reached 55.99 billion euros - 1.08 billion euros below target.
The government projects a primary budget surplus of 4.0 percent of economic output in 2018 and 3.6 percent this year, according to its 2019 budget.
The post-bailout target set by Greece's lenders is for a primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial output posted in November its biggest fall in nearly three years, data showed on Monday, stoking concerns about the currency bloc's economic growth in the final quarter of 2018 and casting doubt over the timing of the next rate hike.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated that industrial production in the 19-nation euro zone tumbled by 1.7 percent in November month-on-month, its worst reading since February 2016, after a modest, downwardly revised 0.1 percent rise in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a drop but smaller than official estimates show. Markets expectations were for a 1.5 percent monthly drop and a 2.3 percent fall year-on-year.
The poor output data increased pessimism about the bloc's growth, which seems now more likely to remain slow in the last three months of last year.
""The euro zone has clearly shifted down a gear,"" said Andrew Kenningham, an economist at research firm Capital Economics.
He said the bloc could still eke out a small increase in its gross domestic product in the last quarter, but the new output figures sent a negative signal. 
The euro zone's economy grew by only 0.2 percent in the third quarter, down from growth of 0.4 percent in the second quarter. Hopes of a rebound are now receding.
Despite better-than-expected retail trade data in November which showed consumers are still willing to spend, a gloomier mood among investors is likely to affect investment.
The output reading fell mostly because of a large drop in the production of capital goods, such as machinery.
ECB HEADACHE
Slower growth in the last quarter could force the European Central Bank to review its forecast of a 1.7 percent GDP rise for all-2018.
Low growth and an easing of the inflation rate in December from the ECB's target make a rate hike this year less likely, ING economist Bert Colijn said.
The ECB promised in December to keep rates at current record lows at least until the summer and also made no attempt to change market expectations that a first post-crisis interest rate rise will come only in early 2020.
The weak euro zone output data followed negative readings in the bloc's main economies published in recent days, which prompted economists to raise the risks of recession in Germany and Italy.
Germany, the largest economy in the euro zone, saw its industrial output fall by 1.9 percent in November on the month against earlier forecasts of a 0.3 percent rise, data released last week showed.
Production also fell markedly and by more than predicted in France and Italy, the second and third biggest economies in the bloc, national statistics offices said last week.

At euro zone level, the fall was mostly caused by the large monthly 2.3 percent drop in the production of capital goods and by a 1.7 percent fall in the output of durable consumer goods such as fridges.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 05:02AM ET</span>","China's exports shrink most in two years, raising risks to global economy","By Yawen Chen and Martin Quin Pollard
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December, while imports also contracted, pointing to further weakness in the world's second-largest economy in 2019 and deteriorating global demand.
Adding to policymakers' worries, data on Monday also showed China posted its biggest trade surplus with the United States on record in 2018, which could prompt President Donald Trump to turn up the heat on Beijing in their bitter trade dispute.
Softening demand in China is being felt around the world, with slowing sales of goods from iPhones to automobiles, prompting warnings from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and from Jaguar Land Rover, which last week announced sweeping job cuts. 
The dismal December trade readings suggest China's economy may have cooled faster than expected late in the year, despite a slew of growth-boosting measures in recent months ranging from higher infrastructure spending to tax cuts.
Some analysts had already speculated that Beijing may have to speed up and intensify its policy easing and stimulus measures this year after factory activity shrank in December.
China's December exports unexpectedly fell 4.4 percent from a year earlier, with demand in most of its major markets weakening. Imports also saw a shock drop, falling 7.6 percent in their biggest decline since July 2016.
Analysts had expected export growth to slow to 3 percent with imports up 5 percent.
""Today's data reflect an end to export front-loading and the start of payback effects, while the global slowdown could also weigh on China's exports,"" Nomura economists wrote in a note, referring to a surge in shipments to the U.S. over much of last year as companies rushed to beat further tariffs.
""The export growth print also suggests that the recent strength of the yuan might be short-lived; Beijing will perhaps be more eager to strike a trade deal with the U.S.; and that policymakers will need to take more aggressive measures to stabilize GDP growth.""
Net exports had already been a drag on China's economic growth in the first three quarters of last year, after giving it a boost in 2017.
Asian shares and U.S. stock market futures fell as the surprisingly weak Chinese data added to fears of weaker corporate profits and investment, while the yuan currency gave up some of its early gains.[MKTS/GLOB]
HIGHER TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S.
China's politically-sensitive surplus with the U.S. widened by 17.2 percent to $323.32 billion last year, the highest on record going back to 2006, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data.
China's large trade surplus with the United States has long been a sore point with Washington, which has demanded Beijing take steps to sharply reduce it.
Washington imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods last year and has threatened further action if Beijing does not change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own. 
However, Beijing's export data had been surprisingly resilient to tariffs for much of 2018, possibly because companies ramped up shipments before broader and stiffer U.S. duties went into effect. 
As many market watchers predicted, that boost has faded in the last few months. China exports to the U.S. declined 3.5 percent in December while its imports from the U.S. were down 35.8 percent for the month.
China's total global exports rose 9.9 percent in 2018, its strongest performance in seven years, while imports increased 15.8 percent.
But December's gloomy data, along with several months of falling factory orders, suggest a further weakening in its exports in the near term.
""A trade recession is likely, in our view,"" Raymond Yeung, chief economist at ANZ, said in a note, predicting a period of export contraction similar to 2015-16.
""The global electronics cycle remains the key driver of Chinese exports. A potential downturn in the sector poses the real risk to China's external outlook even if China and the U.S. reach a resolution on their trade dispute.""
ING said a fall in electronic shipments could be related to foreign companies avoiding using China-made electronic components, adding that exports and imports of electronic parts and goods will likely shrink this year. 
WEAK IMPORTS HIGHLIGHT SOFTENING DEMAND
The higher tariffs China levied on U.S. supplies also hit overall import growth. For all of 2018, soybeans, the second largest imports from the U.S., fell for the first time since 2011.
Even if Washington and Beijing reach a trade deal in their current round of talks, it would be no panacea for China's slowing economy, analysts say.
""The import slowdown is consistent with other signs that growth in China's domestic economy continued to weaken,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
""Overall economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter and remains under pressure from weaker exports, slow credit growth and cooling real estate activity.""
Chinese policymakers are widely expected to roll out more support measures in coming months if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate.
Early this month, the central bank said it would slash banks' reserve requirements -- the fifth such cut in a year -- as it tries to encourage more lending and reduce the risk of a sharp slowdown.
""If pressure on the economy is still relatively large in the first half, a cut every quarter should be highly likely,"" said Xu Gao, chief economist at Everbright Securities. 
In an annual meeting of top leaders last month, China said it will boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and stepping up policy adjustments.
A few analysts believe interest rate cuts are a possibility, but most expect Beijing will refrain from massive stimulus measures like those deployed in the past, due to worries that it could add to a mountain of debt and weaken the yuan. 

Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing is planning to lower its economic growth target to 6-6.5 percent this year after an expected 6.6 percent in 2018, the slowest pace in 28 years.

364,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",Cheaper gasoline weighs on U.S. consumer prices in December,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in nine months in December amid a plunge in gasoline prices, but underlying inflation pressures remained firm as rental housing and healthcare costs rose steadily.
Overall, the report from the Labor Department on Friday painted a picture of inflation that was under control, with increases in some categories offset by declines elsewhere. This likely supports recent statements by Federal Reserve officials pledging patience in raising interest rates this year.
""The Fed will take this as further proof that price pressures are building more slowly than some have feared based on the strong growth of late and tight labor market,"" said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. ""It certainly seems to justify the Fed's message about being more patient on rate increases.""
The Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, the first drop and weakest reading since March, after being unchanged in November. In the 12 months through December, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, slowing from November's 2.2 percent gain.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.2 percent, advancing by the same margin for a third straight month. In the 12 months through December, the so-called core CPI rose 2.2 percent, matching November's increase.
December's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations. The CPI rose 1.9 percent in 2018, slowing from a 2.1 percent increase in 2017. But the core CPI jumped 2.2 percent, up from 1.8 percent in 2017.
The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy. 
The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent year-on-year in November after rising 1.8 percent in October. It hit 2 percent in March for the first time since April 2012.
The U.S. central bank has forecast two interest rate hikes this year, but several policymakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have said they would be cautious about tightening monetary policy. 
Powell reiterated that view on Thursday, saying ""especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully"" while the central bank monitored economic data and financial markets for risks to growth.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Dec. 18-19 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed ""many"" officials were of the view that the Fed ""could afford to be patient about further policy firming.""
But with core inflation remaining firm despite a strong dollar and slowing global growth, economists say further rate increases this year cannot be ruled out. In addition, a tighter labor market is boosting wage growth. 
""If core inflation holds firm, the Fed will continue to consider additional rate hikes this year,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Fed lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after a five-day rally.
BOOST TO PURCHASING POWER
Low inflation is boosting households' purchasing power, which could keep consumer spending supported. While the economy likely posted strong growth in the fourth quarter, an ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government is casting a cloud on the economy. 
The partial closure started on Dec. 22 as President Donald Trump demanded that the U.S. Congress give him $5.7 billion this year to help build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.
According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) the shutdown, which has left 800,000 employees furloughed or working without pay and delayed the release of data from the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis, was subtracting 0.1-0.2 percentage point from quarterly gross domestic product growth each week.
Inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings surged 0.7 percent in December, the biggest gain since August 2015, after slipping 0.1 percent in November. Weekly earnings increased 1.2 percent in the 12 months to December, the most since July 2016, from 0.6 percent in November. 
Last month, gasoline prices dropped 7.5 percent, the largest decrease since February 2016, after tumbling 4.2 percent in November. But Americans paid more for food, with prices rising 0.4 percent. That was the biggest gain since May 2014 and followed a 0.2 percent rise in November. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, advanced 0.2 percent in December after rising 0.3 percent in November. Healthcare costs increased 0.3 percent last month after jumping 0.4 percent in November. 
Apparel prices were unchanged in December after dropping 0.9 percent in the prior month. Airline fares tumbled 1.5 percent and prices for used motor vehicles and trucks fell 0.2 percent after rising for two straight months. 

But prices for household furnishings increased, likely because of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on a range of imported Chinese goods. New motor vehicle prices were unchanged for a second straight month.

Both readings matched the reading in the prior month and were in line with consensus forecasts.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew at its weakest pace in half a year in the three months to November as factories suffered from tough global trade conditions and the approach of Brexit, official data showed on Friday.
Gross domestic product was 0.3 percent higher than in the previous three-month period, down from growth of 0.4 percent in the three months to October and matching the consensus of a Reuters poll of economists.
Manufacturers suffered their longest period of monthly declines in output since the financial crisis, hurt by weaker overseas demand, the Office for National Statistics said.
Looking at November alone, industrial output dropped 1.5 percent on the year -- the biggest fall since August 2013.
Worries about the global economy have been mounting due to concerns about a trade war between the United States and China. Figures from Germany and France earlier this week also showed falling industrial output. 
""There may well be a common theme which is hurting the factory sector throughout Europe, for example changes in the auto industry,"" Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said, adding that Brexit worries were also weighing on investment.
Carmakers across Europe have suffered from a fall in demand for diesel vehicles due to pollution concerns.
Sterling and British government bonds were little changed by Friday's figures.
The figures fit with business and consumer surveys that suggest the economy is slowing sharply after robust growth of 0.6 percent in the third quarter of the year, reflecting growing uncertainty ahead of Brexit, as well as global jitters.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 and whether businesses will still be able to trade without disruption to cross-border supply chains remains unclear.
Prime Minister Theresa May risks losing a parliamentary vote on Tuesday on the deal she has agreed with the EU. Defeat would leave open the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without any transitional arrangements to smooth the economic shock.
Compared with a year earlier, Britain's economy was 1.4 percent larger. In November alone, it expanded 0.2 percent, compared with forecasts for a rise of 0.1 percent.
The Bank of England says the economy is likely to have grown around 0.2 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018.
Closely watched purchasing managers' surveys have pointed to fourth-quarter growth of around 0.1 percent in Britain, according to data firm IHS Markit which compiles the surveys. 
Britain's economy slowed after the June 2016 Brexit vote, its growth rate slipping from top spot among the Group of Seven group of rich nations to mid-table or lower.
An unusually warm summer and the soccer World Cup spurred a pick-up in mid-2018 but retail sales data suggest consumers reined in spending late last year.
Britain's services sector grew by 0.3 percent over the three months to November, while industrial output dropped by 0.8 percent, the biggest decline since May 2017.
Separate figures showed Britain's goods trade deficit widened unexpectedly in November to 12.0 billion pounds ($15.3 billion) from 11.9 billion pounds, worsened by the highest oil imports since September 2014.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to set a lower economic growth target of 6-6.5 percent in 2019 compared with last year's target of ""around"" 6.5 percent, policy sources told Reuters, as Beijing gears up to cope with higher U.S. tariffs and weakening domestic demand. 
The proposed target, to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in March, was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in mid-December, according to four sources with knowledge of the meeting's outcome. 
Data later this month is expected to show the Chinese economy grew around 6.6 percent in 2018 - the weakest since 1990. Analysts are forecasting a further loss of momentum this year before policy support steps begin to kick in. 
""It's very difficult for growth to exceed 6.5 percent (this year), and there could be trouble if growth dips below 6 percent,"" said one source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
As the world's second-largest economy loses steam, China's top leaders are closely watching employment levels as factories could be forced to shed workers amid a trade war with the United States, despite a more resilient services sector, policy insiders said.
Growth of about 6.2 percent is needed in the next two years to meet the ruling Communist Party's longstanding goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020, and to turn China into a ""modestly prosperous"" nation.
""Considering employment, income and stability, we need growth of at least 6 percent this year,"" said one of the sources.
Adopting a range as a target would give policymakers room to maneuver amid uncertainties caused by a tit-for-tat tariff war with the United Sates, as the two sides strive for a possible deal to settle their differences before March.
The government plans to maintain a 3 percent consumer inflation target for 2019 despite a recent softening in price rises, leaving some space for the government to stimulate weaker consumption.
Data this week showed China's consumer inflation eased to 1.9 percent in December from 2.2 percent in November, below the government's full-year target. 
The State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
MORE STIMULUS SEEN
Chinese leaders have turned more pro-growth since the December meeting, softening a drive to rein in financial and debt risks, but they have ruled out ""flood-like"" stimulus.
""The pressure on the economy is quite big, and overall policy focus is stability this year and even next year,"" said one of the sources.
The central bank is likely to pump out more cash by further lowering banks' reserve requirements, following a broad-based cut this month, while trying to funnel more credit to small and private firms - vital for growth and jobs, policy sources said.
Policymakers remain reluctant to cut benchmark interest rates despite easing pressure on the yuan, fearing any moves could spur capital outflows as China's short-term bond yields have fallen below those of the United States, they said.
The government is expected to step up fiscal stimulus this year with steeper tax cuts to help corporates and an increase in spending on infrastructure projects, the sources said.
The annual budget deficit could rise from last year's 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, but is likely to be kept below 3 percent, the sources said without giving specific figures.
Local governments could be allowed to issue up to 2 trillion yuan worth of special bonds in 2019, up from 1.35 trillion yuan last year, they said.
On tax cuts, the focus will be on possibly lowering valued-added tax (VAT), which ranges from 6 percent for the services sector and 16 percent for manufacturers. Such taxes account for more than a third of total government revenues.

Policymakers are unlikely to loosen controls on the property market across the country, but may give provincial and city governments more leeway in tweaking polices to keep local markets steady, the sources said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could further assuage concerns about the economy's health.
The report from the Labor Department on Thursday followed data last week showing employers hired the most workers in 10 months in December and increased wages.
Surveys showing steep declines in consumer and manufacturing activity in December had stoked fears that the economy was rapidly losing momentum against the backdrop of tightening financial market conditions and slowing global growth.
""There are increasing risks and caution over the economic outlook in 2019, but jobless claims say the seas are calm and it looks to be smooth sailing for the economy for now,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended Jan. 5. Data for the prior week was revised up to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims declining to 225,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Puerto Rico were estimated last week.
While labor market strength suggests the economy remains on a solid path of expansion, tighter financial market conditions and cooling global growth could make the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates this year.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Dec. 18-19 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed ""many"" officials were of the view that the Fed ""could afford to be patient about further policy firming.""
The Fed has forecast two rate hikes this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and several policymakers have said they would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. 
U.S. financial market were little moved by the claims data, with investors watching developments surrounding trade talks between the United States and China. Stocks on Wall Street fell after a four-day rally, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. The dollar firmed slightly against a basket of currencies.
FEDERAL WORKER CLAIMS RISE
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,500 to 221,750 last week.
The economy created 312,000 jobs in December. The unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.9 percent as some unemployed Americans piled into the labor market, confident of their job prospects.
Claims were boosted in the week ending Dec. 29 as workers furloughed because of a partial shutdown of the U.S. government applied for benefits. The federal government partially closed on Dec. 22 as President Donald Trump demanded that the U.S. Congress give him $5.7 billion this year to help build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.
The shutdown, which has affected a quarter of the government, including the Commerce Department, has left 800,000 employees furloughed or working without pay. Private contractors working for many government agencies are also not getting paid.
Claims by federal workers are reported separately and with a one-week lag. The number of federal employees filing for jobless benefits increased by 3,831 to 4,760 in the week ending Dec. 29. Furloughed federal government workers can submit claims for unemployment benefits, but payment would depend on whether Congress decides to pay their salaries retroactively. 
With no sign that the stalemate over the border wall will end anytime soon, economists expect more federal government employees will file claims for unemployment benefits. Federal workers were scheduled to be paid on Friday for the Dec. 23 to Jan. 5 period.
""The 800,000 workers currently furloughed will obviously get nothing,"" said Omair Sharif, a senior economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York. ""So as it became clear during the week that there was no end to the shutdown, it wouldn't be surprising if a number of them filed a claim this week.""
There was a surge in claims filed by federal government employees during the shutdown in October 2013. 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 28,000 to 1.72 million for the week ended Dec. 29. 

November's wholesale inventories report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which was scheduled for release on Thursday, will not be published because of the government shutdown.

372,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Fed Minutes Make Powell’s Press Conference Look Like a Flub,"(Bloomberg) -- A market-soothing set of minutes to the Federal Reserve’s Dec. 18-19 policy meeting raised questions Wednesday over why investors didn’t get that same message three weeks ago.
Instead, the Fed signaled “some further gradual increases” in interest rates were on the way. Chairman Jerome Powell followed with a press conference that investors felt was overly dismissive of sharp price drops and volatility. Already down about 13 percent from the end of September, stocks skidded another 1.5 percent that day.
“He could have handled that differently, and better,” said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington.
Powell did, Perli noted, say very early in his press conference that low inflation “gives the committee the ability to be patient in moving forward.” That’s pretty much the same message that he struck in Atlanta on Jan. 4, that other FOMC members have repeated in recent days, and which has helped lift the S&P 500 Index by about 10 percent from its Dec. 24 low.
Still, “he didn’t really beat it over and over like he should have,” said Perli. “When the market is on edge, it helps repeating things over and over.”
‘Automatic Pilot’
Another misstep in Perli’s mind: saying the balance sheet run-off was on “automatic pilot” was a note of stubbornness the market didn’t want to hear.
The policy statement, and the tone Powell set on Dec. 19, stand in particular contrast to a section in the minutes describing the committee’s outlook for monetary policy.
“Many participants expressed the view that, especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures, the committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming,” the minutes said. “A number of participants noted that, before making further changes to the stance of policy, it was important for the committee to assess factors,” such as how growing risks and past policy moves might affect the economy.
Not that Powell deserves all the blame. The Fed must be wary of appearing to respond too readily to a bout of market volatility with a policy shift. The chairman was also under pressure from President Donald Trump to stop raising rates. That pressure “may have been part of his reluctance to deliver too dovish a message too quickly,” Perli said.
Another Explanation
But there may also be another explanation for the disconnect between the minutes and Powell’s Dec. 19 press conference, according to Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish, part of BNY Mellon Investment Management.
Reinhart, a former director of the Fed’s division of monetary affairs, said Fed officials may have molded the minutes in a way that was designed to react to the market’s negative reaction.
“What I think happened is Jay Powell accurately conveyed the sense of the committee as he understood it in the opening statement and in the press conference, and it was not received particularly well,” he said. “After the fact, they emphasized, with more sensitivity, something that the chair regretted not having emphasized.”
The minutes, Reinhart said, are nothing like the full transcript of FOMC meetings that gets published five years later. “They have to be true,” he said about the minutes, but they can significantly alter the message that emerges through decisions on what gets included and what gets emphasized.
Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) LLC, agreed.
“I have always been skeptical of the claim that these purely reflect the climate on the day,” he said of the minutes. “If I were Powell, I’d rather convey the message of patience and be accused of having been a little bit misleading on the day’’ of the meeting.

The data was ""consistent with evidence elsewhere of cooling domestic demand,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
Slower inflation will give Beijing ""plenty of room to loosen (monetary) policy,"" said Evans-Pritchard in a note on Thursday. ""If anything, cooling factory gate inflation will strengthen the case for the central bank to do more to ease financial pressure on industrial firms including by cutting benchmark lending rates,"" he said referring to producer inflation.

The sharply decelerating pace brings back fears of a return of the deflation which ravaged corporate profits in 2012-2016. A return of slow or falling factory prices in China would squeeze corporate profitability and put pressure on global inflation, as export prices usually follow those at factory gate.
""Deflationary pressures are on the rise in China, driven by weakening domestic and export demand,"" China International Capital Corp. economists Eva Yi and Liang Hong wrote in a note ahead of the data.

376,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 02:02PM ET</span>","Fed Leans Dovish on Global Growth Worries, Rocky Markets, Minutes Show","Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers expressed more willingness to adopt a slower pace of rate hikes at their December meeting, as concerns about global growth and subdued inflation made the timing of future rate hikes less certain, minutes published Wednesday showed.
The Fed raised its benchmark rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Dec. 19 and signalled two rate hikes were on the table for 2019.
While Fed members at the meeting supported ""some further gradual"" rate hikes, there was increasing uncertainty about the timing of hikes, as worsening financial conditions and slowing global growth clouded the path to future rate hikes, according to the minutes.
""Participants expressed that recent developments, including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth, made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier,"" the Fed said in the minutes. ""Against this backdrop, many participants expressed the view that, especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures, the Committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming.""
The Fed's somewhat dovish outlook expressed in minutes echoed a recent shift in tone on policy tightening from Fed members, including Chairman Jerome Powell, prompting some to predict the Fed may raise rates just once, if at all, this year.
In his press conference that followed the Fed’s December meeting, Powell said the central bank’s balance sheet trimming was on “autopilot.” But he walked back those comments last week, reassuring investors the Fed would be flexible with all of its policy tools, including the balance sheet.
""If incoming information prompted meaningful reassessments of the economic outlook and attendant risks, either to the upside or the downside, their (Fed members) policy outlook would change,"" the minutes said.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, traders believe there's little chance the Fed will hike rates this year, pricing in a roughly 25% chance of a hike in the second half of the year.
The pace of economic growth, while expected to remain ""strong"" over the next two years is predicted to slow.
""Over the 2018-20 period real GDP was forecast to rise at a rate above the staff's estimate of potential output growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021,"" the minutes said.
The minutes also showed that Fed members were split on the inflation outlook as ""a few participants pointed to the decline in longer-term inflation compensation as an indication that longer-run inflation expectations may have edged lower, while several others cited survey-based measures as suggesting that longer-run expectations likely remained anchored.""
In a sign that the Fed is preparing to take a more data-driven approach to future policy decisions, the minutes highlighted that ""several participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate over upcoming meetings to remove forward guidance entirely and replace it with language emphasizing the data-dependent nature of policy decisions.""
The release of the minutes comes as some on Wall Street voiced concerns about U.S. economic growth in the wake of the weaker ISM manufacturing and services reports.
""Following the moves in financial conditions, oil prices and foreign growth, we expect the 2019 slowdown to be more pronounced in the more sensitive areas of manufacturing and business investment, reminiscent of the 2015 to 2016 episode,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients earlier this week."

(Reuters) -  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) reported lower-than-expected quarterly home sales and orders on Wednesday, confirming fears that the U.S. housing market is slowing in the face of higher interest rates and rising prices after years of robust growth.
The company also put off giving a forecast for 2019 citing ""continued softness and uncertainty"" in the housing market.
Rising labor and raw material costs have led builders to increase home prices. This, combined with higher interest rates, led some homebuyers to defer their purchases.
Wall Street analysts expect demand for homes to be sluggish this year as job growth slows and mortgage rates continue to rise.
""We remain cautious on the homebuilding stocks given our outlook for a fairly tepid recovery in housing starts to continue in 2019, along with moderating builder fundamentals over the next two years,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut said.
The Miami-based company joins a host of other builders that have warned of weakening demand. In November, larger homebuilder D.R.Horton (N:DHI) forecast weak home sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and did not provide any details of its sales and profit expectations for the year.
""We continue to believe that the housing market is adjusting to a temporary disconnect between sales prices and buyer expectations,"" Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said.
Lennar, which bought smaller rival CalAtlantic last year, said sales surged 64 percent to 14,154 homes in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, but were below analysts' average expectation of 14,485 units, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Orders soared 44.2 percent to 10,611 homes, but missed estimate of 11,174 units.
Excluding items, Lennar earned $1.96 per share.
Total revenue rose 70.6 percent to $6.46 billion.
Analysts on average had expected revenue of $6.53 billion and earnings per share of $1.92.

Up to Tuesday's close, Lennar's shares had fallen 36.2 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 27.6 percent decline in the PHLX Housing Index (HGX). They were marginally up before the opening bell in light trading.

As expected, the BoC said it was holding its overnight cash rate steady at 1.75%.
The BoC cited forecasts that the global economic expansion was expected to moderate to 3.4% this year from 3.7% in 2018 and pointed to an expected slowdown “to a more sustainable pace” for the U.S. economy.
“However, there are increasing signs that the US-China trade conflict is weighing on global demand and commodity prices,” the BOC said in its statement.
In its monetary policy statement, the BoC cut its forecast for growth in the Canadian economy to 1.7% in 2019, compared to the prior 2.1%, placing the blame on the recent decline in oil prices.
The central bank also noted that inflation would likely remain below 2% for much of 2019 due to lower gasoline prices. 
“Weighing all of these factors, Governing Council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise over time into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target,” the BoC concluded.
Analysts had widely anticipated that the Canadian central bank would stand pat, given decreasing oil prices and easing wage inflation, but still forecast an additional two hikes for this year.
“With core inflation measures still sitting around the 2% target and unemployment at a 40-year low, we still expect to see at least two further Bank of Canada rate hikes this year,” ING economist James Smith said."

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage applications increased 23.5 percent to 362.7 in the week ended Jan. 4. It was the largest weekly increase since October 2015 and the index's highest level since July.
“Mortgage rates fell across the board last week and applications rebounded sharply, after what was a slower than usual holiday period,"" Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
The increase was led by the largest surge in mortgage refinancing applications in four years and comes as the interest rate on 30-year fixed rate mortgages fell to 4.74 percent last week from 4.84 percent the week before. That is the lowest that key borrowing rate has been since late April.
The share of refinancing of total applications grew to 45.8 percent, its largest since February 2018, compared with 42.7 percent the week before.
Applications for mortgages to purchase a home jumped 16.53 percent from a week earlier.
“Purchase applications had their strongest week in a month, finishing over 4 percent higher than a year ago, as both conventional and government purchase activity bounced back with solid gains after a sluggish holiday season,” Kan said.
Thirty-year mortgage rates on loan balances of $484,350 or less topped out at 5.17 percent in November as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled its intent to press ahead with its three-year-old campaign of interest rate increases. 
But Fed officials recently signaled they would likely slow their pace of rate hikes after signs of tightening financial conditions including the biggest December swoon for U.S. stocks since the Great Depression.
U.S. Treasury bond yields have fallen since then, and mortgage rates, most sensitive to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR), have followed suit. The 10-year yield was last trading just below 2.75 percent, roughly half a percentage point below its early-November high.

The EU statistics office Eurostat said unemployment in the 19-country currency bloc dropped to 7.9 percent in November, the lowest level since October 2008, and below economists' forecasts of an 8.1 percent rate.
Eurostat also revised down its October reading to 8.0 percent from a previous estimate of 8.1 percent.
The fall was partly caused by a drop of the number of jobless in Italy and Spain which still have the highest unemployment rates in the euro zone after Greece.
Unemployment fell to 14.7 percent in Spain from 14.8 percent in October. It went down to 10.5 percent in Italy from 10.6 percent. The latest figures available for Greece show an 18.6 percent rate in September.
The rate of jobless in Germany and France, the two largest economies of the euro zone, remained stable at respectively 3.3 percent and 8.9 percent.

In the wider 28-country European Union, unemployment remained stable at 6.7 percent in November, Eurostat estimated.

The ministry agreed the proposed deficit target of 2.8 percent of gross domestic product at its annual work conference in December, two people familiar with the matter said. The figure, which compares with 2018’s target of 2.6 percent, will be presented for approval at the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature, in March. The final number could still change.
While officials have pledged a pro-active fiscal policy this year amid a slowdown in the economy that’s being worsened by the trade war with the U.S., the proposed deficit expansion is smaller than many economists had forecast. At the same time, officials can use so-called special bonds, which don’t affect the overall budget, to finance local government projects and spur infrastructure investment.
The people asked not to be named as the matter isn’t public. The Finance Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment.

The report from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and accountants KPMG report also showed growth in starting salaries for permanent staff slowed for a third month running, although it remained high by historical standards.
""It's no surprise that growth in new permanent jobs dropped to its lowest level in almost two years last month, because economic uncertainty is now affecting companies' hiring plans,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
The terms of Britain's departure from the European Union, scheduled for March 29, remain unclear as legislators are expected next week to vote down the divorce deal that May struck with the EU in November.
Business chiefs and investors fear leaving the EU without a deal would slow trade, spook financial markets and dislocate supply chains for the world's fifth-largest economy.
REC said a shortage of candidates had hampered growth in permanent job placements last month, with some employers saying Brexit uncertainty was making people reluctant to change jobs and discouraging workers from moving to Britain from elsewhere in Europe. 

Almost all the growth in permanent staff placements took place in southern England, especially outside London, with little increase in central or northern areas, REC said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell in November, pulled down by sharp declines in construction and other services, but did little to change views that the economy is facing a shortage of workers.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped by 243,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.9 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, on Tuesday. Despite November's drop, job openings outpaced the number of unemployed people that month by 870,000.
""We see no change in the big picture labor market story from the latest job openings data,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Job openings hit a record high of 7.3 million in August. The decline in job openings in November was led by a 66,000 drop in the other services category. 
Construction vacancies fell 45,000. The decrease in job openings in November was concentrated in the West region.
But there were increases in vacancies in the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector as well as finance and insurance, and education and health services.
The job openings rate slipped to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent in October. Hiring declined 218,000 to 5.7 million in November. The hiring rate fell to 3.8 percent from 4.0 percent in October. 
WORKERS SCARCE
Anecdotal evidence has been growing of companies experiencing difficulties finding workers, a phenomenon that economists expect will slow down job growth this year.
A survey from the NFIB on Tuesday showed the share of small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill surged five points to a record high of 39 percent in December. Most of these vacancies were in manufacturing.
""It won't get easier for small businesses to fill open positions but it's premature to conclude there are significant labor supply issues,"" said Ryan Sweet, as senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 312,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February. Job growth averaged 220,000 per month in 2018. Job gains are expected to slow to around 150,000 per month this year as workers become more scarce.
The JOLTS report also showed the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs falling 112,000 to 3.4 million in November. The quits rate, which policymakers and economists view as a measure of job market confidence, was unchanged at 2.3 percent. 
Some economists said the steady quits rate suggested moderate wage inflation, which could make the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates too high this year. 
The U.S. central bank has forecast two rate hikes this year, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week ""we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.""
""It is just that the labor market is not going into overdrive where it could lead to an overheating economy with labor shortages, sharply higher wages and more inflation, and this will keep the Fed cautious on the need to move interest rates gradually higher this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Layoffs were little changed at 1.8 million in November, holding the layoffs rate at 1.2 percent for a second straight month. 
The Labor Department has not been affected by the partial shutdown of the U.S. government and will continue to publish economic data complied by its statistics agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

Data releases from the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis, including November trade figures, which were scheduled for publication on Tuesday, have been suspended during the shutdown, which started on Dec. 22 amid demands by President Donald Trump for $5 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The gloomier expectations partly reflected declining confidence in industry, which was consistent with the third consecutive monthly fall in November of industrial output in Germany, the largest economy of the 19-country currency bloc.
In a bad sign for the bloc' growth prospects in the last quarter of the year, euro zone economic sentiment eased to 107.3 points in December from 109.5 in November, the European Commission said, marking the indicators' 12th consecutive monthly drop and the lowest level since January 2017.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a less sharp fall to 108.2, but a slide of optimism among industry managers and consumers worsened the picture.
Sentiment in industry fell to 1.1 points from 3.4 in November, against market expectations of a 2.9 point reading.
The mood of consumers also fell sharply to -6.2 points from -3.9 in November, but this did not prevent shoppers from buying more goods, as retail sales kept growing in November, official estimates released on Monday showed.
As a consequence, retail trade confidence went up by 0.5 points in December, although it could not offset the general gloomier mood. 
Sentiment in services, a sector which produces two thirds of the euro zone GDP, went down by 1.4 points.
The worse-than-expected sentiment reading confirms expectations of economists that forecast slowing growth of the euro zone in the last quarter of the year, after GDP growth eased to 0.2 percent in the third quarter from 0.4 percent in the April-June period.

A separate business climate indicator, which helps point to the phase of the business cycle, also decreased in December to 0.82 from 1.04 in November, below expectations of a drop to 0.99.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:20AM ET</span>",German growth worries mount as industrial output plunges,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output unexpectedly fell in November for the third consecutive month, adding to signs that companies in Europe's largest economy are shifting into a lower gear due to mounting risks from abroad.
Trade disputes driven by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies, the threat that Britain will leave the European Union without a deal in March and weaker growth in emerging markets are putting the brakes on a nine-year expansion in Europe's economic powerhouse.
These external shocks and risks are cushioned by a vibrant domestic economy and strong household spending, however, as German consumers benefit from record-high employment, inflation-busting pay hikes, low borrowing costs and some fiscal stimulus.
Industrial output fell by 1.9 percent on the month in November, data released on Tuesday by the Federal Statistics Office showed, coming in way below the 0.3 percent increase that had been forecast. 
The output figure for October was revised down to a fall of 0.8 percent from a previously reported drop of 0.5 percent.
""November's decline in German industrial production adds to the evidence that the euro zone's largest economy grew at a meager pace in Q4,"" Jack Allen of Capital Economics said.
German factories churned out fewer intermediate, capital and consumer goods, according to more detailed data published by the Economy Ministry. Output in the construction industry also decreased, as did production in the energy sector.
SPECIAL FACTORS
The economy ministry pointed to special factors including an unusually high number of bridge days around national holidays and problems faced by the car industry as manufacturers adjust to new emissions standards.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told broadcaster ARD he expected the upswing to continue despite increased headwinds from abroad as the domestic economy is still in good shape and order books are full.
""There are risks that are primarily linked to foreign business and the international arena. It's the trade conflicts, it's Brexit,"" he said.
The industrial output figures followed data on Monday that showed retail sales rose more than expected in November while industrial orders fell in the same month.
Carsten Brzeski of ING Bank said the unexpectedly weak production data had increased the risk of a technical recession after a 0.2 percent contraction in the third quarter.
""On the other hand, private and public consumption still have the potential to offset recession forces,"" Brzeski added.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth data for the fourth quarter and 2018 as a whole on Tuesday next week.
Altmaier last month lowered the government's growth forecast for 2018 to around 1.5 to 1.6 percent, down from the previous estimate of 1.8 percent. For 2019, Berlin predicts a 1.8 percent expansion.
The government hopes tax cuts for middle and high income earners as well as higher child allowances that come into effect in January will further boost consumption, which has replaced exports as the main driver of growth.
Social Democrat Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has rejected calls from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives to abolish the solidarity tax, or 'Soli', for all taxpayers, including the top 10 percent of earners.

In their coalition deal, parties agreed to abolish the Soli income tax surcharge for 90 percent of employees from 2021, which will cost the state some 10 billion euros per year.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 01:22AM ET</span>",More U.S. regions see job openings outnumbering jobless,"By Jason Lange and Ann Saphir
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Job openings are outnumbering unemployed workers across increasingly wide swaths of the United States, forcing businesses to rethink how they find workers, which could keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates despite a global economic slowdown.
The volume of openings first topped the number of jobless people in Midwestern states in early 2017. But in recent months that phenomenon has spread to other regions, particularly the South.
(Graphic - Hard to fill: https://tmsnrt.rs/2SEqoPZ)
The Labor Department on Tuesday is to release the latest data on job openings, from November. The report follows data released last week showing a surge in job growth in December and could help central bankers assess sometimes conflicting anecdotal reports about how hard firms must work to fill jobs.
Economists say the most convincing signs of labor shortages would be a surge in wage growth. While average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent in December, that is tepid by historical standards.
It is possible that the imbalance between job openings and unemployed workers owes partly to the ease with which online job advertisements can be posted. Additionally, it may overstate labor market tightness because people not actively looking for work are not counted in the ranks of the unemployed.
But the combination of increasing job openings and falling unemployment around the country is making a more convincing case of a tighter U.S. labor market.
""If this goes on for another couple of years, then yes of course we'll be running into labor shortages,"" said Ryan Sweet, an economist who tracks regional economies at Moody's Analytics.
In some places, the labor shortages are already here.
Shaw Industries, headquartered in Dalton, Georgia, is growing so quickly that finding good talent ""can be challenging,"" says Brian Cooksey, director of workforce development.
The flooring company, a unit of billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc conglomerate, is funding programs in local high schools and even middle schools to get students interested early in the high-tech manufacturing in which Shaw specializes.
In other places, it is a different story. Last year auto parts supplier Lear Corp held a job fair in Flint, Michigan, to recruit 400 workers for a new factory set to open in April. Some 3,000 people showed up.
""We were totally blown away,"" said Lear CEO Ray Scott.
(Graphic - Openings galore: https://tmsnrt.rs/2SEgMoG)
In October, there were 7.1 million job openings nationwide, about 1 million more than the number of unemployed workers. The spread was widest in the Midwest, where there were 463,000 more openings than jobless workers, and in the South, where the spread was 317,000. The spread was 77,000 in the West and 51,000 in the Northeast.
All four regions have all had a surplus of job openings only since July.
Industry-specific data on openings is not available by region, but the recent surge in the South likely derives from sectors doing well there, like retail and construction, said Sweet.
Strong demand for U.S. factory goods in 2017 likely helped drive job creation in the Midwest, although a global economic slowdown and the China-U.S. trade dispute could hit that region's factories this year, dampening openings.
Fed policymakers say they are nearing the end of a long campaign of gradual interest rate hikes designed to keep the economy from overheating.
Policymakers do not know how much the slowing global economy will undercut a strong U.S. labor market. The jobless rate has trended lower for nearly a decade and while Friday's data showed it ticking higher due to growth in the labor force, it remained near a 49-year low at 3.9 percent.
U.S. central bankers worry a tight labor market will eventually lead to higher inflation. With wage gains still tepid and inflation under the Fed's 2 percent target, the job openings data could add heft to anecdotes detailing labor shortages collected by the Fed in recent months as part of its Beige Book report.
""It certainly reinforces the case for the Fed to try to stop the downward trend in the unemployment rate"" to keep inflation in check, said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 01:03PM ET</span>",U.S. services sector growth hits five-month low,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed to a five-month low in December, but remained above a level consistent with solid economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Monday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 57.6 last month, the lowest reading since July, from 60.7 in November. 
Still the index stayed well above the 50 mark, suggesting expansion of the vast services sector. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 59.0.
Economists said while the drop in the services industries measure echoed recent declines in other business surveys, including the ISM's manufacturing survey published last week, the reading was still strong by historic standards.
""We have seen a range of different indicators lately that point to some softening in the economy as well as rising recession risks, but we think that the economy will continue to expand at a decent pace despite some moderation in growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 2.6 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, pressured by growing expectations the Federal Reserve will either pause or halt its interest rate hike cycle. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
The ISM described growth as having ""cooled,"" noting that trade tensions between the United States and China remained a major concern for businesses. It also said that while capacity constraints had eased, finding workers was still a challenge.
A measure of services industries employment fell to a reading of 56.3 last month, the lowest since July, from 58.4 in November. While industries reported a modest increase in new orders amid strong exports, order backlogs declined sharply.
Companies in the wholesale trade industry said they were anticipating ""a pullback year in demand for 2019,"" citing several factors, including the trade dispute with China, a stock market sell-off, higher mortgage rates as well as labor shortages and higher material costs.
There were concerns in the company management and support services industries about the trade war with China, with companies saying they were expecting ""lower profit margins and reduced sales for 2019 until our suppliers can source product from other countries.""
But retailers described business as being ""very good."" Companies in the real estate, rental and leasing industries reported business as ""exceeding expectations"" and anticipated that ""2019 should equate or exceed 2018."" 
News of the decline in service sector growth followed ISM's data released last week that showed a sharp slowdown in manufacturing activity in December. 
The drop in factory activity and an ebb in consumer confidence had fueled investor fears of a recession. Those fears were allayed on Friday after a government report showed job growth in December was the largest in 10 months.

""We believe this report adds further weight to the case that the economic data have solid momentum and that fears of a sharp slowing in growth are overblown,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index declined to 57.6, the lowest since July and below the median estimate of economists for 58.5, according to a report Monday.

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 57.6 from November’s 60.7, compared to forecast for a more modest decline to 59.6. It was the lowest reading since July 2017.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector, and a reading below signals contraction.
Among the sub-indices, the non-manufacturing business activity index decreased to 59.9 last month, from 65.2 in November.
The new orders index ticked up to 62.7 from 62.5 the previous month.
The employment index fell to 56.3 from 58.4 previously, while the prices index decreased to 57.6 from 64.3 in November.
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector released last Thursday showed that U.S. factory activity slowed sharply to a two-year low in December, suggesting the economy is probably not immune to slowing growth in China and Europe, despite the labor market remaining strong."
391,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>",Euro zone retail sales rise strongly in good news for growth,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone sales rose more than expected in November for a second consecutive month as consumers bought more clothes and electrical goods, official data released on Monday show, in a positive sign for the bloc's growth in the last quarter.
The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, estimated retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro were up 0.6 percent month-on-month, much more than the 0.1 percent rise forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
On the year, retail trade was up by 1.1 percent.
Eurostat also revised upwards October data to a 0.6 percent month-on-month gain from a previous 0.3 percent reading and to a 2.3 percent rise year-on-year from a previous 1.7 percent increase.
The better-than expected figures, although highly volatile and subject to frequent revisions, are positive news for the euro zone economy and could point to stronger growth in the last quarter of the year.
The bloc's economy grew by only 0.2 percent in the third quarter, slowing from a 0.4 percent GDP rise in the second quarter. Before retail figures were released, the gloomier mood among euro zone purchasing managers in December issued on Friday had pushed some economists to forecast that growth in the last quarter of the year would also be slow. 
November retail trade was driven up mostly by consumers' appetite for clothes and footwear, whose sales grew in volume by 2.7 percent on the month. Purchases of electrical goods, such as televisions, were also up by 1.5 percent month-on-month.
The higher retail trade figures were also caused by greater sales of medicines, which increased by 1.3 percent on the month. Sales of automotive fuel and online goods also rose.

The rise in sales in these sectors more than offset a 0.9 percent month-on-month fall in purchases of food, drinks and tobacco.

Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro zone slid to -1.5 from -0.3 in December, falling for the fifth month in a row to hit its lowest level since December 2014. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of -2.8.
A sub-index on expectations fell to -19.3 from -18.8 the previous month. A sub-index on current conditions fell to 18.0 from 20.0.

German industrial orders fell more than expected in November, data showed, adding to a slew of recent indicators showing Germany's exporters are suffering from the trade dispute between China and the United States.
Contracts for goods 'Made in Germany' fell by 1 percent - substantially more than the 0.4 percent slip economists had forecast - after rising by a revised 0.2 percent the previous month, the German statistics office said on Monday.
An uptick of 2.4 percent in domestic orders was unable to offset a 3.2 percent fall in orders from abroad, driven by a particularly stark 11.6 percent drop in eurozone demand.
Coming after German business morale fell in December, the latest data add to signs that the mood in Germany's economy is darkening.
Another survey, released on Friday, showed a drop in both new orders and business confidence slowed growth in Germany's services sector to a 27-month low in December.
German engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) bucked the trend of boardroom caution when it said in November it expects to shrug off global geopolitical tensions and notch up ""moderate"" sales growth during its 2019 fiscal year.
U.S. officials are heading to Beijing this week for the first face-to-face talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping in December agreed to a 90-day truce in the trade war as they sought to strike a deal.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) stood at 51.0 on a seasonally adjusted basis in December, down from 52.3 in November.
That marked the 27th straight month that the index held above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction.
The survey points to ""relatively solid"" growth in the fourth quarter, but the services sector is lagging behind manufacturing, according to Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 52.0 in December from 52.4 in November.
A separate survey on Friday showed Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in December at a better clip than seen in a preliminary poll, as output increased at the fastest pace in eight months.

Japan is scheduled to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October 2019, which is making some policymakers worry about a fall in consumer spending.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 12:14PM ET</span>",Upbeat employment report underscores U.S. economic strength,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired the most workers in 10 months in December while boosting wages, pointing to sustained strength in the economy that could ease fears of a sharp slowdown in growth.
The upbeat employment report from the Labor Department on Friday stood in stark contrast with reports this week showing Chinese factory activity contracting for the first time in 19 months in December and weak manufacturing across much of Europe.
Concerns about the U.S. economy heightened following surveys showing sharp declines in consumer confidence and manufacturing activity last month, which roiled financial markets. Both were seen as more red flags that the economic expansion, now in its ninth year and the second longest on record, is losing steam.
""The jump in payrolls in December would seem to make a mockery of market fears of an impending recession,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""This employment report suggests the U.S. economy still has considerable forward momentum.""
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 312,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February, as employment at construction and leisure and hospitality locations snapped back after being restrained by unseasonably cold temperatures in November. 
Job gains were reported across all industries, with the exception of the information sector, which shed employment for the second straight month. Data for October and November were revised to show 58,000 more jobs added than previously reported. 
The economy created 2.6 million jobs last year compared to 2.2 million in 2017.
Average hourly earnings rose 11 cents, or 0.4 percent, in December after gaining 0.2 percent in November. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 3.2 percent, matching October's rise, which was the largest in 9-1/2 years.
Wages advanced 3.1 percent on a year-on-year basis in November. Employers increased hours for workers, pushing the average workweek up to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in November.
The unemployment rate increased to 3.9 percent from near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent in November as a strong labor market pulled some 419,00 jobless Americans from the sidelines. Fewer workers worked part-time for economic reasons in December. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 63.1 percent, the highest level since September 2017.
The strong employment report likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to continue raising interest rates this year, deepening its rift with Wall Street and President Donald Trump, who has chastised the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, repeatedly for the rate increases.
Speaking at an American Economic Association event with former Fed chiefs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday, Powell sought to placate jittery financial markets. Powell said the U.S. central bank was ""always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly"" if necessary. He also said he would not resign if Trump asked him to so.
The Fed raised rates four times in 2018. The central bank last month forecast two rate hikes this year and signaled its tightening cycle is nearing an end in the face of financial market volatility and slowing global growth. 
U.S. financial markets are projecting no rate hikes in 2019. In the latest signal that investors see little room for the Fed to lift rates any further, yields on 2-year U.S. Treasury notes (US2YT=RR) on Thursday dropped below the Fed's policy rate for the first time in more than a decade.
U.S. stocks rallied on the employment report on Friday and extended gains after Powell's comments. The dollar (DXY) surrendered earlier gains against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields rose.
BROAD EMPLOYMENT GAINS
""This should, at least for today, mute expectations that the Fed is off the table completely this year,"" said Omair Sharif, a senior economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York. 
The December jobs gain pushed total U.S. employment above 150 million jobs for the first time. The Labor Department has not been affected by the partial shutdown of the U.S. government and will continue to publish economic data complied by its statistics agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Data releases from Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis have been suspended during the shutdown, which started on Dec. 22 amid demands by Trump for $5 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
The robust labor market, especially strengthening wage growth, suggests the economy will continue to expand this year despite the ebb in consumer confidence, continued weakness in the housing market and cooling manufacturing activity.
""Strong job gains coupled with rising wages should act as a tailwind for consumption,"" said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York. 
Growth forecasts for the fourth quarter are around a 2.6 percent annualized rate, with risks tilted to the downside amid the fading stimulus from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, a trade war with China and policy uncertainty in Washington. 
The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter. It needs to create roughly 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Job growth averaged 220,000 per month in 2018. It is expected to slow to around 150,000 per month this year as workers become more scarce. 
Anecdotal evidence has been growing of companies experiencing difficulties finding workers, and raising wages to retain and attract employees. The government shutdown, if it extends beyond next week, could weigh on January payrolls.
Employment at construction sites rebounded last month, with companies hiring 38,000 employees after adding no workers in November. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 32,000 jobs in December. Retailers hired 23,800 more workers. 
Professional and business services employment increased by 43,000 jobs last month and government payrolls rose 11,000. Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 55,000 jobs. The health and education sector added 82,000 positions.

396,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Jobs Report Gives Green Light to Fed Rate Hikes,"Investing.com - The December employment report showed renewed strength in the U.S. labor market, supporting the Federal Reserve's notion that rate hikes could still be needed this year.
The economy created 312,000 new jobs at the end of 2018, with the majority - 301,000 - occurring in the private sector, while wage inflation ticked higher, supporting Fed concerns about prices creeping higher on the back of a tight labor market.
Stocks zig-zagged after the report, with S&P 500 futures up just a tad from their pre-report gains after the dust settled. The 10-year Treasury yield added to gains after the numbers were released.
Investors will now be weighing the strong payrolls gains, which counter concerns about a significant slowdown, with wage inflation ticking higher, underlining the case for further rate hikes 2019.
The only negative in the report was an unexpected increase in the unemployment rate to 3.9%. But the downbeat first impression can be explained by the increase in the participation rate, which hit its highest level since 2014. With more people actively looking for work in a strong economy, the jobless rate ticked higher.
Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian classified the report as “A Fed ‘told you so’”.
“With the exception of higher labor participation which supports the notion of some remaining slack in the labor market, this strong December jobs report will be seen in my opinion by central bankers as supporting more rate hikes and no tweaks to the balance sheet policy,” he said.
The Fed predicted two further rate increases during 2019 when it hiked by a quarter point at its last policy meeting in December.
Markets have remained skeptical, going so far as to suggest that the U.S. central bank would need to cut rates in the face of a global slowdown reinforced by recent weak data from China and the uncertainty surrounding the U.S.-Sino trade dispute.
In a notable comparison, fed fund futures had priced in the possibility of a rate cut in June of this year at around 18%, with those odds dropping to just 6% following the release. And a slight chance of a rate hike in June reappeared after the jobs numbers were released."

(Reuters) - Europe's top economies ended 2018 weaker than they started it, with business surveys pointing to slower growth and concerns about both the U.S.-China trade war as well as Britain's imminent departure from the European Union. 
Key purchasing managers' indexes from across the euro zone suggest momentum was still slipping away in December, when the European Central Bank took a long-awaited decision to shutter its 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program.
In Britain, where activity was a bit more resilient three months before it is due to leave the EU, business expectations for the year ahead wilted.
With turmoil in financial markets, and serious signs that manufacturing activity in the U.S. as well as China slowed sharply at the end of 2018, the data on Friday was the latest to suggest the global economy is struggling.
""If you're looking at exports in terms of GDP, actually the euro zone is the most exposed to the external economy. Even the fact that there is some slowdown, it remains quite muted in the U.S. But in China, the slowdown seems to be more severe,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING.
""This is having a big impact on European exports, something that will unfortunately continue for some months to come, given the fact that we don't expect there will be a very rapid upturn in U.S. and China.""
The Final Euro Zone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December, a good guide to overall private sector growth, slipped to 51.1, the lowest in more than four years, from 52.7 in November. That was also down from a flash reading of 51.3.
The euro zone services PMI also fell to a four-year low of 51.2 from 53.4, hurt by slower new business growth.
Services and Composite PMIs for the two largest euro zone economies, Germany and France, also declined in December, coming below all forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
And the Italy PMI suggested its services industry was barely growing after its economy contracted in the third quarter. 
An already-deteriorating outlook for the euro zone economy dimmed further, too. The composite future output PMI also fell to a more than four-year low.
That suggests the euro zone economy, which grew just 0.2 percent in the third quarter of 2018, its weakest pace in four years, may slow even further in coming months.
""The data are consistent with euro zone GDP rising by just under 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, but with quarterly growth momentum slowing to 0.15 percent in December,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
In Britain, business conditions were not much better. 
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose slightly more than the median forecast by economists polled by Reuters, to 51.2 in December from 50.4 in November.
But that was one of the weakest since the Brexit referendum in 2016 and, crucially, firms were increasingly anxious about the year ahead. 
November and December marked the weakest two months for morale among services firms since March 2009, around the low point of Britain's last recession. Services account for about 80 percent of British economic output. 
""Brexit was once again by far the most commonly cited cause of concern about the year ahead,"" said IHS Markit's Williamson.
""The current low level of the PMI would normally be sufficiently weak to have triggered a cut in interest rates or other stimulus from the Bank of England in order to revive demand and avoid further downward pressure on future prices.""

Britain's economy was on track for quarterly growth of around 0.1 percent during the fourth quarter, according to IHS Markit, well below the post-financial crisis average of 0.5 percent.

That will be disappointing news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who ended their 2.6 trillion euro ($2.95 trillion) asset purchase program - one of the main sources of stimulus for the bloc's economy - last month.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, held above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
But it fell to 51.1 from November's 52.7, also below a flash reading of 51.3.
The outlook dimmed as the composite future output PMI fell to a more than four-year low of 59.1 from 59.5.
That suggests the euro zone economy, which grew 0.2 percent - its weakest pace in four years - in the third quarter of 2018, is likely to slow further this year.
""The data are consistent with euro zone GDP rising by just under 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, but with quarterly growth momentum slowing to 0.15 percent in December,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
A Reuters poll published as recently as Dec. 10 showed growth was expected to jump back up to 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
Momentum was also lost in euro zone manufacturing during 2018, in line with trends elsewhere, according to a corresponding PMI survey on Wednesday.
The services PMI fell to a four-year low of 51.2 from 53.4, hurt by slower growth of new business.
An index measuring overall new work for services firms fell to 51.5 from 53.4, its lowest since December 2014.
That was hurt by new export orders contracting for a fourth straight month to the lowest since records began for that sub-index in September 2014.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation eases off ECB target, may complicate rate hike plan","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation slowed in December more than markets had forecast and moved away from the European Central Bank target, a preliminary estimate showed on Friday, strengthening predictions that a hike in interest rates may not come this year.
The European Union's statistics agency Eurostat estimated that prices in the 19-country currency bloc rose 1.6 percent in December on the year, slowing from 1.9 percent in November. 
Inflation was held back by a sharp slowdown in energy prices, while core indicators remained stable at low levels.
The easing was larger than expected by a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a 1.8 percent inflation in December. 
The unexpected fall brings inflation below the European Central Bank target of a rate below, but close to 2.0 percent, complicating plans for a possible hike in interest rates.
The ECB promised in December to keep rates at current record lows at least through next summer and made no attempt to change market expectations that a first post-crisis interest rate rise will come only in early 2020.
The December figures strengthened the view that no hike should be expected this year.
""With inflation moving away from the target and an economy that is slowing, the question is whether the ECB will see a chance to hike at all this year,"" Bert Colijn, economist at ING bank said. 
The ECB forecast inflation at 1.8 percent in 2018 and at 1.6 percent this year, but some economists were less optimistic.
""Inflation is clearly below 2 percent, the ECB is in no hurry to lift rates any time soon,"" Marc Brutsch, economist at Swiss Life insurer said, predicting a 1.7 percent rate in 2018 and a drop to 1.4 percent this year. 
In a remark that seems to confirm economists' expectations, ECB policymaker Benoit Coeure said on Friday that interest rates were set to remain at low levels as long as needed to bring inflation back to its target.
Inflation slowed mostly because of easing energy prices which rose 5.5 percent year-on-year in December after a 9.1 percent rise in November. 
The core indicator watched closely by the ECB for its monetary policy decisions, which excludes volatile energy and food prices was stable at 1.1 percent in December, and in line with market expectations.
A narrower indicator that excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco was also stable at 1.0 percent, matching forecasts.
Bond yields across the bloc rose after Friday's inflation estimates. German 10-year yields hit a session high at 0.189 percent, up more than 3 basis points on the day (DE10YT=RR).
""While the recent pick-up in wage growth may well push the core rate up a little this year, as energy inflation looks set to keep falling sharply, headline inflation will probably drop to about 1 percent by the middle of the year,"" Jack Allen, economist at Capital Economics said.
Eurostat's flash estimate does not include a monthly calculation.
In a separate release, Eurostat said industrial producer prices dropped in November by 0.3 percent in the euro zone on the month, more than the 0.2 percent fall forecast by economists polled by Reuters. 
The drop followed a 0.8 percent increase of prices in October.

On the year, prices went up by 4.0 percent in the euro zone in November, Eurostat said.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by 184,000 in December, according to the median of estimates in Bloomberg’s survey of economists before the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report Friday at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. That would be up from 155,000 jobs added in November yet shy of the 206,000 average pace in the first 11 months of the year.
The labor market, however, is unlikely to perform as well this year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect job gains to slow to an average monthly pace of 156,000. That would amount to 1.87 million for 2019, less than the 2.27 million added in the first 11 months of 2018.
The jobless rate held in December at 3.7 percent, a 49-year low, as annual wage gains eased to 3 percent from a post-recession high of 3.1 percent, forecasts show.

Research firm IHS Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 51.2 in December, compared to forecasts for a reading of 50.7.
That was higher than November’s reading of 50.4.
“The service sector typically plays a major role in driving economic growth, but is now showing worrying signs of having lost steam amid intensifying Brexit anxiety. The final two months of 2018 saw the weakest back-to-back expansions of business activity since late-2012 and highlight how clarity on Brexit is needed urgently in order to prevent the economy sliding into contraction,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
He noted that the survey, combined with weak activity in construction and manufacturing, pointed to fourth quarter growth of just 0.1%.
“Although increased preparations for a potentially disruptive ‘no deal’ Brexit are helping to boost business activity in some cases, notably in manufacturing, heightened Brexit uncertainty is compounding a broader economic slowdown,” Williamson concluded."

The Federal Labor Office said the seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 14,000 to 2.261 million. That was more than the forecast drop of 11,000.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers index for services plunged in December to 49.0 from 55.1 in November, worse than a preliminary reading of 49.6.
The index dropped through the 50-point threshold dividing expansion from contraction, to its lowest level since November 2014.
The weakness in France's dominant service sector weighed on overall business activity, with IHS Markit's overall PMI index also dropping more than flagged in a preliminary reading.
The overall PMI index, which includes services and already published figures for manufacturing, fell to 48.7 from 54.2 in November, worse than the 49.3 originally reported.
France has witnessed some of the worst street violence in decades during grassroots protests that initially targeted fuel hikes in mid-November, causing some business to board up windows during the peak pre-Christmas holiday season.
Named after the yellow high-visibility vests French drivers are required to keep in their cars, the 'gilets jaunes' protests have snowballed into a broader anti-government movement against the high cost of living and President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business reform drive.
""The protests added to the growing list of problems faced by Emmanuel Macron,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said. ""The unexpected downturn due to the social unrest represents significant downside risk to Q4 growth prospects.""

House prices fell by 0.7 percent from November, the biggest monthly fall since July 2012, Friday's data showed.
Compared with a year earlier, prices rose by just 0.5 percent compared with a 1.9 percent rise in November.
Both readings were below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Nationwide said it expected prices to rise at a ""low single-digit pace"" in 2019 but its forecast was dependent on the economy continuing to grow modestly, something that looked ""unusually uncertain.""
Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to overcome deep opposition in her own Conservative Party to the Brexit divorce deal she agreed with other European Union leaders, raising the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal departure from the EU in March.
Britain's housing market has weakened since the June 2016 Brexit vote, led by price falls in London.
At the time of the referendum, Nationwide's measure of house prices was rising by about 5 percent a year.

The retail vacancy rate rose to 10.2 percent from 10.0 percent a year earlier, the report said.
Many feared that vacancy rates would soar and rents would plummet, given the store closure announcements by Sears Holdings Corp, Kmart and JC Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) at the end of 2017, Reis said.
""This did not occur as the doomsday prognostications proved to be overblown,"" the report said.
A number of stores are still expected to close in the coming months and the industry continues to face a number of headwinds, including gains in online shopping, according to Reis.
""If the retail sector was able to sustain the store closures over the last year, it can survive anything,"" the research firm said.
Both the mall sector and the neighborhood and community shopping center sectors have seen significant volatility over the last year. The mall vacancy rate rose to 9.0 percent from 8.3 percent.
Net absorption was 1.4 million sq ft in the quarter, compared with 3.6 million sq ft a year earlier.
The national average asking rents, as well as the effective rent rose 1.6 percent.
Only 1.9 million sq ft of new construction was completed in the quarter, a 51.9 percent drop, according to the report. Vacancy rose in 32 of 77 metros.

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to a six-month high of 53.9 in December, up from 53.8 in the previous month and well above the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction.
It had slipped to a 13-month low in October. 
New export business rose at the fastest rate in six months as firms stepped up efforts to attract orders from overseas. Total new order growth eased slightly, however, pointing to softening domestic demand. 
Continued resilience in the services sector, which accounts for more than half of China's economy, could partly offset pressure from a manufacturing slowdown, a cooling real estate market and trade frictions with the United States.
But official data suggest consumer demand and confidence have been faltering recently as the economic outlook grows more cloudy.
""As the economy slows, all sectors would be affected including the services sector,"" said Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management.
Indeed, the business survey showed job creation in the sector eased to only a marginal pace as business confidence remained subdued. 
Analysts at Chinese investment bank CICC said in a note on Thursday predict that employment pressure will likely be seen on many fronts this year, including in the industrial, construction, and services sectors.
The latest survey also showed operating expenses rose to a three-month high in December, with firms citing rising raw material prices and higher salary costs. Companies were able to raise their prices to customers only marginally in response, suggesting greater pressure on profit margins.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Friday, rose to 52.2 in December from 51.9 in November. 
However, total new orders slowed in December while the employment gauge shrank further into negative territory, implying increasing challenges to stabilizing employment, according to Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group.
In a key economic meeting in December, the country's top leaders said they would prioritize employment in economic policies, according to Xinhua.

Economic conditions in China are widely expected to get worse before they get better, as a raft of growth boosting measures in recent months will take some time to be felt.

The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 28th consecutive month.
The final index for output was 54.0, above a preliminary 53.7 and higher than the 52.4 reading for November. 
December's final index for export orders was revised up to 49.1 from a preliminary 48.0, but a significant drop from November's 50.8 and the largest contraction for a month since June. Overseas demand remains a concern amid trade friction between the United States and China.
""The final print of the December manufacturing PMI showed that Japan's goods-producing economy looks set to contribute to a bounce-back in gross domestic growth for Q4,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Nonetheless, the survey data provide reason to remain cautious on growth prospects,"" he said, citing the contraction in export orders.
The revised survey also showed that business optimism weakened for a seventh consecutive month, suggesting that risks posed by trade protectionism and a slowdown in overseas economies are weighing on corporate sentiment.

Tokyo will begin its own free trade talks with the United States sometime in 2019, which could pose another risk to Japan's export-focused economy.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>","U.S. factory activity hits two-year low, casts shadow over economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed sharply to a two-year low in December amid a plunge in new orders and hiring at factories, suggesting the economy was probably not immune to slowing growth in China and Europe. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey published on Thursday offered a downbeat assessment of the manufacturing sector, with almost all components declining last month. Concerns about the economy's health are escalating despite the labor market remaining strong.
""The economy is just going to be spinning its wheels with subpar growth in 2019 if the purchasing managers report is to be believed,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""New orders have dried up and this will take a toll on business investment and growth in 2019.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity tumbled 5.2 points to 54.1 last month, the lowest reading since November 2016. 
The drop was the largest since October 2008, when the economy was in the throes of a recession. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The ISM said that demand had ""softened."" It said while consumption continued to strengthen, with production and employment still expanding, this was ""at much lower levels compared to prior periods."" 
The ISM's new orders sub-index plunged 11 points to 51.1 last month, the lowest reading since August 2016. The survey's factory employment measure dropped to 56.2 in December from 58.4 in the prior month.
Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on steel and aluminum imports as well as a range of Chinese goods are hurting manufacturers. Transportation equipment manufacturers said ""customer demand continues to decrease due to concerns about the economy and tariffs.""
Machinery makers complained that ""the ongoing open issues with tariffs between U.S. and China are causing longer-term concerns about costs and sourcing strategies for our manufacturing operations."" Computer and electronic product manufacturers said ""growth appears to have stopped.""
President Donald Trump has defended the duties as necessary to protect American industries from what he says is unfair foreign competition. The White House's protectionism has lead to a trade war with China and tit-for-tat tariffs with other trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
In addition to the tariffs, which have raised input costs for manufacturers, factory activity is also being undercut by a strong dollar, a shortage of skilled workers, a fading fiscal stimulus and slowing growth in economies like China.
Data this week showed factory activity weakened across much of Europe and Asia in December, with Chinese manufacturing contracting for the first time in 19 months. Apple (O:AAPL) on Wednesday cut its sales forecast for its quarter ending in December, citing slowing iPhone sales in China.
U.S. stocks extended losses on the weak ISM survey, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) falling more than 600 points at one point. The dollar dropped against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell.
SLOWING ECONOMY
The sharp stock market sell-off has raised the specter of a significant slowdown in growth this year, though economists see no recession. Some economists believe that the resulting tightening in financial market conditions could discourage the Federal Reserve from further raising interest rates this year.
The Fed increased borrowing costs last month for the fourth time in 2018, but forecast fewer rate hikes this year and signaled its tightening cycle is nearing an end in the face of financial market volatility and slowing global growth.
Despite signs of slowing economic growth, the labor market appears strong. The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Thursday showed private payrolls jumped 271,000 last month after increasing 157,000 in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 178,000 last month. The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for December scheduled for release on Friday.
The ADP report has a spotty record predicting the private-payrolls component of the government's employment report and last month's surge probably exaggerates the strength of the labor market because of a seasonal quirk. 
""The ADP employment report has been susceptible to large swings in December that we think may be in part due to a year-end quirk that has tended to result in ADP printing high relative to payrolls in the final month of the year,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Still, other labor market indicators were strong in December, including consumers' perceptions of the job market.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 177,000 jobs last month after rising 155,000 in November. The unemployment rate is forecast steady near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent.
With the labor market viewed at being at or beyond full employment, the pace of job growth is slowing as employers struggle to find workers. Some of the moderation in employment gains has been attributed to the stock market rout.
A third report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ended Dec. 29. Claims have now increased for three straight weeks. 
Claims data tends to be noisy around year-end holidays. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 218,750 last week.

""The claims data suggest that conditions in the labor market have softened relative to a few months ago when the claims readings were very upbeat, but the extent of any deterioration is not entirely obvious and does not look extreme at this point,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Growth in the euro zone and much of the world is losing steam, dragged by slower demand from China and increased trade frictions between Beijing and Washington.
But euro zone lending data, which tends to lag by roughly a year a forward-looking indicator of economic activity such as the survey of company managers, still painted a bright picture. 
Corporate loans grew by 4 percent year-on-year while credit to households rose by 3.3 percent - in each case 10 basis points faster than in October, the data showed. 
The latter marked the highest growth rate since 2009, extending a multi-year recovery fuelled by the ECB's ultra-easy policy of massive bond purchases and ultra-cheap funding for banks.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.8 from 53.4 in November, broadly in line with the consensus expectation of 52.9 in a Reuters poll of economists.
The fastest upturn in civil engineering activity since May 2017 was not enough to counter a slowdown in housebuilding and commercial construction, the survey showed.
""Subdued domestic economic conditions and an intense headwind from political uncertainty resulted in the weakest upturn in commercial work for seven months,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Still, optimism in the construction industry, which accounts for around 7 percent of British economic output, rose to an eight-month high in December, contrasting with falling confidence in other sectors before Britain leaves the European Union in less than three months' time.
""Levels of optimism remained subdued in relation to those recorded by the survey over much of the past six years, largely reflecting concerns that Brexit uncertainty will continue to encourage delays with decision-making,"" Moore said.
Businesses in the much larger services sector reported the slowest sales growth in two years during the final three months of 2018, another sign of a slowing economy ahead of Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce reported earlier on Thursday.

416,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 04:38AM ET</span>",UK Construction PMI Falls in December as Brexit Uncertainty Weighs,"Investing.com - Activity in the UK construction sector slowed last month as political uncertainty from Brexit weighed, according to a closely watched business survey released on Thursday.
Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.8 in December, compared to forecasts for a reading of 52.9.
The prior month’s reading was 53.4.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.“UK construction firms signaled a slowdown in housing and commercial activity growth during December, which more than offset a strong performance for civil engineering at the end of 2018. Subdued domestic economic conditions and an intense headwind from political uncertainty resulted in the weakest upturn in commercial work for seven months,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
Moore noted that a boost in transport and energy projects helped push business optimism to an eight-month high in December, but was cautious as the UK’s departure from the European Union in March looms closer.
“Levels of optimism remained subdued in relation to those recorded by the survey over much of the past six years, largely reflecting concerns that Brexit uncertainty will continue to encourage delays with decision-making, especially on commercial projects,"" Moore concluded."

LONDON (Reuters) - Businesses in Britain's dominant services sector reported the slowest sales growth in two years during the final three months of 2018, another sign of a slowing economy ahead of Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Thursday.
Many retailers had reported difficulties in the run-up to Christmas, but Thursday's findings -- from Britain's largest private-sector economic survey -- point to a broader slowdown among businesses that rely on consumer spending.
Manufacturers also reported weaker sales growth, and orders slowed across the board befoe Britain's planned departure from the European Union on March 29.
""The UK economy is in stasis,"" BCC director general Adam Marshall said. ""With little clarity on the trading conditions they'll face in just two months' time, companies are understandably holding back on spending and making big decisions about their futures.""
The Bank of England estimates overall economic growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the final quarter of 2018 from 0.6 percent in the three months before.
Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to overcome deep opposition to her Brexit plan in her own Conservative Party, raising the risk that no transition period will be provided to ease Britain out of its four-decade-long membership of the EU.
The BCC's survey of more than 6,000 businesses was carried out from Nov. 5 to Nov. 26, before a lack of parliamentary support forced May to postpone a vote on her Brexit deal.
On Wednesday, a survey of manufacturing purchasing managers showed an unexpected pick-up in growth, but it was driven primarily by businesses seeking to stockpile goods in case of border delays following a possible no-deal Brexit in March.
Despite Brexit worries, most businesses in the BCC survey said they were finding it hard to recruit staff. Manufacturers reported the joint-greatest recruitment difficulties since the survey started in 1989, and the situation for services businesses eased only slightly from a record high in the third-quarter survey.
The BCC again urged the government to limit the scale of likely post-Brexit restrictions on immigration, after a public body advised politicians last month to bar most foreign workers earning under 30,000 pounds ($38,000) a year.
""Companies must be able to access skills at all levels without heavy costs or bureaucracy,"" Marshall said.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 06:17PM ET</span>","Global growth worries, higher oil flatten yield curve","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yields on long-dated U.S. Treasury securities fell to their lowest in nearly a year on Wednesday on concerns about the health of the global economy, a worry exacerbated late in the day when Apple Inc (O:AAPL) cut its sales outlook and sent U.S. equity index futures tumbling.
Throughout the first trading day of 2019 investors piled into safe-haven investments like longer-dated Treasuries and German bunds after weak data out of China and Europe was reported overnight and a partial shutdown of the U.S. government continued. 
Yields on benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) fell to their lowest since late last January. They hit a fresh 11-month low near 2.62 percent late in the day when Apple announced sales would fall well short of previous forecasts largely because of a slowdown in demand for its iPhones in China.
China's economy was already of central concern after a measure of its manufacturing activity shrank for the first time in 19 months in December, hit by the Chinese-U.S. trade war, with the weakness spilling over to other Asian economies.
""Chinese PMI came in weaker than expected and gave a risk-off tone to global markets. There are now mounting concerns about global growth,"" said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
The 10-year note yield was last at 2.63 percent, breaching the key technical level of 2.64 percent. Ten-year yields fell nearly 6 basis points on the day, their largest one-day fall in a month.
Other safe-haven investments also benefited in price from the flight to quality. The benchmark 10-year German government bond yield (DE10YT=RR) was down 7 basis points, last at 0.17 percent. 
While U.S. stocks eked out modest gains on Wednesday to start the new year, after their poorest yearly showing in a decade in 2018, Apple's weak sales forecast after Wall Street closed sent equity index futures sharply lower, bringing in further support for Treasuries.
The grim readings from Asia's and Europe's purchasing manager surveys came ahead of the closely watched U.S. manufacturing survey on Thursday, payrolls data on Friday and the U.S. earnings season later this month, which is expected to show corporate profit shrank in the October-December quarter.
Oil prices rose about 4 percent in choppy trading on Wednesday, supported by gains in U.S. equity markets, but concerns remained about rising crude production and weakening global economic growth.
The yield on the two-year Treasury note (US2YT=RR) was supported by the rise in oil prices, last up about half a basis point to 2.504 percent. With the sharp drop in long-dated yields the yield curve flattened to a spread of 15.2 basis points between the two- and 10-year note yields .

A section of the yield curve sank deeper into inversion, with the yield on 1-year bills (US1YT=RR) now exceeding those on all securities through the 7-year maturity (US7YT=RR).

419,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Mexico factory activity in negative territory for second straight month,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's manufacturing sector contracted for the second month running in December, dragged down by declining business sentiment, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index  registered a reading of 49.7 in December, the same level as a month earlier.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below points to contraction.
Mexico's new president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office on Dec. 1. Mexican financial markets have been rattled amid concerns about how the leftist leader could shift economic policy in Latin America's No. 2 economy.
The December and November figures were the lowest readings since October 2017, and the first time there were two consecutive months of contraction in the current series, which dates to April 2011.
""The Mexican manufacturing sector showed little signs of shaking off its fragility in December, posting back-to-back modest contractions in production,"" said IHS Markit economist Pollyanna De Lima.
""Data suggested that the domestic and international markets were sources of weakness, reflecting the wider sluggish performance of the Mexican economy and relatively low sales to the US.""
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports, which are mostly manufactured goods like cars and televisions, to the United States.

The PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, fell to a seasonally adjusted 53.6 last month, its lowest since January 2017, from 54.9 in November.
A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""December data signaled a loss of momentum for manufacturers at the end of the year, with stagnating export sales and softer energy sector demand the key factors behind an overall slowdown in production growth,"" said Christian Buhagiar, president and CEO, Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA).
The output index fell to a 2-year low of 52.0 from 53.4 in November. Manufacturers reported that global trade frictions had held back export sales, IHS Markit said.
The new export orders index fell to 49.9, its lowest since November 2017, from 53.2 in November, while the employment index pulled back to 55.2 from a survey-record high of 57.1 in November.

There was evidence that less upbeat projections for output growth had slowed hiring at some firms, IHS Markit said. The measure of future output fell to 62.4, its lowest since February 2016, from 63.9.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 08:56AM ET</span>",U.S.-China trade war takes toll on global manufacturing,"By Jonathan Cable and Marius Zaharia
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factory activity weakened across much of Europe and Asia in December as the U.S.-China trade war and a slowdown in demand hit production in many economies, offering little reason for optimism as the new year begins.
A series of purchasing managers' indexes for December released on Wednesday mostly showed declines or slowdowns in manufacturing activity across the globe. 
In China, the Caixin/IHS Markit PMI slipped into contraction territory for the first time in 19 months, broadly tracking an official survey released on Monday.
""We are really seeing a global slowdown into this year, and in Asia, particularly, export-oriented countries are hurting,"" said Irene Cheung, Asia strategist at ANZ.
""Our expectation for central banks is that most of them won't change policy in 2019 and these numbers coming out on the weak side won't change that outlook.""
Euro zone manufacturing activity barely expanded at the end of 2018, providing disappointing reading for European Central Bank policymakers, just after they ended their 2.6 trillion-euro asset-purchase scheme.
Earlier PMI surveys showed Italy remained in contraction territory and was joined by France, where data showed a first deterioration in operating conditions for 27 months.
Manufacturing growth in both Germany and Spain was modest, easing to the weakest in around two-and-a-half years.
British factories, however, ramped up stockpiling as they prepared for possible border delays when Britain leaves the European Union in less than three months' time.
The UK manufacturing PMI rose to a six-month high, stronger than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Survey compiler IHS Markit cautioned the improvement did not herald a big change in the outlook for Britain's stuttering economy -- it was caused in large part by manufacturers stockpiling inputs and finished goods. 
""Despite the headline index rising to a six-month high in December, the manufacturing PMI still suggests that the sector stagnated in Q4,"" said Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics.
Later on Wednesday, surveys are expected to show U.S. activity was a tad slower, but still expanding, in a sign China has suffered more from trade frictions than the United States.
But world shares started 2019 on a downbeat note, oil prices and bond yields slid, and the Japanese yen strengthened on Wednesday as the factory survey data confirmed the picture of a global economic slowdown. 
CHINA BRAKES
China's weakness spilled over to other Asian economies. Malaysian manufacturing slowed to its weakest pace of expansion since the survey began in 2012, and Taiwan fell to its lowest since September 2015.
Meanwhile, official economic data out of Singapore showed its gross domestic product grew more slowly than forecast in the fourth quarter as the city-state's manufacturing contracted on a quarterly basis.
With growth slowing and inflation below or barely within target in most countries, Asian central banks are unlikely to continue their tightening cycle this year, barring any shocks in currency markets.

The world's two largest economies agreed at the start of December to a 90-day truce following tit-for-tat tariffs that have disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods between the two countries.
Tariffs are not the only drag on China's economy. Beijing's sustained drive to reduce debt risks in the economy has cooled the property market and curbed credit flows to the private sector. Meanwhile, the government's intensified crackdown on pollution has dented industrial activity.
In a key annual conference last month, China's top leaders said they would boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and keeping liquidity ample, while promising to continue negotiations with Washington.
China's economic growth slowed to 6.5 percent in the third quarter of last year, the weakest since the global financial crisis. Reuters reported government advisers had recommended a growth target of 6.0 to 6.5 percent for this year at the annual meeting, though the final figure won't be made public until parliament's annual meeting in early March.
A drop in crude-oil prices (LCOc1) at the end of last year has helped sentiment in Asia's oil-importing economies, where trade deficits are a key vulnerability.
Indonesia's PMI, although still weak historically, rose. India's declined but capped the strongest quarter for the country's manufacturing since late 2012. But Malaysia, which relies heavily on oil revenues, saw its weakest reading ever.

Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily focused on tech production, also saw activity shrink. The U.S.-China trade war affects chip orders and coincides with a slowdown in demand for smart phones globally.

""The trend of economic slowdown still continues, and the slowing momentum is increasing. The fourth quarter GDP growth is very possible to be lower than 6.5 percent,"" said China Finance magazine, which is published by the People's Bank of China.
The government should step up tax cuts to help ease the burden on companies, especially small firms, the magazine said.
""The phenomenon of closures and layoffs is very common and employees' income growth has been greatly restricted,"" it said.
Chinese leaders have pledged to ratchet up support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and keeping ample liquidity amid a trade dispute with the United States.
China's economic growth slowed to 6.5 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis. Indications are that momentum is likely to come off further in the fourth quarter and next year.

Chinese officials have said the economy would still hit the official growth target of around 6.5 percent in 2018.

Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.2 in December, compared to forecasts for a reading of 52.6.
The prior month’s reading was 53.6.
“December saw the UK PMI rise to a six-month high, following short-term boosts to inventory holdings and inflows of new business as companies stepped up their preparations for a potentially disruptive Brexit,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
“Uncertainties regarding Brexit disruption on supply chains and the exchange rate are also weighing on business confidence (…) Manufacturing will therefore be entering 2019 on a less than ideal footing with Brexit uncertainty having intensified considerably ,” he concluded."
424,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",German manufacturing growth slows again in December: PMI,"BERLIN, (Reuters) - Growth in Germany's manufacturing sector slowed again in December as new orders fell at the fastest rate in four years, a survey showed on Wednesday.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, fell to a 33-month low of 51.5 from 51.8 in November, edging closer to the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction.
It was the 11th time in 2018 that the manufacturing index fell, reflecting a sustained cooling of growth in Europe's largest economy, which shrank in the third quarter partly on one-off effects such as fewer car registrations as makers adapt to new pollution standards.
Germany is also facing headwinds from trade frictions between the United States and China and weaker demand from the euro zone.
""With things having got a little too hot at the end of 2017 a correction was inevitable, but the extent of the slowdown has been somewhat a surprise,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""The darkening global economic picture has had ramifications for Germany's outwardly focused manufacturing sector over the course of 2018, while the sequence of headwinds in the car industry in the latter stages of the year has been a further restricting factor,"" said Smith.
He added that manufacturers were able to sustain output growth thanks to back orders.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity barely expanded at the end of 2018 in a broad-based slowdown, according to a survey which showed scant signs for optimism as the new year begins.
The disappointing survey comes just after the European Central Bank ended its 2.6 trillion euro asset purchasing scheme and is likely to make uncomfortable reading for policymakers.
IHS Markit's December final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a fifth month, coming in at 51.4 from November's 51.8, matching a flash reading but barely above the 50 level separating growth from contraction.
That was its lowest reading since February 2016 but an index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, nudged up to 51.0 from 50.7.
""A disappointing December rounds off a year in which a manufacturing boom faded away to near-stagnation,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The weakness of the recent survey data in fact raises the possibility that the goods producing sector could even act as a drag on the overall economy in the fourth quarter, representing a marked contrast to the growth surge seen this time last year.""
Findings in a December Reuters poll suggested the chances of a recession this year, while still low, have crept up to 20 percent from 15 percent previously. 
Earlier PMI surveys showed Italy remained in contraction territory and was joined by France, where data showed a first deterioration in operating conditions for 27 months.
Manufacturing growth in both Germany and Spain was modest, easing in both to the weakest in around two-and-a-half years.
Suggesting little hope for January, new orders across the bloc fell at their sharpest rate in over four years in December, backlogs were run down for a fourth month and hiring remained modest.
This meant firms were at their least optimistic in six years. The future output index dropped to 56.0 from 56.3.

""Continued worries over global trade, ongoing political uncertainties and tightening financial conditions all served to undermine confidence during December,"" Williamson said.

Ireland's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index was 54.5 in December, down from 55.4 in November and the lowest level in nine months. 
The Irish economy was the best performer in the European Union in 2018 for the fifth year in a row, but it is vulnerable to the threat of an unruly exit by Britain from the EU.
The last time the index was below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction was May 2013.
Underpinning the drop in the headline index was a slowdown in new-order growth among Irish manufacturers to the weakest point in eight months.
The sub-index measuring new orders dropped to 55.1 in December from 57.3 in November.
""Irish manufacturers experienced a slowdown in growth in December, with PMI data indicating weaker rises in output, new orders and employment,"" said Amritpal Virdee, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the Ireland manufacturing survey.
""While some firms saw signs of weaker demand, panellists are confident of a pick-up in the new year, supporting strong growth of purchasing activity and stockbuilding.""

The Caixin Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.7 from 50.2, marking the first contraction since May 2017. That compared to the consensus of a marginal dip from November to 50.1.
A reading below 50 signals contraction.
The reading confirmed a trend seen in the official PMI that was reported on Monday, which showed a drop to 49.4 in December.
The Caixin/Markit survey focuses mostly on smaller businesses, filling a niche that isn't covered by the official data.
The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China continued to affect demand across Asia’s manufacturing hubs, analysts said.
""External demand remained subdued due to the trade frictions between China and the U.S., while domestic demand weakened more notably,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
""It is looking increasingly likely that the Chinese economy may come under greater downward pressure,"" said Zhong.

In China, the Caixin Media and IHS Markit PMI fell to 49.7 from 50.2, its lowest reading since May 2017. That confirms a trend seen in the official PMI on Monday, which showed a drop to 49.4 in December, the weakest since early 2016. A reading below 50 signals contraction.
Asian stocks fell and U.S. futures and oil pared gains. The steepest declines were in Hong Kong and China, while shares also fell in Australia and South Korea.
Taiwan’s Nikkei and IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 47.7 in December from 48.4 in November, down from 56.6 a year earlier. That’s partly due to a fall in demand for machinery and electronics goods, along with information and communications equipment, amid slowing orders for new smartphones and the simmering trade war.
Malaysia’s PMI fell to 46.8 from 48.2, its lowest reading since the series began. New orders were at their weakest since May. South Korea’s PMI remained in contractionary territory for the second consecutive month even as the overall reading nudged higher. The manufacturing nation -- a bellwether for global trade -- saw exports fall in December.
There were signs of softness across the rest of the region too. Vietnam’s PMI fell to 53.8, while the Philippines PMI fell to 53.2. In export-reliant Singapore, economic growth slowed to an annualized 1.6 percent in the final quarter of 2018, according to data released on Wednesday. Indonesia bucked the trend, with its PMI rising to 51.2.
The readings show how the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China is hurting demand across Asia’s manufacturing hubs. While President Donald Trump has signaled that negotiations with China are making progress, economists remain wary that the talks could stall ahead of a March 1. deadline.
The picture in Asia matches an emerging trend in the U.S., where five Federal Reserve indexes of regional manufacturing all slumped in December, the first time they’ve fallen in unison since May 2016.

429,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 10:30PM ET</span>",Sydney Housing Slump Deepens as Prices Drop Most Since 1980s,"(Bloomberg) -- The downturn in Sydney’s property market is set to deepen this year as tighter lending standards and the worst slump in values since the late 1980s cause nervous buyers to sit on the sidelines.
Average Sydney home values have fallen 11.1 percent since their 2017 peak, according to CoreLogic Inc. data released Wednesday -- surpassing the 9.6 percent top-to-bottom decline when Australia was on the cusp of entering its last recession.
Nationwide, dwelling values declined 4.8 percent in 2018, marking the weakest housing market conditions since 2008, CoreLogic said.
“Access to finance is likely to remain the most significant barrier to an improvement in housing market conditions in 2019,” CoreLogic’s head of research Tim Lawless said. Weak consumer sentiment toward the property market is “likely to continue to dampen housing demand.”
Sydney was the epicenter of a five-year boom and prices are still about 60 percent higher than they were in 2012. That means few existing homeowners are underwater, and the major banks -- which dominate about 80 percent of the mortgage market -- have plenty of buffer before losses would bite.
Yet with some economists tipping a further 10 percent fall in prices in Australia’s most populous city, policy makers are growing nervous. The central bank is worried that a prolonged downturn will drag on consumption and warned last month that the major banks risked amplifying the slump if they all pulled back credit at the same time.
Australia’s prudential regulator last month announced it was dropping a cap on interest-only mortgage lending, loosening credit curbs that have contributed to the downturn. Across the country, house prices have now fallen 5.2 percent from their October 2017 peak.
Capital Economics Ltd. thinks national prices “will eventually fall by 12 percent, rendering the current downturn the longest and deepest on record,” said Marcel Thieliant, senior Australia and New Zealand economist. “That will result in weaker dwellings investment and consumer spending as households respond to falling housing wealth by ramping up savings.”
Sydney led last year’s price declines, with values dropping 8.9 percent, followed by a 7 percent fall in Melbourne, according to CoreLogic.
With elections expected in May, and the main opposition Labor party pledging to curb tax perks for property investors if it wins, confidence is likely to be hit further, Lawless said.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 09:05PM ET</span>",China December factory activity shrinks for first time in 19 months: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, (Reuters) - China's factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in December as domestic and export orders continued to weaken, a private survey showed, pointing to a rocky start for the world's second-largest economy in 2019.
The gloomy readings largely dovetailed with an official survey on Monday which showed growing strains on China's manufacturing sector, a key source of jobs. The findings reinforce views the economy is losing more steam.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December, released on Wednesday, fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, marking the first contraction since May 2017. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast only a marginal dip from November to 50.1, just above the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
New orders -- an indicator of future activity -- fell for the first time in two and a half years, with companies reporting subdued demand despite some price discounting. New export orders shrank for the ninth month in a row.
While production edged higher after two months of stagnation, factories cut jobs for the 62nd month in a row. 
""External demand remained subdued due to the trade frictions between China and the U.S., while domestic demand weakened more notably,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
""It is looking increasingly likely that the Chinese economy may come under greater downward pressure,"" said Zhong. 
The Caixin/Markit survey focuses mostly on smaller businesses, which are believed to be more export oriented.
China's official PMI showed factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years, also pressured by weak demand at home and abroad.
It suggested small and mid-sized firms were seeing a sharper deterioration in business conditions than larger companies, a trend that policymakers have repeatedly tried to address through special loan programs and steps to reduce operating costs.
With business conditions expected to get worse before they get better, China is expected to roll out more support measures in coming months on top of a raft of initiatives in 2018.
The country's top leaders, at an annual meeting in December, pledged to cut taxes and keep liquidity ample while pushing forward trade talks with the United States. 
However, while a deal to end the trade war would help shore up confidence, analysts say it would be no panacea for China's economic woes.
Domestic demand had already been weakening before the two sides started to exchange tit-for-tat tariffs as a regulatory crackdown on risky lending was pushing up borrowing costs.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed last month to a 90-day trade ceasefire to allow for fresh talks. That delayed the most imminent threat for China -- a sharp hike in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that had been set for Jan. 1.
Trump said last weekend that talks were progressing well. But many analysts doubt Beijing and Washington can bridge their many differences and reach a comprehensive trade deal in so short a negotiating window.
MORE HELP COMING 
To encourage cautious bankers to keep lending to struggling firms, the central bank cut the amount of cash banks have to set aside as reserves four times in 2018. Hefty additional cuts are expected this year, along with steps to make it easier for private companies to raise funds and refinance.
Authorities are fast tracking infrastructure projects and cutting import tariffs in a bid to rekindle demand, but the moves will take time to kick in and analysts believe the economy will not stabilize until the middle of this year.
Beijing says China is still on track to hit its 2018 growth target of around 6.5 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2017. But a further slowdown is expected this year even if a trade deal is reached.

The World Bank predicts growth will slow to 6.2 percent in 2019, still robust by global standards but the weakest expansion in nearly 30 years.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 06:05PM ET</span>",Australian home prices mark worst year since 2008,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices skidded nearly 5 percent in 2018, marking their worst year since 2008, led by tighter credit conditions and waning investor interest, and analysts expect the weakness to persist this year.
Property values across the country fell for the 15th consecutive month in December, with the rate of decline in Sydney and Melbourne - the two largest markets - worsening over the year, according to property consultant CoreLogic.
Its index of home prices nationally dropped 1.8 percent in December from November, and tumbled 2.3 percent for the quarter - the worst quarterly decline in eight years.
Values in the combined capital cities fell 1.3 percent in the month and 6.1 percent for the year. Sydney was the worst performing capital city with prices down 1.8 percent in December. 
Regional centers fared better with prices outside the cities staying almost flat. 
""Access to credit has been the most significant factor weighing down housing market conditions over the year,"" said Tim Lawless, head of research at CoreLogic.
Since 2015, regulators have clamped down on risky lending by banks, particularly for interest-only loans, while a raft of scandals amid a high-level government-mandated inquiry has added to an air of caution.
Earlier this year, Australia's prudential regulator did ease some of its lending restrictions, but Lawless said access to finance was likely to remain ""the most significant barrier"" to an improvement in housing market conditions in 2019. 
""Lenders are understandably risk-averse against a backdrop of falling dwelling values, high household debt, rising supply and heightened regulatory focus following the banking royal commission inquiry,"" he said.
The slowdown has been greatest in Sydney where home prices stumbled nearly 9 percent on the year, though Melbourne was catching up with an annual drop of 7 percent.
Sydney and Melbourne comprise about 60 percent of Australia's housing market by value and 40 percent by number.

Rental market conditions were also generally subdued, with weekly rents unchanged over the year across combined capital cities. Falling house prices, however, have boosted rental yields, particularly in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>","China factory activity shrinks for first time in over two years, 2019 looks tougher","By Ryan Woo and Lusha Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years in December, highlighting the challenges facing Beijing as it seeks to end a bruising trade war with Washington and reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown in 2019.
The increasing strain on factories signals a continued loss of momentum in China, adding to worries about softening global growth, especially if the Sino-U.S. dispute drags on. 
Trade frictions are already disrupting global supply chains, fuelling concerns of a bigger blow next year to world trade, investment and shaky financial markets. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - the first snapshot of China's economy each month - fell to 49.4 in December, below the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction, a National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) survey showed on Monday.
It was the first contraction since July 2016 and the weakest reading since February 2016. Analysts had forecast it would dip to 49.9 from 50.0 the previous month. 
China is expected to roll out more economic support measures in coming months on top of a raft of initiatives this year. A prolonged downturn in the factory sector, key for jobs, would likely spark further attempts to juice domestic demand. 
In November, industrial output rose the least in nearly three years, while earnings growth at industrial firms fell for the first time in nearly three years. 
A PMI sub-index on overall factory output prices fell to 43.3 in December from 46.4, signaling earnings erosion. A gauge on overall production fell to 50.8, the lowest since February, from 51.9.
New orders - an indicator of future activity - continued to soften, reinforcing views that business conditions in China will likely get worse before they get better. 
A sub-index for total new orders contracted for the first time in at least a year, falling to 49.7 amid persistently weak demand at home and softening global growth.
New export orders shrank for a seventh straight month, with the sub-index falling to 46.6 from 47.0.
TRADE WAR UNCERTAINTIES
Many analysts doubt that Beijing and Washington can bridge their many differences and reach a comprehensive trade deal in the latest round of talks.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed early this month to a 90-day ceasefire that delayed a planned Jan. 1 U.S. increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods while the two sides negotiate.
Trump said over the weekend that a possible trade deal was progressing well, but few concrete details have emerged.
The trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides this year, hitting industries from autos and technology to U.S. agriculture.
""There are many short-term orders from overseas but few long-term orders received by Chinese factories as caution remains amid the trade uncertainties,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai. 
""The medium to long-term export prospect is not optimistic particularly.""
Warehouses across the U.S. are bursting with Chinese goods after retailers stocked up before fresh tariffs, suggesting little chance of a near-term export rebound even if a trade deal is reached.
CONSUMER CAUTION
One bright spot in the downbeat data was a modest pick-up in the services sector. The official non-manufacturing PMI rose to 53.8 from 53.4.
While that offers some cushion - services account for over half of the economy - consumers remain cautious. 
China's auto sector has been particularly hard hit. Sales in the world's biggest auto market are on track to fall for the first time since at least 1990.
""Last December we saw overall China carmakers' capacity utilization rate at around 56 percent, but now we estimate it is roughly 50 percent,"" Shanghai-based senior analyst Alan Kang at LMC Automotive told Reuters. ""Carmakers in general are cutting production.""
China's stock market tumbled about 25 percent in 2018, while the yuan has lost around 5 percent versus the dollar.[CNY/]
There are also signs China's booming e-commerce may have started to moderate, with the country's express delivery sector seeing slightly slower revenue growth towards year-end. 
The courier sector raked in 542.88 billion yuan ($79 billion) in revenue from January-November, up 22.3 percent from a year earlier, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Monday, citing the State Post Bureau (SPB). 
That was slower than 23.5 percent growth in the first 10 months, and less than the 24.7 percent clip for all of 2017. 
Beijing says China is still on track to hit its growth target of around 6.5 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2017, but the economy is expected to lose a few more steps next year. 
The World Bank predicts growth will slow to 6.2 percent in 2019, still robust by global standards but the weakest expansion in nearly 30 years.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2018 08:15AM ET</span>","Russia's 2018 inflation hits 4.2 pct, above central bank's target","By Polina Nikolskaya
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's consumer price index (CPI) rose slightly above the central bank target of 4 percent in 2018, the statistics service's preliminary data showed on Saturday.
Earlier this month, the central bank raised its key interest rate, seeking to keep a grip on rising inflation spurred by an increase in value-added tax from 2019 and some external factors.
Annual inflation in December accelerated to 4.2 percent, exceeding the central bank's target of 4.0 percent for the first time since June 2017.
Month on month, inflation picked up to 0.8 percent in December from 0.5 percent in November. 
The central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said this month that the central bank had acted proactively trying to curb the inflationary risks. 
Inflationary expectations, another factor the central bank is paying a close attention to, continued to rise in December.
According to Nabiullina, inflation may peak at 6 percent in the first part of next year but the central bank still sees room for the monetary policy easing at the end of 2019 or early 2020. 
Kirill Tremasov, the head of research at Loko-Invest, said it was highly likely that the CPI would continue to rise early next year and that such a trend could be a ""serious argument"" for a further rate hike by the central bank. 
Oil prices fell to their lowest in more than a year this month to less than $50 per barrel because of supply glut fears, sending the rouble to its weakest since mid-September. 

""I rather expect an increase (of the key rate) in February,"" Tremasov said.

436,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 10:08AM ET</span>",U.S. Pending Home Sales Unexpectedly Fall to 4-Year Low,"Investing.com - Contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly fell to their lowest level since 2014, but the National Association of Realtors (NAR) suggested that the U.S. housing market still held a bright outlook for future growth.
NAR said its pending home sales index, which measures signed contracts for homes where transactions have not yet closed, decreased 0.7% to a reading of 101.4 after declining by 2.6% in the previous month.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising by 0.7% last month.
Despite the decline, NAR chief economist Larry Yun noted that, while pending contracts have reached their lowest mark since 2014, he suggested there was no reason to be overly concerned, predicting solid growth potential for the long-term.
“The latest decline in contract signings implies more short-term pullback in the housing sector and does not yet capture the impact of recent favorable conditions of mortgage rates (...) Home sales in 2018 look to close out the year with 5.3 million home sales, which would be similar to that experienced in the year 2000. But given the 17 million more jobs now compared to the turn of the century, the home sales are clearly underperforming today. That also means there is steady longer-term growth potential,” he explained."
437,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",U.S. pending home sales fall unexpectedly in November,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in November, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday, the latest sign of weakness in the U.S. housing market.
The NAR's pending home sales index decreased 0.7 percent from the prior month to 101.4. October's index was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales to rise 0.7 percent last month.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales were down 7.7 percent in November, the eleventh straight year-over-year drop.
The housing market has been constrained by higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventory. Though house price inflation has slowed significantly, it continues to outpace wage growth, sidelining some first-time homebuyers.
The NAR previously reported that home resales rose in November, but recorded their biggest annual decline in 7-1/2 years.
Groundbreaking for new homes also rebounded in November, but completions on single-family homes fell for a third straight month to their lowest level in more than a year.

Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said in a statement on Friday that the pending home sales data was not yet reflecting recent favorable mortgage rate conditions.

The main PMI index declined to 51.7 from 52.6 in November, remaining above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the third month in a row.
Inflationary pressure in the sector softened despite an expected increase in value-added tax next year to 20 percent from 18 percent.
Panelists attributed a slower rise in output prices to higher competition, while the rate of input prices slowed to a nine-month low.
The mood among manufacturing companies remained upbeat, and output expectations in the sector were at their second-highest since May 2013 thanks to client demand.

""Robust optimism stemmed from greater access to new foreign markets and a sustained rise in new business, which manufacturers expect to see continuing through 2019,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit that compiles the survey.

441,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 09:53PM ET</span>","Japan factory output falls, sales slow as risks to economy rise","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output contracted in November and partially reversed the previous month's gain, while retail sales slowed sharply as increasing global risks drag on demand and threaten the country's export-reliant economy.
The 1.1 percent month-on-month fall, pressured by a pullback in production of general purpose machinery, compared with a median market forecast of a 1.9 percent decline, following a 2.9 percent increase in October, the data showed.
While the latest figure was better than expected, the outlook pointed to a bumpier road for Japanese manufacturers. 
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expect output to rise 2.2 percent in December but decline 0.8 percent in January, the data showed.
Friday's data comes at a time of heightening volatility in global markets on concerns over slowing growth in U.S. and Chinese economies, uncertainty about U.S. fiscal and monetary policies, and trade protectionism.
""Factory output is in the trend toward leveling off,"" said Takeshi Minami at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Japan's export-reliant economy will face a severe situation next year due to the U.S.-China trade frictions and their ripple effects just as global trade growth is decelerating.""
Economists expect factory output and economic growth to rebound in the current quarter after a run of natural disasters disrupted production and triggered a third-quarter economic contraction. However, authorities remain wary about the potential impact of the China-U.S. trade war, which has not yet shown up in Japan's output data.
Adding to concerns about overseas demand, Japan's private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy, shows no signs of strength either.
Japanese retail sales rose 1.4 percent in the year to November, slowing sharply from the 3.6 percent increase seen in October and undershooting a 2.2 percent gain expected by economists, separate data showed.
New-model cars, high fuel prices and demand for cosmetics among inbound tourists supported sales. But retailers faced pressure from slowing demand for clothing due to warm weather and for smartphones and digital cameras, highlighting headwinds for domestic consumption.
FURTHER EASING?
Separate data showed Japan's jobless rate rose to 2.5 percent in November from 2.4 percent in October, and the jobs availability grew to 1.63 jobs per applicant from 1.62 in the previous month, near a 44-year high.
Japan's aging and shrinking population has led to a tight job market, causing labor shortages and pushing up wages gradually as many companies scramble to attract workers.
Despite more than five years of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) massive monetary stimulus to conquer price declines, however, inflation is struggling to accelerate, underscoring the challenge the central bank faces.
Analysts say the BOJ is in no position to normalize monetary policy anytime soon despite concerns about side-effects from a prolonged easy money policy, such as a hit to banks' profits because of dwindling margins due to ultra-low interest rates.
Some flag the possibility of further easing down the road given tame inflation, and risks to Japan's economy - the world's third largest - and business investment from a slowdown in global economic growth. Consumer inflation remains well below the BOJ's 2 percent goal.

Tokyo-area's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.9 percent in the year to December, slowing from 1.0 percent in November and matching the 0.9 percent forecast by economists.

The Fed surveyed senior credit officers at 23 institutions between Nov 6 and Nov 19, asking them about a range of market conditions. 
""About three-fourths and two-thirds of the respondents reported that their hedge fund and mutual fund clients, respectively, have some exposure to emerging markets,"" the Fed said, saying it had included questions on emerging market exposure given the ""turmoil"" seen in emerging markets this year.

For most client types, survey respondents said between two-fifths and three-fifths held net-long positions on emerging market assets, meaning they were betting on increases in the values of the assets. But most clients had also increased bets over the course of 2018 that the value of emerging market assets would fall, the Fed said, citing the survey responses.

443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",December Early Indicators Show China Slowed for a Seventh Month,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy slowed for a seventh straight month in December, as the trade war, subdued domestic demand and decelerating factory inflation combined to undercut growth.
That’s the signal from a Bloomberg Economics gauge aggregating the earliest-available indicators on business conditions and market sentiment. The data suggest the government’s stimulus approach and the trade war truce with the U.S. have yet to have much effect on the nation’s growth trajectory.
The data signals that activity is continuing to slow in China, with uncertainties in global trade and sluggish confidence still the major constraints, said David Qu, economist at Bloomberg Economics. ""Recent fluctuation in the commodity market may further undermine manufacturing sector profitability,"" and we will be looking closely at what the government does to stabilize the economy in early 2019, he said.
China’s leadership last week pledged more support for the economy next year, indicating an increasing sense of concern in Beijing over the economy and stalling growth. Even with the current ceasefire for the trade war, there is still no guarantee that there will be a breakthrough before the start of March, when the current truce is set to end.
Official Data
The first official Chinese economic data for December, the purchasing managers indexes for the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, will be released Monday morning in Beijing.
The manufacturing gauge will probably be unchanged at 50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction. Before November, the last time it was so low was mid-2016. The non-manufacturing gauge, which covers construction and services, is forecast to slip a tad, according to the Bloomberg survey.
China’s manufacturing companies are already under pressure with output growing at the slowest in a decade in November and factory inflation decelerating. If the current trade talks fail, higher U.S. tariffs would further damage their prospects.
Outside the trade ceasefire, companies have had little good news to embrace. An index of business confidence among small and mid-sized enterprises maintained by  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) was unchanged at 54.7 in December, and the outlook is bleak as downward pressures continues to mount, according to Shen Lan, the Beijing-based economist in charge of the bank’s survey.
""Export demand weakened while domestic demand remained sluggish for SMEs in December,"" she said in a Dec. 24 report. The acceleration in production was driven mainly by the non-manufacturing and hi-tech industries, while manufacturing slowed further, she wrote. ""Credit conditions generally improved in the fourth quarter, although they did not show further improvement in December.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. consumer confidence posted its sharpest decline in more than three years in December, rattling investors already nervous about the prospect that a global economic slowdown was spilling over into the United States. 
In a sign households were growing more worried about the economy, the Conference Board on Thursday said its consumer confidence index fell this month by 8.3 points to a reading of 136.4, the largest one-month drop since July 2015. 
Other data released by the Labor Department, however, showed the number of new applications for jobless benefits dipping in the latest week. 
U.S. stocks, which enjoyed a huge rally on Wednesday, were trading sharply lower after Thursday's data, with the S&P 500 index (SPX) down about 1.8 percent early in the afternoon. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were higher, while the U.S. dollar (DXY) was weaker against a basket of currencies.
U.S. stock prices have plunged in December as investors worried the U.S. economy could face headwinds due to the global economic slowdown. Adding to those concerns on Thursday was data showing earnings at China's industrial firms dropped in November for the first time in nearly three years.[nL3N1YP2G6] 
Whipsawing financial markets could lead to further drops in consumer confidence, which could eventually make consumers more shy about spending, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
""It will definitely be worthwhile to keep a close eye on the various measures of consumer attitudes,"" Stanley said.
The drop in consumer confidence in December was mostly fueled by falling measures of expectations, with more people expecting jobs will become more scarce.
LABOR MARKET STRENGTH
The labor market, however, appears to still be strong. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended Dec. 22, the Labor Department reported.
Initial claims have now fallen in three of the last four weeks and are just above the 49-year low of 202,000 reached in the week ended Sept. 15. 
After several years of near-steady falls, claims trended higher between mid-September and mid-December, prompting concern the U.S. economy was losing momentum. 
It remains unclear how much of that increase was related to the difficulty government statisticians have in adjusting the claims data for seasonal swings. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 217,000 in the latest week.
The latest claims data ""signals improvement in the labor market relative to a few weeks ago, but softening in conditions relative to a few months ago,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Worries about the economy have also been stoked by signs of weakness in the housing market.
U.S. home prices rose just 0.3 percent in October, leaving the year-over-year increase at 5.7 percent, the smallest gain in more than two years, data from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency showed on Thursday.
A report on new home sales in November will not be released on Thursday as previously scheduled due to a partial shutdown of the federal government.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week for the fourth time this year, but forecast fewer rate hikes next year and signaled its tightening cycle is nearing an end in the face of financial market volatility and slowing global growth.

The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence decreased to 128.1 this month, compared to a reading of 133.7 forecast by economists.
“Expectations regarding job prospects and business conditions weakened, but still suggest that the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace in the short-term. While consumers are ending 2018 on a strong note, back-to-back declines in Expectations are reflective of an increasing concern that the pace of economic growth will begin moderating in the first half of 2019,” Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said.
The headline index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
The Present Situation Index – based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions – declined slightly, from 172.7 to 171.6. The Expectations Index – based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions – decreased from 112.3 last month to 99.1 this month.

China's official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) for December is forecast to slip to 49.9, according to the median forecast of 27 economists in a Reuters poll, below the critical 50 level that separates growth from contraction. 
A contraction in December, which will be the first since July 2016, would signal a continued loss of economic momentum and raises the risks to both China and the global economy, especially if a Sino-U.S. trade dispute drags on.
Already, there are signs the trade frictions between the economic giants are rippling through global supply chains. The fear is that the effects could become more pronounced next year in a blow to world trade and investment. 
Chinese authorities are expected to roll out more supportive measures on top of a range of policy initiatives this year. A prolonged downturn in the factory sector, key for jobs and the overall health of the economy, would likely draw further steps to juice up domestic demand. 
""Such measures - mostly medium to long-term policies - are likely to put a floor under the slowing economy in the second half of next year at the earliest,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai, noting that with global demand slackening, the policy effects could be further delayed. 
There is also uncertainty whether China and the United States can bridge their differences during a temporary ceasefire in their trade war.
At the beginning of this month, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day ceasefire that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal.
Analysts expect China's export growth would come under pressure at the end of the truce period as the boost from cargo front-loading tails off and the drag from cooling global demand intensifies.  
A private survey - the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) - which focuses more on small and medium-sized Chinese firms - is expected to show only marginal growth in December, falling to 50.1 from 50.2 in the previous month.
POLICY SUPPORT
China's economy has been slowing this year as a multi-year government crackdown on shadow lending put increasing financial strains on companies and dent production and investment. 
Data earlier this month showed surprising softness in November's factory output and retail sales. China also reported far weaker-than-expected November exports and imports, reflecting the slowdown in global demand.
The government has in recent months unveiled a slew of policy measures, including cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) to boost lending, tax cuts and steps to fast-track infrastructure projects.
Beijing has particularly focused its attention on small firms and private enterprises, which are vital for economic growth and employment, as tight liquidity conditions and trade frictions further dim their outlook. More policy support is expected in coming months.
""We expect a total of 250 basis points of RRR cuts in 2019, with 100 bps RRR cut likely ahead of the lunar new year starting on Feb. 5,"" Nomura economists wrote in a note. 
The World Bank this month predicted China's economic growth to slow to 6.2 percent in 2019 from an expected 6.5 percent this year.

The gloomy data points to a further loss of economic momentum as a trade dispute with the United States piles pressure on China's vast manufacturing sector and as firms, bracing for a tough year ahead, shelve their investment plans, executives say. 
Industrial profits fell 1.8 percent in November from a year earlier to 594.8 billion yuan ($86.33 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Thursday. It marked the first decline since December 2015.
The fall in profits largely reflected slowing growth in sales and producer prices as well as rising costs, He Ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
Economists expect earnings to continue to worsen next year, weighed down by smaller gains in industrial prices due to cooling demand, with some even warning of the risk of deflation. 
""Soft economic indicators such as producer prices, industrial output and orders all point to further pressure on corporate profitability,"" said Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based analyst at Hwabao Trust, adding that firms' revenues have been hit by shrinking demand.
""Industrial profits next year might very well post a 5-10 percent decline on average.""
In November, China's factory price growth slowed to the weakest pace in two years as domestic demand lost further momentum.
""Survival is paramount for us (next year) – we will be more cautious with our investments,"" Jiang Ming, chairman of Henan-based Tianming Group that has businesses in healthcare, construction and finance, told Reuters.
""We also need to maintain better cashflows and save our ammunition to prepare for the tight, tough and difficult days ahead.""
China's economy expanded at the slowest pace last quarter since the global financial crisis, hit by a years-long deleveraging campaign, cooling property market and a trade dispute with the United States, and is expected to cool further next year. 
The growing pressure has prompted the government to roll out a range of measures to juice up demand. In a key annual economic conference held this month the country's top leaders said they will ratchet up support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and keeping liquidity ample, while promising to push forward trade negotiations with the United States.
At the beginning of this month, U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce delaying a planned U.S. tariff hike on Jan. 1 as they negotiate a trade deal. 
Yet there is uncertainty whether the two sides can bridge their differences over a myriad of issues - including trade and intellectual property rights - to reach a durable pact. 
MORE BAD NEWS IN 2019
Earnings growth at China's industrial firms has been cooling since April this year as factory price gains slowed on the back growing strains in the global economy. The bitter trade war with the United States has also pressured overall output and demand in a blow to business investment plans. 
For the first eleven months, profits at industrial firms rose 11.8 percent from the same period a year earlier to 6.1 trillion yuan, slowing from a 13.6 percent increase in January-October. In the same period, earnings growth at state-owned industrial enterprises also cooled. 
Upstream sectors such as oil extraction, coal and metal mining still commanded the lion's share of profit gains in the 11-month period but again their growth softened in November. 
Profits for oil and natural gas extraction rose 333 percent in the first eleven months of the year, easing off from a 371 percent jump for January-October.
""The next drag on profits would likely come from upstream sectors where raw material prices have been sliding fast,"" Hwabao Trust's Nie said.
With the arrival of winter, industrial output has taken a hit as the government intensifies a crackdown on pollution to restrict production in smoke-belching factories. 
China's top steelmaking city Tangshan asked steel mills earlier this month to cut extra output during December 9 and 31, which is an additional reduction on top of that ordered during the winter heating season.
All of this pointed to more bad news for businesses next year.
""We expect the downtrend in industrial profit growth to extend into 2019 given weakening domestic demand, the continued credit downcycle and an escalation in the China-US trade conflict,"" Nomura analysts said in a note to clients.

In the first 11 months of 2018, industrial profits rose 11.8% year-on-year, slower than a 13.6% rise in the January to October period, the data showed.
Slowing growth in sales and producer prices, and rising costs, contributed to the decline in profits, He ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
Meanwhile, analysts said rising trade tensions with the United States also piled pressure on China's manufacturing sector, although recent reports seemed to suggest there may be some progress made on the trade issues between the two countries.

The group, which represents business directors and leaders, said its confidence tracker briefly reached positive territory earlier this year when there was agreement on a Brexit transition period, but had fallen steadily since April and hit its lowest level this month.
Prime Minister Theresa May faces deep opposition from both her own lawmakers and opposition parties to the divorce agreement she has negotiated with the EU, raising the risk of a ""no-deal"" departure, something that could hurt the economy.
IoD senior economist Tej Parikh said there was no doubt that the tumultuous Brexit process was having a damaging impact on firms' outlooks.
""Business leaders are looking ahead to the new year with trepidation about the economy,"" he said. 
""While we saw cautious optimism emerging when the Brexit talks appeared to be moving towards a transition period after March 2019, that has utterly dissipated now. 
""The prospect of a no-deal in the near future will be weighing heavily on directors' minds.""
Business investment has fallen for three consecutive quarters, official figures showed earlier this month, and other recent data has pointed to a slowdown in growth ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union in 93 days.
The IoD said, however, that while business leaders were pessimistic about the economy, confidence in their own firms remained relatively upbeat.
Optimism levels for the wider economy stood at -38 percent in December, it said, but the corresponding level for respondents' own companies was +30 percent, little changed from 31 percent a year ago.

The IoD said 724 business leaders contributed to the survey in December.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports in December are likely to increase less than in the previous month due to cooling demand from major economies led by China, a Reuters survey found on Wednesday. 
The median forecast from 10 economists polled was a 3.3 percent rise in exports from a year earlier, down from 4.1 percent growth in November and below a 6.2 percent gain for the first 11 months of this year.
Imports are seen rising 4.2 percent in December from a year earlier, sharply down from November's 11.5 percent increase.
If December exports match the poll forecast, there will be growth of 5.9 percent for the year, way below 2017's gain of 15.8 percent. 
The finance ministry sees export growth slowing to 3.1 percent next year.
Analysts said recent declines in prices of key South Korean export items, such as memory chips and oil products, could lead to annual declines export value early in the new year.
""Falling semiconductor prices and global oil prices could lead to contraction in South Korean exports in the first quarter,"" said Lee Seung-hoon, an economist at Meritz Securities.
South Korea is the world's leading exporter of chips, and a major source of ships, cars and petroleum products. It is the first major exporter to report monthly trade data, which provides an early reading of global trade conditions. 
For the first 20 days of December, South Korea's overseas sales of memory chips fell by 9.8 percent in value from a year earlier, according to customs agency data released earlier.
""Easing in the Sino-U.S. trade conflict and a rebound in global oil prices are essential for sustained growth in South Korean exports,"" said Lee Sang-jae, an economist at Eugene Investment & Securities. 
In November, South Korea's exports to China, its biggest trade partner, declined for the first time since October 2016 and chip exports increased the least since November 2016.
Also in the latest poll, respondents see December's annual headline inflation rate slowing to 1.7 percent from November's 2.0 percent, which matched the central bank's target.
Industrial output in November was seen shrinking 0.2 percent from a month earlier versus a 1 percent gain in October, the poll showed.

Total budget revenues are seen at 2.8 billion marka, up 1.4 percent from this year, fueled mainly by an expected 1.5 percent rise in tax revenues to 2.6 billion marka. That is based on government projections of 3.7 percent economic growth and 1.2 percent inflation in 2019.
The budget will have a meager surplus of 56 million marka which will be used to pay debt, Finance Minister Zora Vidovic said early on Sunday. 
More than one third of the budget, or 1.245 billion marka, will be spent on social benefits, including pension payments, with debt servicing costs of 490 million marka. The amount set aside for payment of salaries will increase 4.8 percent to 756 million marka.
""We have to be realistic, the budget is rather more socially orientated than development orientated, although investment into education and health has been envisaged,"" Vidovic told Reuters.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's economy grew 1.2 percent in 2018, below the government's forecast, and is expected to expand 1.5 percent in 2019 despite falling export revenues and continued austerity measures, the communist-run country's economy minister said on Friday.
Economic growth has slowed in part due to a steady decline in export earnings since 2014, which has led Cuba to slash imports and fall behind on payments to some suppliers, joint venture partners and governments.
The government had planned on 2 percent growth for this year, Economy and Planning Minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez told an end-of-year parliament meeting. The economy grew 1.8 percent in 2017.
Gil said sectors such as sugar, agriculture and tourism would rebound next year after poor performances in 2018, largely caused by the impact of Hurricane Irma in September 2017 and out-of-season rainfall this year.
Economic growth this year and in 2019 would also be driven by an expansion of social services such as free healthcare, Gil said.
Cuba estimates the value of these services and includes it in its gross domestic product, unlike most countries.
Gil said debt and other financial problems, aggravated by tighter U.S. sanctions which cost the country $4.3 billion, also dragged down the economy. He added that Cuba would not increase its debt load in 2019 to achieve growth.
""We have to hold back the increase in debt. We will begin to reduce the debt, paying out more than the new credits,"" he said.
Cuba last reported its foreign debt as $15.8 billion in 2015.
The decline in export earnings has occurred even as debt payments mounted, which has been offset somewhat by increased revenues from telecommunications and remittances, though those earnings are treated as state secrets.
Combined exports and imports fell around 25 percent from 2013 through 2017, with annual imports dropping to $11.3 billion from $15.6 billion during that period, according to the government.
The government began reducing fuel and power allocations to state-run enterprises in 2016.
In August, the government slapped a hold on approved ""non-essential"" imports and further cut fuel allocations.
The measures have led to scattered shortages of everything from bread and medicine to eggs as production sputters for lack of spare parts and raw materials.

Gill said the country also drew on its inventories and improved repatriation of export earnings and other efficiencies to keep the economy in the black, measures that would continue in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed slightly more than previously estimated in the third quarter and momentum appears to have moderated further in the fourth quarter, with new orders and shipments of manufactured capital goods falling in November. 
Growth in the October-December quarter could still be strong and keep the economy on track to achieve the Trump administration's 3 percent target this year. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy increased solidly in November, other data showed on Friday.
""Business spending looks to be losing momentum, placing the onus on households to keep the economic expansion going at a decent rate,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.4 percent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its third reading of third-quarter GDP growth. That was slightly down from the 3.5 percent pace estimated last month and above the economy's growth potential, which economists estimate to be about 2 percent. 
The revision to the third-quarter GDP reading reflected markdowns to consumer spending and exports. Estimates for business spending on equipment and nonresidential structures were lowered as were those for residential investment. 
Those downward revisions were, however, partially offset by a larger accumulation of inventory than previously estimated. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent pace in the April-June quarter.
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the fourth time this year, but forecast fewer rate hikes next year and signaled its tightening cycle is nearing an end in the face of financial market volatility and slowing global growth.
The U.S. central bank slightly lowered its growth projections for 2019. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors monitored political developments in Washington, where President Donald Trump threatened a ""very long"" government shutdown just hours ahead of a midnight deadline.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed in choppy trade, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly flat. 
Growth is being driven by the government's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which has given consumer spending a jolt. The fiscal stimulus is part of measures adopted by the White House to boost annual growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis. 
But the economy appears to be slowing in the fourth quarter.
In a second report on Friday, the Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.6 percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in October. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.2 percent last month. Core capital goods orders advanced 6.5 percent on a year-on-year basis in November. 
SOLID CONSUMER SPENDING
Last month's drop in core capital goods orders added to data on the housing market and trade that have flagged a slowdown in economic growth in the October-December quarter.
There were decreases in orders for machinery and for electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for computers and electronic products were unchanged in November.
Shipments of core capital goods slipped 0.1 percent in November after jumping 0.8 percent in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business spending on equipment grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the third quarter. It has been slowing despite a lower tax bill for corporations. Some companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale.
Spending on equipment could remain sluggish as sinking crude prices reduce demand for oil well drilling equipment. Brent crude fell to a more than one-year low of $52.79 per barrel on Friday amid worries of oversupply. 
Industry data last week showed domestic energy firms cut oil rigs for a second week.
Economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 2.7 percent rate. The slowdown in growth is expected to spill over into 2019 as the fiscal stimulus fades and a bitter trade war with China and strong dollar undercut manufacturing. Some regional manufacturing surveys have weakened in December.
""The drop in the more sentiment-driven headlines as well as the soft reading on actual orders sparks some concerns, and raises the possibility that trade tensions and slowing global growth are beginning to weigh on activity here in the United States,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
In a third report on Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in November, boosted by outlays on motor vehicles, utilities and recreation, after surging 0.8 percent in October.
Economists had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.3 percent in November. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3 percent last month after jumping 0.6 percent in October.
While strong consumer spending is seen blunting the hit on the economy from the deteriorating trade deficit, a weakening housing market and slowing business investment on equipment, sluggish income growth suggests the pace of consumption is probably unsustainable.
Personal income rose 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in October. Wages rose 0.2 percent in November after increasing 0.4 percent in October. Incomes were also held back by drops in dividend and social security benefit payments. 
Economists said while a tightening labor market could boost wages in 2019, gains were likely to be curbed by slower job growth.
""Higher interest rates, waning fiscal stimulus, and weaker global growth will take the wind out of the labor market's 10-year uninterrupted run, bringing income growth down considerably lower through 2020 and into 2021,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Savings fell to an 11-month low of $944.2 billion last month from $962.9 billion in October.

In November, spending on goods increased 0.4 percent after surging 0.9 percent in October. Outlays on services climbed 0.4 percent after shooting up 0.7 percent the prior month.
Inflation pressures remained moderate in November. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components edged up 0.1 percent, matching October's gain.
That lifted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.9 percent from an eight-month low of 1.8 percent in October.
The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",UK economy relies on stretched consumers as Brexit hits investment,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy relied on its financially stretched households to power growth in the three months to September as businesses, worried about Brexit, cut investment for the longest period since the global financial crisis, official data indicated.
The figures also showed the country's balance of payments shortfall was its widest in two years.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed a preliminary estimate that Britain's economy - the world's fifth-biggest - grew by 0.6 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months.
That was the fastest increase since the end of 2016 as consumers spent heavily during the World Cup soccer tournament and a heat wave.
But more recent data suggested growth is slowing sharply ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union in less than 100 days time, and as the global economy weakens.
Prime Minister Theresa May faces deep opposition in her Conservative Party to the divorce agreement she negotiated with the EU, raising the risk of a ""no-deal"" departure, something that could hurt the economy.
ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said households spent more than they received for an unprecedented eighth quarter in a row, raising questions about their ability to keep on spending and driving the country's economy.
Real household disposable income was flat in the third quarter, the second weakest reading since the start of 2017.
""The longer-term picture remains subdued and business investment has now fallen for three consecutive quarters,"" Kent Smith said. 
The last time businesses cut back on investment for three or more quarters in a row was during the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago.
The Bank of England said on Thursday that companies were scaling back investment due to Brexit uncertainty, although the risk of disruption at the borders had boosted spending on warehousing and port capacity.
Friday's ONS data showed inventories were their highest since the end of 2016, suggesting companies were stockpiling to avoid potential customs delays after Brexit.
Earlier on Friday, private-sector economic surveys showed the weakest consumer sentiment since 2013, and the lowest business morale since 2016's Brexit referendum, as well as the biggest drop in car production since 2009.
On Thursday the BoE lowered its growth forecasts, predicting quarterly expansion of just 0.2 percent for last three months of 2018 and the first three months of 2019.
CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WIDENS
The ONS said the difference between money flowing in and out of Britain widened to 26.5 billion pounds ($33.5 billion) in the third quarter, the biggest deficit since the third quarter of 2016 
It was bigger than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
BoE Governor Mark Carney has previously warned that the large current account deficit left Britain reliant on ""the kindness of strangers"".
   The deficit was equivalent to 4.9 percent of the country's economic output, again the widest in two years and up from 3.8 percent in the three months to June.
However at least some of the shortfall appeared to be due to positive news - higher profits at foreign-owned British companies, some of which flowed to overseas investors.
The ONS also said Britain narrowed its budget deficit by more than anticipated to 7.2 billion pounds. For the first eight months of the financial year, the deficit was just under 33 billion pounds, down nearly 30 percent from 2017.
Finance minister Philip Hammond has promised that an end to government austerity is within sight, but his plans to relax his grip on public spending could be knocked off course if Britain's economy suffers from a disruptive exit from the EU.

""Fine news for Christmas. The government's employment goal of 72 percent has now been achieved,"" Prime Minister Juha Sipila said on his Twitter account, four months ahead of parliamentary elections due in April.
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate stood at 7.1 percent in November, down from 8.2 percent a year ago, Statistics Finland said.
The employment rate excludes some working-age people including students as well as parents who remain at home to care for children.
Increasing the employment rate is crucial for Finland's public finances as the population is aging, with fewer people working and paying taxes to help finance care for the elderly. 
Finance Minister Petteri Orpo tweeted that the government should now aim for an employment rate over 75 percent.
That might prove difficult, however, as forecasters have recently cut down their GDP growth projections for coming years. 
After a decade of stagnation, Finland's economy has seen an upswing with GDP growth of 2.8 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2016, though the employment rate still lags Nordic peers.

In June 2015 when Sipila's government took office, the employment rate stood at 68 percent and the economy was struggling to break out of a three-year recession.

GDP grew by 1.5% on a year-to-year basis in the quarter, unchanged from the preliminary estimate and in line with expectations. 
On a quarterly basis, growth came in at 0.6%, which was also in line with expectations for no change from the preliminary reading.
Ongoing political turmoil regarding Brexit negotiations continues to hamper confidence in British economic growth.
Earlier on Friday, Brexit uncertainty was blamed for the decline in the GfK index of consumer confidence to minus 14 in December, while expectations for the economy over the next 12 months tumbled to its lowest since December 2011.
As the Bank of England held interest rates steady this week, policymakers warned that Brexit uncertainties had “intensified considerably”.
“The broader economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the form of new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate,” the central bank said."

PARIS (Reuters) - French business confidence plunged to a more than two-year low in December after violent anti-government protests as the economy closes the year on a rough note, official data showed.
The confidence slump implies the economy has slowed since growth peaked this year in the third quarter at 0.3 percent, which Friday's data showed was weaker than previously thought.
The INSEE statistics agency said its business confidence index fell to 102 points in December from 105 last month - the lowest level since November 2016.
Confidence in the retail sector suffered particularly badly after Paris saw the worst unrest in decades from ""yellow vest"" demonstrators during crucial, pre-holiday shopping days this month. The index for the retail sector fell to 100 from 107, its lowest since January 2015.
Many businesses in central Paris have had to board up on Saturdays after some had windows broken during the rampaging through some of the French capital's poshest neighborhoods.
Parisian department store Printemps for one has seen sales at its flagship store slump around 10 percent in December, its Chief Executive Pierre Pellarey told Franceinfo radio.
The protests have also hit hotels in the world's top tourist destination, costing the industry in Paris 18 million euros ($20.6 million) in lost revenue from cancellations.
Earlier this week, INSEE forecast the economy likely slowed to 0.2 percent growth in the final quarter due in part to the protests over fuel tax hikes squeezing household budgets.
Already in the third quarter, the economy grew only 0.3 percent from the previous three months, INSEE said on Friday, revising down from a previous estimate of 0.4 percent.
After tax hikes and transport strikes weighed on activity in the first half of 2018, the economy is on course for soft full year growth, which INSEE has forecast at 1.5 percent.
The third quarter data lent some credence to protesters' claims their purchasing power is squeezed by high taxes.
The government offered concessions this month aimed at boosting the poor's income.
INSEE said households' real disposable income growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the third quarter from 0.8 percent in the previous three months as wage growth slowed and the tax burden rose. 
Nevertheless, consumer spending grew 0.4 percent in the quarter after pulling back slightly in the previous period as households saved marginally less. 
The savings rate eased to 14.4 percent from 14.5 percent.
Meanwhile, corporate investment rose 1.5 percent as firms' profit margins advanced to 31.9 percent from 31.7 percent in the second quarter, boosted by productivity gains, INSEE said.

The poll also showed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) core inflation measure likely increased 1.9 percent from a year earlier in November, unchanged from the previous month.
Irvin Seah, a senior economist with Singapore's biggest lender DBS, said the expected CPI dip was partly technical - due to a high reading last November - and could also be impacted by slipping oil prices and a supply glut in the domestic car market.
""The CPI inflation numbers have been pretty sluggish in the last few months,"" Seah, who is predicting a 0.6 percent y/y reading for November, said. 
Oil prices have this week hit their lowest in more than a year on worries about oversupply and the outlook for energy demand. [O/R]
The central bank's core inflation measure - which excludes changes in the price of cars and accommodation - is seen as a gauge more closely watched by policymakers who have tightened policy in both of their semi-annual meetings this year.
At its meeting in October, MAS said the city-state's economy is likely to expand steadily barring a setback to global growth from trade frictions between the United States and China.
""Core inflation remains fairly steady...so nothing that would cause the MAS to back down from their current policy,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.
""Given that their starting point was a very gradual approach to tightening, I don't think they are going to be knocked off their seats by whatever goes on in the oil market.""

468,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","UK consumers gloomiest since 2013, car production slumps","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers are their gloomiest in more than five years, business sentiment is its weakest since the 2016 Brexit referendum and car output has tumbled this year, according to three surveys that paint an ominous picture for 2019.
Brexit worries weighed on consumer and business morale, according to the surveys, while car production is falling at its fastest rate since Britain was last in recession in 2009.
GfK's monthly consumer sentiment index edged down to -14 in December from -13, its lowest since July 2013 although it was in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll.
While consumers felt better about their personal finances over the past year and were more willing to make major purchases, their expectations for the economy over the next 12 months tumbled to its lowest since December 2011.
""In the face of ever-rising costs, and the threat of higher inflation combined with uncertainty around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, it's no surprise that consumers are in a chilly mood of despondency,"" GfK executive Joe Staton said.
With less than 100 days until Britain is due to leave the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to win the support of much of her Conservative Party for the deal she struck last month with other EU leaders.
Without a deal Britain risks major economic disruption when it leaves the bloc.
On Thursday, Bank of England officials trimmed their forecast for quarterly economic growth in the last three months of 2018 to 0.2 percent from 0.3 percent and said the picture in early 2019 was likely to be similar.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank said on Friday its monthly survey of business sentiment sank to its lowest since just after the referendum decision in June 2016 to leave the EU.
Similar to consumers, businesses were more downbeat about the outlook for the economy than their own financial situation.
""The expected slowdown in economic growth in Q4 could well be extended into early 2019, but there is potential for a rebound in sentiment should there be some respite in uncertainties that firms currently face,"" Lloyds economist Hann-Ju Ho said.
A big slump in car production last month -- linked to weaker growth in export markets as well as Brexit worries -- is almost certain to weigh on fourth-quarter economic growth figures. 
The number of cars produced in Britain in November fell 19.6 percent from a year earlier to 129,030, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. 
This was the biggest year-on-year drop in nine months, and production for the year to date is down 8.2 percent at 1.44 million cars, the biggest such decline since Britain's last recession in 2009.

""Output (was) seriously impacted by falling business and consumer confidence in the UK allied to weakening export markets,"" SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said. ""If the country falls off a cliff-edge next March the consequences would be devastating.""

469,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 06:41PM ET</span>","Global banks chase Asia techs transaction business, as trade war rumbles","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global lenders including  Citigroup  (N:C) and HSBC (L:HSBA) are stepping up efforts to sell day-to-day banking services to Asia's fast-growing new technology firms, amid growing competition for more traditional transaction banking.
The workaday transaction banking business, which refers to services that deal with companies' operational needs such as trade financing, cash management and facilitating payments, has been a source of stable returns without consuming much capital for banks in Asia, the largest trading region in the world.
While the impact of the trade war between the United States and China has not been felt on that business yet - in part because a temporary truce has delayed new tariffs that were due to kick in on Jan. 1 - analysts say the tensions have clouded the outlook for Asian economies and goods trade and made the services sector more attractive.
The targets for the new initiative include e-commerce firms, mobile payment service providers and ride-hailing companies – from China's Ant Financial and Grab in Southeast Asia to PayTM and Flipkart in India, said senior bankers and consultants.
Standard trade finance business has become commoditized, and Asia is seeing rapid digitisation of cash and growing demand for real-time transaction infrastructure, said Rajesh Mehta, Citi's Asia Pacific head of treasury and trade solutions.
""Cash management for e-commerce companies ... with their long distribution chains in the region is becoming a big opportunity, as these companies grow and their supply chain network becomes bigger and more complex,"" he said.
Citi saw revenues from its technology clients, including e-commerce firms, surging 20 percent so far this year compared with the same period last year, up from 17 percent growth in 2017, making it the fastest growing segment for the bank's Asia Pacific treasury and trade solutions unit.
The growth across banks in this segment is set to be boosted by surging transactions involving digital platforms in Asia and as many technology firms go cross-border, potentially offsetting any impact from the trade war, banking industry officials said.
The digital commerce market in Asia Pacific is set to surge two-fold to reach more than $1.1 trillion by 2022, accounting for almost two-thirds of the business globally, according to consultancy Accenture (NYSE:ACN).
""The big play here is how can one dominate the services economy going forward and that's where the big battleground is,"" said Mohit Mehrotra, Deloitte Asia Pacific strategy consulting co-leader. ""All these trade wars are about the goods economy.""
DIGITAL PUSH IN ASIA
The sharpened focus on techs is also crucial as transaction banking has become the bedrock in Asia for global banks, who use those deep and sticky relationships with clients to pitch other services such as investment and private banking. 
The transaction banking offerings for the online platforms include processing of payments from customers and to suppliers in real-time, at times in multiple currencies, as well as managing payrolls and creating innovative financing structures.
HSBC, for example, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, is working with Hong Kong logistics start-ups GoGoVan and Lalamove to facilitate the collection of real-time digital payments on a faster payment system. 
In June, the British-headquartered lender also closed a S$500-million ($364 million), five-year asset-backed syndicated loan for Singapore-based ride-hailing service Grab.
""We have relationship managers now focusing much more keenly on new-economy and services sectors to manage their increasingly digital needs,"" said Stuart Tait, head of commercial banking in Asia Pacific at HSBC.
The scramble among global banks for a bigger share of transaction banking business from technology companies in Asia also comes as many of those firms are going cross-border and expanding their offerings.
While China's Ant Financial and Tencent are battling for the mobile payment business in Southeast Asia, ride-hailing services Grab and Go-Jek are vying to bring banking, e-commerce and food-delivery to every corner of Southeast Asia.
""Even if there is a lot of cash in Asia, it is digitizing at a much faster pace than anywhere outside the region,"" Morgan McKenney, Citi Asia Pacific cash management head, said. ""Anyone with 'pay' in their name we typically support.""
 Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) was in June this year picked by Ant Financial, operator of China's biggest mobile payment platform, to enable real-time fund transfer for its blockchain technology-based cross-border digital wallet remittance service.
With a view to grabbing a bigger share of the business, the banks are investing more in technology, entering into tie-ups with fintechs, and doing in-house data mining to understand consumer trends and cash flows in the digital economy.
""Speed of delivery of transaction banking services and accuracy of delivery are very critical for the digital technology companies,"" StanChart's global head of transaction banking, Lisa Robins, said.

""New technology, big data, fast payments, artificial intelligence, blockchain, all of that enable you to move, manage and finance the physical and financial supply chains faster and quicker.""

471,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Regulators criticize loans as concerns grow about falling recoveries,"By Kristen Haunss
NEW YORK (LPC) - Recent volatility in the U.S. leveraged loan market has increased concerns about diminished recoveries as regulators ratchet up criticism of the asset class.
Recoveries for first-lien loans are forecast to be about 61 percent, down from the average historical recovery of 77 percent, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Recoveries for second-lien loans are forecast to be just 14 percent, down from the average historical rate of 43 percent.
The pessimistic forecasts come as regulators express concern about underwriting quality as market volatility increases. A benchmark of 100 of the most widely held loans fell 292bp since the start of November to 95.43 on Wednesday, the lowest level since February 2016 when both the equity and credit markets were pressured by the economy and lower oil prices.
“When you think about the next downturn, leveraged loan recovery values are a concern,” said Andrea DiCenso, a co-portfolio manager for the alpha strategies team at Loomis Sayles. “It has me questioning, are the recovery values we used to assign to them kind of moot at this point?” 
SENTIMENT SHIFT
The $1.1 trillion US leveraged loan market is a hedge to rising interest rates because the debt pays investors a coupon plus the London interbank offered rate. As rates rise, so do the distributions lenders receive. This is an attractive investment as the Federal Reserve (Fed) continues to raise rates, hiking them on Wednesday for the ninth time in the last three years. The U.S. central bank has indicated that pace will slow in 2019.
The U.S. loan market has almost doubled in size since 2008, buttressed by the $582 billion U.S. Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) market, the largest buyers of the debt, which set a new issuance record in 2018 with more than $126 billion arranged.
The uptick in CLO volume as well as investments in loan mutual funds and separately managed accounts allowed companies to cut borrowing costs and loosen document terms, including removing lender protections.
More than $585 billion of U.S. institutional loans were arranged in the first three quarters of the year after a record $923.8 billion was issued in all of 2017, according to LPC data. About 73 percent of the leveraged loan market is covenant-lite.
Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, Senator Elizabeth Warren and the Bank of England have all expressed concerns about the loose underwriting as market sentiment has deteriorated.
Loans have a negative 2.6 percent performance since the start of November, and banks have had to widen pricing and tighten document terms to entice investors.
JP Morgan deepened the discount on a loan for aviation company XO Management to 93 cents on the dollar this month, the lowest original issue discount since the fourth quarter of 2016, according to LPC data. Some companies have chosen to pull or postpone their deals all together, including Ulterra Drilling Technologies, which delayed syndication of a loan backing its buyout by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group, and information technology services provider ConvergeOne, which postponed to January syndication of a facility to back its buyout by CVC Capital Partners.
Business Development Companies (BDCs), investors in the middle market, have not escaped the volatility. The average share price to net asset value across the public BDC universe has plummeted to 0.796 times as of Tuesday’s close, the lowest level since early 2016, according to LPC analysis.
While CLO issuance has remained steady, even as tranche spreads widened, retail investors have pulled more than $6.6 billion from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds since mid-November, including $2.5 billion in the week ending December 12, the largest one-week outflow since Lipper started tracking in 2003.
Loans are notorious for their slow settlement times and Fed Governor Lael Brainard raised concerns this month about mutual funds being able to meet redemption requests, a refrain the Securities and Exchange Commission has previously expressed.
Loans settled in an average 20.3 days in 2017, according to IHS Markit. Open-end funds need to meet redemption requests in seven days. 
LOAN MARKET FOCUS
Despite recent volatility, defaults have remained low, supported by covenant-lite issuance, which removes many potential triggers.
The U.S. speculative-grade corporate default rate was 2.7 percent in September 2018 and Standard & Poor’s forecasts it will fall to 2.5 percent by September 2019. Fitch Ratings says the institutional leveraged loan default rate will finish 2018 at 1.8 percent.
But danger looms as the number of companies rated B3 with a negative outlook or lower sits at 182, according to Moody’s, with about 44 percent of first-time issuers in 2018 holding a B3 corporate family rating, “the lowest rating you can get and still access the market,” according to Christina Padgett, a senior vice president at the ratings firm.
“We have more low-rated credits today than we did at the peak of the financial crisis,” she said.
If there is a significant wave of company downgrades to a Caa rating, CLOs, which typically have a cap on the percentage of assets they hold with that ranking or lower, often around 7.5 percent, can be impacted, forcing them to divert payments from the most junior fund investors, according to Algis Remeza, associate managing director at Moody’s.
The focus on the asset class comes as U.S. government agencies say they will not take enforcement action based on supervisory guidance. The move is a blow to leveraged lending guidance, updated by regulators in 2013 and treated as a rule by banks, which many attribute with keeping some terms measured. 
The consequence of not taking action may be private equity buyouts that are even bigger and more highly leveraged, some market participants have warned.
Despite the recent upheaval, forecasts for 2019 are strong.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) is calling for $400 billion-$420 billion of loan issuance next year, dominated by merger, acquisition and buyout financing, the bank said in a November report. CLO issuance is also expected to be strong with JP Morgan calling for what would be a new record of $135 billion of issuance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits rose marginally from near a 49-year low last week, suggesting underlying strength in the labor market and broader economy.
While other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowing to near a 2-1/2-year low in December, manufacturers reported hiring more workers and were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months. 
Concerns are growing that tightening financial market conditions, partly the result of a relentless selloff on Wall Street, could spill over into the labor market and economy. Economists said the weekly jobless claims data showed no sign that the financial market volatility was impacting on companies' hiring decisions.
""This does not appear to be the case at present, and we still see the main signal from claims data as one of healthy labor market conditions,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Dec. 15, the Labor Department said. Claims had dropped to 206,000 in the prior week, close to the 202,000 reached in mid-September, which was the lowest level since December 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 216,000 in the latest week.
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the fourth time this year, but forecast fewer rate hikes next year and signaled its tightening cycle is nearing an end in the face of financial market volatility and slowing global growth. 
The U.S. central bank said ""the labor market has continued to strengthen,"" and described job gains as having been ""strong, on average, in recent months.""
The Labor Department said no claims were estimated last week. Claims have been volatile in recent weeks, with some economists saying an early Thanksgiving holiday had pulled forward seasonal layoffs, throwing off a model that the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 222,000 last week. A jump in filings to an eight-month high of 235,000 during the week ended Nov. 24 had stirred concerns the labor market was slowing.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the Fed's interest rate decision and projections for monetary policy next year. U.S. Treasury yields fell to more than eight-month lows. The dollar (DXY) dropped against a basket of currencies and U.S. stocks were trading lower.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET 
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of December's employment report. Claims fell 11,000 between the November and December survey weeks, suggesting some improvement in job growth this month.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 155,000 jobs last month after surging by 237,000 in October.
November's slowdown in job growth was largely blamed on a shortage of workers amid a tight labor market. The unemployment rate is near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent and not too far from the Fed's forecast of 3.5 percent by the end of 2019.
""Payrolls should post a solid gain and the unemployment rate has a strong chance of slipping to 3.6 percent,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Tightening labor market conditions are pushing up wage growth, helping to underpin consumer spending. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index fell to a reading of 9.4 in December. That was the lowest level since August 2016 and followed a reading of 12.9 in November. 
The moderation in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware is broadly in line with other data suggesting some softening in national factory activity amid slowing global demand. 
A report from the New York Fed earlier this week showed a sharp drop in its Empire State manufacturing index in December.
""The manufacturing sector is more exposed than the overall economy to slowing in foreign growth,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region, however, continued to report overall higher employment. The survey's measure of factory employment increased to a reading of 18.3 this month from 16.3 in November.

Factories also reported strong growth in new orders and unfilled orders this month. But the survey's current shipments index decreased 12 points to its lowest reading in 27 months. Manufacturers were upbeat about the next six months, with more than 43 percent of the firms expecting increases in activity, while 12 percent anticipated declines.

The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to hold rates steady at 0.75%.
“Brexit uncertainties have intensified considerably since the Committee’s last meeting,” the BoE explained in its meeting minutes, pointing to the fact that those uncertainties were weighing on financial markets and the near-term outlook for economic growth in the UK.
“The broader economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the form of new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate,” the central bank said.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since November 2017, but policymakers made clear that the next move could be in either direction, depending on the impact from Brexit.
Economists widely anticipate the British monetary authority to remain on hold until after the March 29 exit data, making the meeting in May the first viable possibility.
“Given all the noise surrounding Brexit, it’s looking increasingly likely that the central bank will remain on hold through the first half of 2019 (and possibly beyond),” ING economists said in a note."
476,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Swedish Riksbank Surprises With First Rate Hike in Seven Years,"(Bloomberg) -- For the first time in seven years, the Swedish central bank raised interest rates, surprising many in the market as policy makers chose to focus on low unemployment instead of an uncertain outlook driven by global trade conflicts.
The Riksbank, which is based in Stockholm, added a quarter of a percentage point to its repo rate, bringing it to minus 0.25 percent. The decision was expected by fewer than half the 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
With inflation and inflation expectations now looking “established” around the Riksbank’s 2 percent target, “the need for a highly expansionary monetary policy has decreased slightly,” the bank said in a statement on Thursday. Policy makers, who had signaled they were ready to deliver a hike either this month or in February, said the next increase will probably come in the second half of 2019.
The krona soared on the news, appreciating as much as 1 percent against the euro, which is its biggest gain since early October.
The Riksbank is hiking as it and other central banks try to gauge conflicting information, with unemployment low across large parts of the developed world while stock markets are tanking and a trade war is raging. The Federal Reserve this week went ahead with a rate increase, but struck a more cautious tone about the future. The European Central Bank is ending its flagship stimulus program, though it has signaled rates will remain at record lows “at least” through the summer.
The Riksbank said that its decision follows an assessment that “the employment rate is historically high, companies are reporting major shortages of labor and cost pressures are rising.”
Many economists said they viewed the decision as a compromise, with a second rate increase not seen coming until late next year. At Nordea, economist Torbjorn Isaksson said the wording the bank used “strengthens our view that the next rate hike is a long way off.”
The krona pared some of its gains, but was still trading about 0.8 percent higher against the euro about an hour after the decision was announced.
Here’s what Robert Bergqvist, the chief economist at SEB, had to say about the decision:
At Svenska Handelsbanken, Chief Economist Christina Nyman called it a “very dovish hike.”
“The rate path was clearly revised down, so that’s maybe sending a signal that they are not completely happy with inflation pressure, but it’s still a first step. I don’t think you can see it as the beginning of a rate hike cycle.”
Timing is everything and the Riksbank has been burned in the past when it raised rates at the wrong point in the cycle. The bank was attacked by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman for what he dubbed as sadomonetarism, when it started hiking at the height of Europe’s debt crisis. Back then, it was forced to do a U-turn that ultimately led it into the extremes of stimulus it’s now trying to exit.
At the current level, “monetary policy is still expansionary and will thereby continue to support economic activity,” the bank said.

Fears about trade friction, the effects of Brexit and a weaker global economy are hitting the outlook for export-oriented Germany and economists are scaling back their forecasts, making domestic demand more important.
The Statistics Office said nominal wages were up 3.6 percent between July and September from the year ago period, the strongest increase since the second quarter of 2011, while consumer prices climbed 2.1 percent from the previous year.
The biggest increases were in the property, culture and entertainment sectors while earnings in education and other service areas fell short of the average.
Gross average earnings were 4,013 euros per month in western German states and 3,173 euros in the former Communist East, said the Office.

The country's household debt grew 6.7 percent by the end of September over a year earlier, beating a 4.0 percent gain in disposable income, the Bank of Korea said in its biannual financial stability report.
This brought the ratio of household debt against disposable income to 162.1 percent by the end of September, compared with 158.0 percent a year earlier, it said. The ratio also ticked up from 161.0 percent at the end of June.
The country's overall financial system maintained its stability and soundness against shocks, it added. 
Last month, the central bank raised its policy rate  by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent in its first tightening in a year and called for continued vigilance against the still high debt burden.

Still, analysts expect slowing economic growth and low inflation to persuade the central bank to refrain from further tightening its policy, at least throughout next year.

Its outlook on China's 2018 economic growth, which would be the weakest in 28 years, remained unchanged from its prediction in April.
""Looking ahead, China's key policy challenge is to manage trade-related headwinds while maintaining efforts to limit financial risks,"" the bank said its latest assessment on the world's second-largest economy.
Consumption will remain the main driver of China's economy, as weaker credit growth weighs on investment and slowing global demand and higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese shipments take a toll on the country's exports, the report said.
""To stimulate the economy, fiscal policy could focus on boosting household consumption rather than public infrastructure,"" the bank said, adding that China has room to further lower business taxes.
The government has pledged to cut taxes more aggressively next year, spurring a debate among Chinese economists on whether Beijing should expand its fiscal deficit ratio beyond 3 percent next year.
The government has in recent months unveiled a raft of policy measures, including cuts in banks' reserve requirements to spur lending, tax cuts and steps to fast-track infrastructure projects.
Growth in Asia's powerhouse economy slowed to 6.5 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis. Indications are that momentum is likely to come off further in the current quarter and next year, with data last week showing surprising softness in November factory output and retail sales.
In October, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast on China's 2019 economic growth to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent while keeping its 2018 outlook unchanged.

The World Bank said that while China continues its trade talks with the United States, it should increase its efforts to address trade partners' concerns over intellectual property protection and technology transfers.

482,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>",Fed Boosts Rates by Quarter Point but Signals Slower Pace of Hikes in 2019,"Investing.com - The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, but pivoted toward a slower rate-hike cycle as the economy is expected to cool.
The Federal Open Market Committee raised the fed funds rate 25 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.
The decision, while expected, was unwelcome news to the stock market. Equities rallied sharply leading up to the decision, with the Dow up around 300 points, But right after the market, the blue chip index and the broader market had given up all gains. As Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference wore on, the dovish feeling flew out the window and selling snowballed, with the Dow down as much as 500 points.
""The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" the Fed said in a statement.
Members of the rate-setting committee reduced their 2019 median forecast for interest rates to 2.9% from a previous estimate of 3.1%, hinting at two rates hikes in 2019. That's below the three rate hikes previously indicated in the Fed's September projections.
The interest-rate outlook for both 2020 and 2021 was lowered to 3.1% from 3.4%, which guides to one hike that year.
The longer run interest rate was also cut to 2.8% from 3.0%.
For decades the Federal Reserve has operated under a dual mandate seeking to achieve maximum employment, while ensuring inflation remains steady. But inflation and economic growth are expected to slow in the coming year, giving the Fed reason to rein in tightening.
The economy is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2019, down from 2.5% previously, and by 2.0% in 2020, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections showed.
The pace of inflation, meanwhile, is forecast to cool to a rate of 2.0%, down from 2.1% previously. While core-PCE inflation for both 2019 and 2020 was also revised lower to 2.0 from 2.1%.
The most recent reading of the core PCE index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, came in at 1.8%, a notch below the central bank's 2% target.
The unemployment rate, which fell to a 49-year low in December, is expected to come in at 3.5% in 2019, unchanged from a prior forecast.
The rate hike comes as some had expected the Fed to pause in the wake of criticism from President Donald Trump, but Fed chief Powell downplayed any notion that the president could influence the central bank's decision on monetary policy.
""Political considerations play no role on our discussions on monetary policy,"" Powell said.
Trump earlier this week said the Fed would be making “yet another mistake” by raising rates and urged the central bank to ""feel the market"" rather than ""go by the numbers."""
483,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 12:49PM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales rise; trend weak,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly rose in November, but recorded their biggest annual decline in 7-1/2 years as the housing market remained mired in weakness.
There are concerns that the persistent housing market weakness could spill over to the broader economy, which continues to be bolstered by robust consumer spending. 
The softening housing market is not expected to discourage the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates when officials wrap up a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs three times this year. 
""The trend in housing is clearly slowing as affordability takes a bite,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 1.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.32 million units last month. October's sales pace was unrevised at 5.22 million units. 
Sales have now increased for two straight months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales falling 0.6 percent to a rate of 5.20 million units in November.
But in November existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, tumbled 7.0 percent from a year ago, the largest annual drop since May 2011. 
Sales are down 2.3 percent in the first 11 months of 2018 compared to the same period last year.
The housing market is being constrained by higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventory. Though house price inflation has slowed significantly, it continues to outpace wage growth, sidelining some first-time homebuyers.
A survey on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dropped to more than a 3-1/2-year low in December. Single-family homebuilding dropped to a 1-1/2-year trough in November, government data showed on Tuesday.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading higher, in line with a broadly firmer U.S. stock market amid optimism that the Fed will signal fewer interest rate increases for 2019. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
SUPPLY IMPROVING
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans for purchase a home tumbled almost 7 percent last week from the previous week. 
The decrease in applications came despite the 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling to a three-month low. But at 4.63 percent, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is more than 60 basis points higher than it was at the end of 2017.
""We think the drag from rates will persist into 2019,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Last month, existing home sales rose in the Northeast, Midwest and populous South. They fell in the West, which the NAR said was experiencing a marked shift from very fast sales and exorbitant prices to slowing demand and price growth.
There were 1.74 million previously owned homes on the market in November, up from 1.67 million a year ago. The inventory crunch is easing as demand moderates especially in the West, which had seen intense bidding wars. 
At November's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.3 months in October and up from 3.5 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
The median existing house price increased 4.2 percent from a year ago to $257,700 in November. 
Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 42 days in November, up from 36 days in October and 40 days a year ago. Forty-three percent of homes sold in November were on the market for less than a month. 
There were still some hot housing markets last month in some metro areas in Texas, Ohio, Indiana and Massachusetts.
The share of first-time buyers increased to 33 percent last month from 31 percent in October and 29 percent a year earlier. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.

According to the NAR, sales were slowing in the upper end of the market. It said inventory remained tight on the lower end, which accounts for a large portion of the housing market.

Existing home sales rose by 1.9% in November from the previous month at an annualized pace of 5.32 million units, confounding expectations for a 0.6% decline. But sales were still 7% lower than a year ago.
“The market conditions in November were mixed, with good signs of stabilizing home sales compared to recent months, though down significantly from one year ago,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
The median existing-home price for all housing types in November was $257,700, up 4.2% from the same period in 2017 ($247,200). November’s price increase marks the 81st-straight month of year-over-year gains.
“Inventory is plentiful on the upper-end, but a mismatch between supply and demand exists at affordable price points,” Yun said.
“A marked shift is occurring in the West region, with much lower sales and very soft price growth, It is also the West region where consumers have expressed the weakest sentiment about home buying, largely due to lack of affordable housing inventory,” he concluded."

The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened to $124.8 billion, or 2.4 percent of national economic output, in the July-September period. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to widen to $124.3 billion.
The department report also showed a rebound in foreign direct investment during the third quarter, with foreign firms sinking $116.3 billion into the country. 
The rebound followed a rare drop in foreign investment during the second quarter, which some analysts attributed to questions over how a 2017 tax overall would be implemented and trade tensions between the United States and a range of trade partners. 
Wednesday's data seemed to suggest that any impact on foreign investment was so far fleeting. Over the past two quarters, foreign firms invested about $115 billion in the United States, up from about $109 billion in the prior two quarters.
The Commerce Department said a tax overhaul passed by Congress in December 2017, which changed how repatriated earnings are taxed, led many companies to bring back cash parked abroad. 

Companies paid out dividends and other withdrawals of $92.7 billion from foreign receipts during the third quarter, the department said, which far outstripped the amount of this cash which was reinvested.

486,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Canadian Inflation Slips Below Poloz’s Target on Gasoline Plunge,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s inflation rate dropped to its slowest pace in 10 months in November as gasoline prices plunged, easing pressure on the Bank of Canada to press ahead with interest rate increases.
The consumer price index recorded an annual pace of 1.7 percent in November, down from 2.4 percent in October, as gasoline prices recorded their biggest one-month drop in almost four years. Economists had forecast a 1.8 percent pace.
The data paint a benign picture for inflation for the Canadian economy, with little sign of underlying price pressures that would prompt more immediacy from the Bank of Canada.
Core measures of inflation -- seen as a better gauge of pressures -- nudged slightly lower in November, averaging 1.9 percent during the month. That’s down from 2 percent in October.
A 2 percent core rate is consistent with an economy at full capacity -- but not one that is overheating. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz reiterated as recently as this week that policy makers expect they will continue to move borrowing costs higher eventually in part because core inflation is near its 2 percent target. The Canadian central bank has raised interest rates five times since the middle of last year.
Investors aren’t pricing in the next increase until at least April.
The data Wednesday confirm the spike in consumer prices earlier this year, with inflation rising to a seven-year high of 3 percent in July, was transitory -- as the Bank of Canada had predicted at the time.
Gasoline prices, responsible for the spike, are now acting as a drag on the inflation index. They are down 5.4 percent from a year earlier.
Still, underlying inflation pressures remain stronger than they were earlier this year. Core measures have hovered around the 2 percent level since February, after averaging 1.5 percent in 2017.
In its most recent forecasts released in October, the central bank estimated inflation would average 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter.

Since his campaign to become president in 2016, Trump has complained about Japan's $69 billion trade surplus with the United State, particularly in the autos sector, which accounts about 75 percent of the imbalance. Washington and Tokyo are set to start fresh trade talks early next year.

It was the biggest fall since 2000. Another 39 percent say the relationship is ""bad"", up from 23 percent.

PDF of survey: https://tmsnrt.rs/2EBJ0gk
Representing the six-month outlook of 84 firms, the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index edged up to 63 in the October-December quarter, slightly above a near three-year low of 58 seen in the previous period.
Anything above 50 indicates a positive outlook. But the latest result still marks one of the lowest readings since a rout in Chinese stocks in mid-2015 rattled world markets. 
""This confirms the reading of the previous quarter: there is more uncertainty, there are increasing concerns about growth,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.
""This doesn't mean there is going to be a crisis over the next quarters, but if there is one, this is an indication that it wouldn't be a large surprise to some.""
Once again, a global trade war was cited as the chief business risk by respondents. A slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy China and higher interest rates were also cited as risk factors. The survey was conducted in 11 Asia-Pacific countries, across a range of sectors from Nov. 30 to Dec. 14. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping earlier this month agreed to a truce that delayed a planned Jan. 1 increase of U.S. tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal.
But that deal remains far from certain.
Trump has long railed against China's trade surplus with the United States, and Washington accuses Beijing of not playing fairly on trade. China calls the United States protectionist and has resisted what it views as attempts to intimidate it.

The dispute between the world's two biggest economies, threatens businesses throughout the region due to global value chains.
Firms in the tech and telecoms sector - where valuations have already been hit by concerns over slowing global demand - were one of the most pessimistic in the survey with their lowest-ever reading of 44.
""Everyone is under pressure from valuations anyway in this sector,"" said Suresh Sidhu, chief executive officer of Malaysian telecoms firm edotco Group Sdn Bhd [IPO-EDOT.KL].
""The fact that the trade war and currencies, particularly if you are Asian, start to mess with your revenue and earnings models has added another whammy."" 
Firms in Taiwan, an important node in the global electronics industry, had the most negative outlook by country in the survey at 17. On a country basis, that marked the steepest fall in the quarter, from 58 in Q3. 
Companies in other mature economies such as Korea and Japan were among the most pessimistic, while firms in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia - the rapidly developing Southeast Asia region - were the most optimistic.
However, even for emerging Asia, there are concerns over the scramble to keep up with rising U.S. interest rates as regional central banks move to defend their currencies against a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Rising rates was a concern flagged by Thai-based hotel operator Minor International PCL, which recently acquired a Spanish hotel group in a multi-billion dollar deal.
""This is the biggest acquisition we have done in our history so any movement in interest rates definitely impacts our cost of funding,"" said the firm's investor relations director Supitcha Fooanant.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export growth slowed to a crawl in November as shipments to the United States and China weakened sharply, in a sign slowing external demand and a Sino-U.S. trade dispute may leave the economy underpowered over the next year.
The 0.1 percent year-on-year rise in exports undershot a 1.8 percent annual increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll, and was well below a 8.2 percent jump in October.
The trade data highlights rising external risks for Japan's export-led economy, and comes as the Bank of Japan reviews policy at a two-day meeting that ends Thursday. 
With consumer inflation remaining weak, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its current ultra-easy policy.
Japan's exports to the United States grew 1.6 percent year-on-year in November, led by shipments of airplane motors and semiconductor production equipment, slowing sharply from October's 11.6 percent jump.
U.S.-bound auto exports fell 7.0 percent to 163,586 units.
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Japan as well as China over trade, threatening to impose steep tariffs on imports of Japanese cars, which make up about two-thirds of Japan's $69 billion annual trade surplus with the United States.
Japan's imports from the United States rose 8.1 percent in the year to November, led by feed corn, medicines and oil products, helping reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. by 5.4 percent on the year to 623.4 billion yen ($5.55 billion). It was marked the fifth straight month of declines.
Exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 0.4 percent in the year to November, slowing sharply from the previous month's 9.0 percent annual gain. November's increase was led by shipments of plastic materials, heavy oil and motors.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, fell 1.9 percent in November, down for the first time in nine months.
Japan's overall imports rose 12.5 percent in the year to November, roughly in line with the median estimate for a 11.5 percent annual increase.
The trade balance came to a deficit of 737.3 billion yen, versus a deficit of 600.3 billion yen expected by economists. It marked a second straight month of shortfalls.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, contracted the most in over four years in the third quarter due to a series of natural disasters that hurt factory activity and supply chains.

Analysts expect a rebound in growth in the current quarter as temporary effects of natural disasters fade away, but trade frictions and slowing external demand cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy.

PwC projected economic growth in 2019 of 1.6 percent for Britain -- assuming the country manages to avoid the shock of a no-deal Brexit in March -- versus 1.7 percent for France and 7.6 percent for India.
""The UK and France have regularly alternated in having the larger economy, but subdued growth in the UK in 2018 and again in 2019 is likely to tip the balance in France's favor,"" PwC economist Mike Jakeman said.
The ranking is based on the size of national economies in U.S. dollar terms. 
Britain's economy slowed and the value of the pound slumped after the 2016 Brexit referendum decision to leave the EU.
""India is the fastest-growing large economy in the world, with an enormous population, favorable demographics and high catch-up potential due to low initial GDP (gross domestic product) per head,"" Jakeman said. 
""It is all but certain to continue to rise in the global GDP league table in the coming decades.""

PwC expects India to rise to fifth place next year from seventh, and France to remain at sixth.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy is on course to grow only 0.2 percent in the final three months of the year, down from 0.4 percent in the third quarter, INSEE forecast in its quarterly outlook.
INSEE had previously predicted growth of 0.4 percent in the final quarter as the economy rebounded from a weak start to the year. But it cut its estimate, forecasting the protests would lop 0.1 percentage points off quarterly growth, with softer business confidence accounting for the rest of the revision.
But even before the protests, business confidence had been deteriorating in the face of international trade tensions, INSEE said.
As a result for the whole of 2018, INSEE forecast growth of 1.5 percent, downgraded from 1.6 percent in its previous outlook in October and down from a decade-long high of 2.3 percent last year.
Looking ahead to next year, INSEE forecast growth would rebound 0.4 percent in the first quarter as consumer spending recovered after a weak end to 2018. Growth was then expected to ease to 0.3 percent in the second quarter.
Many retailers have had to shutter stores on key year-end shopping days as protests originally against fuel-tax hikes turned violent in November and December.
The protests quickly snowballed into a broader movement against the high-cost of living, forcing President Emmanuel Macron to announce a series of measures for poor workers and pensioners.
Those measures, which include wage increases for the poorest workers and a tax cut for most pensioner, would boost consumer spending next year, although it was unclear now by how much, INSEE said.
Even without those measures, growth in households' real disposable income was expected to pick up at the end of the year after a cut in payroll contributions and housing tax took effect while inflation also eased.
With oil prices falling, inflation was expected to gradually ease from a peak of 2.2 percent in the third quarter to only 1.0 percent by mid 2019.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts rise; single-family segment still weak,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rebounded in November, driven by a surge in multi-family housing projects, but construction of single-family homes fell to a 1-1/2-year low, pointing to deepening housing market weakness that could spill over to the broader economy.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed housing starts fell in October instead of rising as previously reported. Underscoring the housing market weakness, single-family home completions dropped for a third straight month in November to their lowest level in more than a year.
""The residential construction market hit the pause button in 2018,"" said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow. ""Speculation has already begun as to whether the construction industry is a macroeconomic canary in the coalmine signaling a larger shift to come.""
Housing starts increased 3.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million units last month. Data for October was revised down to show starts dropping to a rate of 1.217 million units instead of the previously reported pace of 1.228 million units. 
November's increase in homebuilding followed two straight monthly declines. Housing starts fell 3.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in November. While building permits shot up 5.0 percent to a rate of 1.328 million units last month, they were powered by a jump in the volatile multi-family housing segment. 
Permits for single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, barely rose last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts slipping to a pace of 1.225 million units last month.
The housing market is being constrained by higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventories. Though house price inflation has slowed significantly, it continues to outpace wage growth, sidelining some first-time homebuyers.
Continued weakness in the sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, could be flagging a slowdown in the overall economy. Economists, however, do not expect the softening housing market will discourage the Federal Reserve from hiking rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday.
The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs three times this year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen more than 60 basis points in 2018 to about 4.63 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
""Mortgage rates have already priced in a 3.0 percent Fed funds rate more or less, so a few more Fed rate hikes won't sting the housing market any further,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""It is important to stay on a gradual path of rate hikes or they risk telegraphing to the markets and investors that they are worried about the economic outlook.""
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, in line with a broadly stronger U.S. stock market. The dollar slipped to a one-week low against a basket of currencies amid caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
HOUSING DRAG
Residential investment contracted in the first three quarters of this year, the longest stretch since mid-2009. 
Homebuilding investment is expected to have declined again in the fourth quarter and the soft patch is seen persisting through the first half of 2019. Housing and trade are expected to cut into economic growth in the October-December period.
Last month, single-family homebuilding dropped 4.6 percent to a rate of 824,000 units, the lowest level since May 2017. It was the third straight monthly decline in single-family homebuilding.
A survey on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dropped to more than a 2-1/2-year low in December, with builders reporting that ""consumer demand exists, but customers are hesitating to make a purchase because of rising home costs.""
Single-family starts in the South, which accounts for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.8 percent last month. They tumbled 9.5 percent in the Northeast and plunged 24.4 percent in the West, probably because of wildfires in California.
Groundbreaking activity on single-family homes dropped 3.2 percent in the Midwest.
Permits to build single-family homes edged up 0.1 percent in November to a pace of 848,0000 units. These permits are now above the level of single-family starts, suggesting some pickup in homebuilding is likely.
Starts for the multi-family housing segment soared 22.4 percent to a rate of 432,000 units in November. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes rose 14.8 percent to a pace of 480,000 units. The multi-family housing segment is being boosted by demand for rental apartments.
""Until the demand for owner-occupied homes rebounds, it is difficult to see why single-family starts will turn around,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Tuesday's data also suggested that housing supply is likely to remain tight in the near term. Single-family homebuilding completions in November dropped 5.4 percent to a rate of 772,000 million units, the lowest level since August 2017.

The stock of housing under construction increased 0.7 percent to a rate of 1.148 million units last month. But the multi-family homes segment made up more than half of housing inventory under construction last month.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 05:59AM ET</span>",German economy faces 'lean' Christmas as business morale sinks,"By Joseph Nasr and Rene Wagner
BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale fell in December, a survey indicated on Tuesday, suggesting that concerns among company executives about the growth outlook for Europe's biggest economy are rising.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index fell for the fourth month in a row to 101.0, its lowest level in more than two years. This was weaker than a Reuters consensus forecast of 101.8.
""Concern is growing among German businesses,"" said Ifo chief Clemens Fuest. ""Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation. Their business expectations also continued to deteriorate. The German economy faces a lean festive season.""
Trade frictions, risks linked to the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union next year without a deal and weaker growth in emerging markets are putting the brakes on a nine-year upswing in Europe's economic powerhouse.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said the German economy was slowing but there was no recession in sight.
This has prompted the government to lower its growth forecast for this year to up to 1.6 percent. Ifo said the business climate level confirmed its prediction for 1.5 percent growth.
As the year draws to a close, the risks for the German economy appear to be outweighing any impetus from the global economy, said Andreas Scheuerle of DekaBank.
'NO CHRISTMAS DELIGHTS'
Scheuerle cited Brexit and mass anti-government protests in France as possible headwinds for Germany, adding that signs of a detente in the trade conflict between China and the United States could spell good news for the German economy.
""Global news is fluctuating between concerns and relief,"" said Scheuerle. ""Pre-Christmas delights are not to be expected,"" he wrote in a note.""
The government hopes tax cuts for middle and high income earners as well as higher child allowances that go into effect in January will boost consumption, which has replaced exports as the main driver of growth.
Ifo's Wohlrabe said consumption could be performing better in view of increases in income and employment.
The economy is expected to rebound in the fourth quarter after a contraction of 0.2 percent between July and September, partly because one-off effects like bottlenecks in new car registrations due to stricter pollution standards should ease.
A low interest rates environment created by the European Central Bank, a solid labor market and rising wages should provide growth momentum in the face of rising risks.
""The risks to our forecast for growth in Germany to rebound, from 1.5 percent this year to 1.8 percent in 2019, are clearly mounting,"" said Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics.
He added: ""For now we are still forecasting the ECB to raise interest rates in September 2019 but it is looking increasingly likely that a softer economic backdrop will force it to leave policy rates unchanged for longer.""

500,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>","Japan cuts GDP, CPI forecasts on disasters and trade war","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government revised down its forecasts for economic growth and consumer prices for the current and next fiscal years as natural disasters and weakening export demand weighed on the economy, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.
The forecast cuts follow disappointing data on quarterly gross domestic product and machinery orders, highlighting the growing downside risks posed by a trade war between the United States and China.
The government will use the forecasts to finalize the state budget for the next fiscal year starting in April, which could present policymakers with a host of challenges as they prepare to raise the nationwide sales tax.
Japan's economy will grow 0.9 percent in fiscal 2018, which ends in March, the Cabinet Office said. That is down from its previous projection of 1.5 percent growth.
In fiscal 2019 the economy will expand 1.3 percent, also down from the previous forecast of 1.5 percent growth.
Overseas demand will not contribute to growth either in the current or the following fiscal year due to a slowdown in China's economy and weak demand for electronic parts in Asia, a Cabinet Office official said.
Capital expenditure is expected to rise 3.6 percent in fiscal 2018 and then slow to 2.7 percent growth in fiscal 2019, partly because companies are cautious due to global trade friction, the official also said.
Overall consumer prices are expected to rise 1.0 percent this fiscal year, down from a 1.1 percent increase expected previously.
In fiscal 2019, overall prices will rise 1.1 percent, less than the previous forecast of a 1.5 percent increase.
Private consumption is expected to expand 0.7 percent this fiscal year and then accelerate to 1.2 percent growth in fiscal 2019, as consumers shake off the impact of a strong earthquake and heavy floods in September.
The government will raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October next year to help offset rising welfare costs.
The government has already planned for tax breaks and stimulus spending to offset any negative impact on consumer spending.
This stimulus, combined with an expected improvement in workers' wages, should prevent consumer spending from weakening, according to the official.
Japan's economy posted its biggest contraction in four years in July-September due to a fall in capital expenditure. The economy likely resumed expansion in the current quarter, but a row between Washington and Beijing over tariffs and trade policy is a threat to Japan's export-focused economy.

The government usually issues economic projections for the coming fiscal year in December when compiling the annual budget, and revises them around mid-year.

The business lobby said growth in 2018 was likely to slow to 1.2 percent before inching up to 1.3 percent in 2019, which would be the two weakest years since Britain emerged from recession in 2009 after the global financial crisis.
""While Brexit isn't the only factor affecting businesses and trade, it is hugely important -- and the lack of certainty over the UK's future relationship with the EU has led to many firms hitting the pause button on their growth plans,"" BCC director Adam Marshall said. 
Britain's economy has slowed since the Brexit referendum in 2016 and there is no guarantee that businesses and consumers will retain tariff-free access to European goods when Britain leaves the European Union which is scheduled for March 29.
The BCC said sterling's weakness against the dollar and the euro was likely to continue to drive inflation, eating into consumers' disposable income, while business investment was due to contract by 0.6 percent this year and barely grow the next.
Separately, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors predicted that house prices would be flat next year, the first year with no growth since 2012, due to Brexit uncertainty and the inability of many buyers to afford higher prices.
""On the back of this, house price growth at a UK level seems set to lose further momentum, although the lack of supply and a still solid labor market backdrop will likely prevent negative trends,"" RICS's head of policy, Hew Edgar, said.

The number of houses being sold was likely to fall around 5 percent next year, RICS added.

A reading above 50 indicates a favorable outlook on home sales; below indicates a negative outlook.
“We are hearing from builders that consumer demand exists, but that customers are hesitating to make a purchase because of rising home costs,” NAHB chairman Randy Noel explained.
“The fact that builder confidence dropped significantly in areas of the country with high home prices shows how the growing housing affordability crisis is hurting the market,” NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz said. “This housing slowdown is an early indicator of economic softening, and it is important that builders manage supply-side costs to keep home prices competitive for buyers at different price points.”"

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said that CPI rose 1.9% in November from the same month a year earlier.
Consensus had expected no change from the initial estimate of 2.0%.
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose by an annual rate of 1.0%, unchanged from the preliminary estimate and in line with forecasts.
The ECB targets a headline inflation rate of close to, but just below 2%.
At its last policy meeting earlier this month, the ECB left interest rates on hold and confirmed plans to wind up its massive bond purchasing stimulus program. While no longer adding additional purchases to its €2.6 trillion ($2.96 trillion) four-year-long bond buying program, the monetary authority plans to reinvest principal payments from maturing securities “for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates”.
ECB president Mario Draghi indicated that the risks to the euro area growth outlook remained “broadly balanced”, but warned that the balance was “moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.”
Despite the decision to halt the asset purchase program, markets have become increasingly skeptical about the ECB moving ahead with a rate hike in the coming year.
“With the end of the net-QE purchases, all eyes will be on the timing of the first rate hike,” ING economists commented. “However, given doubts about the strength of the Eurozone recovery and underlying inflation not gaining momentum, the ECB will take a very dovish stance, pushing the timing of a first deposit rate hike towards the end of the year. A refi-rate hike may not happen until 2020!”"

""The policy rate is likely to be kept at the current level."" 

Higher interest rates could also lift the Taiwan dollar, hurting the island's export competitiveness.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending fell by the most since July last month, payments company Visa (NYSE:V) said on Tuesday, adding to signs of slowing economic growth toward the end of the year.
Consumer spending dropped 0.7 percent year-on-year in November, a sharper decline than October's 0.2 percent drop, Visa said, based on inflation-adjusted usage data from its debit, credit and prepaid cards.
Black Friday discounts did not remedy slowing spending as some retailers had hoped. Challenging economic conditions and uncertainty surrounding Britain's upcoming departure from the European Union have weighed on British consumer confidence, with expenditure down most months so far this year. 
""The disappointing trend reflects relatively subdued consumer confidence as uncertainty lingers over the outcome of ongoing Brexit negotiations,"" IHS Markit economist Annabel Fiddes said.
While spending at bars and restaurants picked up to grow by a robust 5.1 percent, expenditure on clothes, recreation and transport and communication all dropped by more than 2 percent in November compared with a year earlier.
Online shopping growth slowed, but still outperformed face-to-face sales. Last week market research company Springboard said the number of shoppers on the high street and at retail parks dropped by the most of any November since it started collecting data in 2009.

""Economic conditions are likely to remain challenging for retailers, at least in the short term,"" Visa economist Adolfo Laurenti said.

Average asking prices for new sellers were down by a monthly 1.5 percent in the four weeks to Dec. 8 after a fall of 1.7 percent in the previous month, Rightmove said on Monday.
On an annual basis, asking prices across the country rose by 0.7 percent but fell in London by 1.1 percent.
Before the Brexit referendum in June 2016, asking prices as measured by Rightmove were rising by around 7 percent a year.
Rightmove director Miles Shipside said sellers typically priced properties lower before Christmas to get buyers' attention.
""However, these falls have been larger than usual, making this the largest fall over two months for six years, showing that there are more than just seasonal forces at play,"" he said.
The weakness in Britain's housing market has appeared in other measures of house prices, something surveyors say reflects the uncertainty about the country's exit from the European Union in March.

Restaurant chains such as Carluccio's, Prezzo, Jamie's Italian and Strada have closed outlets in the last year, and there are few signs of any pick-up in demand.
""Closures in the restaurant sector are at epidemic levels now,"" Jeremy Willmont, head of restructuring and insolvency at Moore Stephens, said in a statement.
""The impact is visible on almost every high street of a major town or city."" 
Moore Stephens said that 1,219 restaurants closed across the country between September 2017 and September 2018, up from 985 a year earlier.
""In the wake of Brexit uncertainty and interest rate rises, it seems consumers are tightening their belts and discretionary spending is the first thing to go,"" Willmont said.
British consumer spending grew last month at its slowest pace in more than a year and retailers have already sounded warnings about the Christmas period, including  Sports Direct  (L:SPD) owner Mike Ashley, who said on Thursday that trading in November was ""unbelievably bad"".

Restaurants also faced pressure from rising wages and higher food and beverage prices due to a weak pound, Moore Stephens said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's new home prices slowed in November as markets in smaller cities lost some of their heat, though the sector remained relatively resilient amid a broader slowdown in economic activity.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.9 percent in November from a month earlier, slower than the previous month's 1 percent and the weakest since September, Reuters calculations based on an official survey showed on Saturday.
The data marks the 43rd straight month of price increases, Reuters calculation showed, a log trend that's remained intact despite curbs designed to rein in a near-three year real estate boom that has spread from megacities to the hinterland.
In a sign strength remains broad-based, 63 out of the 70 cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported monthly price increases for new homes, slightly lower than 65 in October.
Compared with a year earlier, new home prices rose 9.3 percent, the fastest since July 2017 and quickening from October's 8.6 percent gain, according to data issued by the NBS. 
China's property market has remained relatively resilient as many investors exploit regulatory loopholes and turn to smaller cities where restrictions are lighter. Some speculators are also betting that many local governments, which rely on revenue from real estate, will be reluctant to tighten the regulatory screws too stringently.
In contrast, China's November retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy lost momentum amid the heated trade dispute between Beijing and the United States.
But sentiment in the property sector has also turned more bearish recently following a surge in failed land auctions as the economy slows and policymakers remain unwilling to loosen their control of the sector.
Economists were particularly concerned about a slump in China's smaller markets where economic fundamentals are weaker, although some expect credit easing measures to prop up the sector.
China's 35 tier-3 cities reported an average price increase of 0.9 percent, slowing from 1.1 percent in the previous month, while its 31 tier-2 cities - which comprise sizeable provincial capitals - saw a price increase of 1.0 percent in October from a month earlier.
""Tier-3 cities that had previously supported the market are recently showing feeble growth and hotspot tier-1 and 2 cities are gradually starting to overall cool,"" Zhang Dawei, an analyst at Hong Kong-based real estate research consultancy Centraline, wrote in a note.
""Given tightening finance, growing debt pressure and declining sales rates, real estate companies might choose to lower prices to boost sales, in order to ensure cashflow and meet year-end sale targets,"" Zhang wrote.
A Reuters poll this week showed property investment would slow to 4 percent in 2019, while housing sales are expected to fall 5 percent amid slowing economic activity and tough financing conditions for smaller developers.
China's four biggest cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou posted 0.3 in their average monthly prices.
The northern city of Hohhot was the top performer, rising 2.9 percent from October, NBS data showed.
While solid growth in the sector could cushion the impact of a long government crackdown on debt and simmering trade tensions, policymakers worry it could stoke fears of a sudden crash if prices climb too quickly given elevated levels of household debt.
Property investment in China picked up in November, a sharp contrast to other parts of the economy, which have weakened.
However, recent soft home sales and land purchases suggest a dim outlook for the sector.
November sales by floor area were 5.1 percent lower than a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, increased to 656 billion yuan in November from 563.6 billion yuan in October, central bank data showed.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 12:45PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending strengthening in boost to economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending gathered momentum in November as households bought furniture, electronics and a range of other goods, which could further allay fears of a significant slowdown in the American economy even as the outlook overseas continued to darken.
The upbeat data from the Commerce Department on Friday bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a fourth time this year at its Dec. 18-19 policy meeting, despite moderating inflation and tighter financial market conditions. 
It also stood in stark contrast to reports from China showing a dramatic fall-off in retail sales in the world's second-largest economy and from Europe where a key measure of business activity expanded at its slowest rate in four years.
The U.S. central bank has hiked rates three times this year.
""Today's report shows Fed officials consumers just aren't confident, they are also putting their money where the mouths are and buying enough goods to keep the economy humming,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services surged 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent increase in October.
These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have gained 0.3 percent in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.4 percent last month. 
November's increase in core retail sales and upward revisions to October's data suggested a brisk pace of consumer spending in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, increased at a 3.6 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter.
A sharp sell-off on Wall Street and partial inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve had stoked fears of a recession. But worries over the economy's health were eased on Thursday after government data showed the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell back to a near 49-year low last week.
A Reuters poll released on Thursday showed economists now see the risk of recession in the next two years at 40 percent, up from 35 percent last month. 
In the wake of the strong core retail sales numbers, economists bumped up estimates for fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth to as high as a 3.0 percent rate from around a 2.4 percent pace.
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the July-September period. Spending is being boosted by a tightening labor market, which is starting to spur faster wage growth, lower taxes and moderate inflation. It remains strong despite the sharp stock market losses.
The dollar hit a 19-month peak against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell on fears the global economy was slowing.
MANUFACTURING SLOWING
Consumer spending in the fourth quarter could also get a boost from a surge in demand for utilities in November. 
In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production rebounded 0.6 percent last month after falling 0.2 percent in October.
Industrial output was driven by a 3.3 percent surge in utilities production as an unseasonably cold November boosted demand for heating. Mining production rose 1.7 percent. 
But manufacturing output was unchanged after dipping in October, indicating that obstacles remain for the economy despite consumers' exuberance.
""We expect to see continued softening in the pace of manufacturing growth in the coming year, as both U.S. and global growth slow and the dollar remains a headwind for exporters,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Overall retail sales, however, rose only 0.2 percent in November as cheaper gasoline undercut sales at service stations. Gasoline prices have dropped about 40 cents per gallon since October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Oil prices have fallen by a third since the start of October amid concerns about oversupply and cooling global growth. 
Retail sales increased by an upwardly revised 1.1 percent in October. They were previously reported to have surged 0.8 percent.
Sales at service stations tumbled 2.3 percent last month, the biggest drop since May 2017, after rising 3.2 percent in October. Auto sales gained 0.2 percent after accelerating 1.5 percent in the prior month. 
Sales at building material stores slipped 0.3 percent.
Receipts at clothing stores dropped 0.2 percent after jumping 1.3 percent in October. The drop in clothing sales probably reflects deep discounting by retailers seeking to lure shoppers.
Online and mail-order retail sales surged 2.3 percent, the largest gain in a year, after increasing 0.8 percent in October. 

Receipts at furniture stores rebounded 1.2 percent. Sales at electronics and appliance stores increased 1.4 percent. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores increased 0.4 percent. But sales at restaurants and bars fell 0.5 percent after rising 0.6 percent in October.

The manufacturing PMI dropped to 53.9 in December, compared to 55.3 a month earlier.

A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
“The flash PMIs bring signs of the U.S. economy ending 2018 on a softer note. With business activity expanding at the slowest rate for one and a half years, the surveys indicate that the pace of economic growth has faded to 2.0% in December, albeit closer to 2.5% for the fourth quarter as a whole,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson commented.
“The surveys reveal greater caution in relation to spending amid uncertainty about the economic outlook, linked in part to growing geopolitical concerns and trade wars(…) Price pressures have meanwhile cooled as lower oil prices feed through, yet rising tariffs remain a concern for many companies, keeping input cost inflation above the survey’s long-run average,” he added."

“The central bank will consider further key rate increases based on inflation and economic dynamics relative to forecasts, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets,” the central bank said in a statement.
The key interest rate was increased by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent, according to the statement. The decision was forecast by 16 of 42 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, with the rest predicting a hold. Regular foreign-currency purchases that were suspended to stem a slide in the ruble earlier this year will resume from Jan. 15, the regulator said.
The move will give extra protection to the ruble as it heads into a potentially tumultuous quarter after a more-than 13 percent plunge this year. The purchases could add to pressure from the ongoing threat of more U.S. sanctions. Inflation is edging closer to the central bank’s 4 percent target and will spike next quarter after a value-added tax increase kicks in.
“They’ve opted for a defensive hike, which will leave room to cut again in September-December,” said Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at the Russian Direct Investment Fund. “It’s clearly good news for the ruble.”
Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a news conference at 3 p.m. in Moscow.
The ruble pared a decline after the rate announcement, trading 0.2 percent weaker at 66.3625 per dollar. The yield on Russia’s 10-year local-currency bonds was unchanged at 8.7 percent.
Annual inflation accelerated for a sixth month to 3.9 percent as of December 10, edging close to the central bank’s target of 4 percent, the central bank said in today’s statement. It may reach 5.2 percent by the end of March, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The resumption of FX purchases “will contain any strengthening of the ruble,” said Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Helsinki. “Given the current uncertainty in external factors and the central bank’s conservatism, at least one hike in 2019 is highly likely.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business ended the year on a weak note, expanding at the slowest pace in over four years as new order growth all but dried up, hurt by trade tensions and violent protests in France, a survey showed on Friday.
The downbeat figures come a day after the European Central Bank decided to end its lavish asset-buying scheme but otherwise kept policy broadly unchanged, promising protracted stimulus for an economy struggling with an unexpected slowdown and political turmoil.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index slumped to 51.3, its weakest since November 2014, from a final November reading of 52.7, well below even the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll where the median expectation was for a modest rise to 52.8. 
""It's a relatively gloomy picture to end the year on. It's clear the underlying rate of growth has slowed further, and it is broad-based across manufacturing and services,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the PMI indicated the bloc's economy would expand 0.2-0.3 percent this quarter - and probably toward the lower end - slower than the 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters poll this week. [ECB/INT]
Suggesting there won't be much of a pick up when 2019 begins, an index measuring new business fell to a four-year low of 50.7 from November's 52.3, skating closer to the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. 
New export business, which includes trade between member countries, contracted for a third month.
A PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry sank to 51.4 from November's 53.4, well below even the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll for 53.5.
Slowing growth came despite service firms increasing their prices at the weakest rate in seven months. The output price index fell to 52.4 from 52.8.
Manufacturing growth also unexpectedly slowed. The factory PMI fell to 51.4 from 51.8 in November, missing the 51.9 predicted in a Reuters poll and its lowest reading since February 2016.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, nudged up to 51.0 from 50.7. The November reading was the lowest since mid-2013.
But with orders falling and backlogs of work being run down, optimism waned among factory managers. The future output index dropped to a six-year low of 56.0 from 56.3.

""There isn't much to pin hopes of faster growth on,"" Williamson said.

Economists had forecast a reading of 53.5.
The manufacturing PMI fell to 51.4 compared to expectations for 51.9 and from 51.8 a month earlier.

IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 52.2 from 52.3 in the previous month.
The index has dropped eight times in 2018, including in the final four months of the year, as the economy cools due to one-off effects like car registration bottlenecks as well as more lasting headwinds from trade frictions.
Markit economist Chris Williamson said he expected the economy to grow by 0.2 percent in the final quarter after a contraction in the July-September period.
He said that while the economy was not facing an immediate risk of recession, the outlook remains gloomy, especially as the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union next year without an agreement on future relations lurks on the horizon.
""The risk of a recession has increased, but we still don't see this happening in our projections,"" said Williamson.
Bottlenecks in new car registrations due to the introduction of stricter pollution standards, and a drought that caused disruptions to ferried deliveries of fuel and other raw materials have weighed on the German economy.
Clearing the vehicle registration bottlenecks and getting traffic on major waterways back to normal would provide a much-needed impetus for the economy, Williamson said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said that its composite purchasing mangers index dropped to 49.3 points from 54.2 in November, sliding below the 50-point threshold between contraction and expansion for the first time since June 2016.
The reading, the lowest since November 2014, also fell far short of economists' average expectation for 54.0 in a Reuters poll.
Companies have seen business drop after nearly a month of nationwide demonstrations that have triggered the most violent street protests seen in decades.
The ""yellow vest"" movement, named after the high-vis vests French motorists must keep in their cars, started as a rebellion against since-scrapped fuel tax hikes into a broader movement against the high cost of living.
""The protests have been a major factor for growth to slow from what was a very resilient picture before,"" IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said, noting that the tourism and leisure sectors were hit particularly hard.
He added that France was on course for growth of only 0.2 percent in the final quarter of the year, in line with the central bank's estimate and down from 0.4 percent the previous quarter.
Neither the services nor the manufacturing sectors were spared drops into contraction territory, and the dominant service sector saw activity reverse particularly sharply.
The sector saw one of its biggest monthly drops on record with its activity index plunging to 49.6 from 55.1 in November, well below economists' average expectation for 54.8.
The index for the smaller manufacturing sector slipped to 49.7 from 50.8, against expectations for the index to edge down to 50.7.
Companies saw client demand weaken across the board with new orders the lowest since August 2016 in manufacturing and new business for services providers the weakest since February of that year.
IHS Markit said that in contrast to services, manufacturers more often blamed weakness in the automotive sector for slumping output than the protests.
However, manufacturers reported a deterioration in delivery times as protesters manned road blocks on and off across the country, snarling up their supply chains.

The gap for November was seen at $830 million, according to the median forecast of 12 analysts, about half of October's revised deficit of $1.77 billion.
Authorities in Southeast Asia's largest economy have taken measures to control imports after soaring bills in the middle of this year widened the country's current account deficit and hurt the rupiah exchange rate . 
The measures range from raising import tariffs and delaying big, import-heavy infrastructure projects, to a 175 basis point increase in the central bank's key policy rate.
Analysts in the poll estimated import growth to slow to 10.50 percent in November from a year earlier, compared to October's annual increase of 23.99 percent.
However, exports were still expected to remain sluggish with a 3.95 percent year-over-year growth in November, slower than a revised 4.21 percent increase in October.
""Indonesia's persistent trade deficit remains the main negative for the rupiah,"" ING said in a note, adding that its expectation that the deficit would shrink to $1.6 billion in November ""should be some relief for the central bank"".
Portfolio inflows have helped the rupiah strengthened over the past weeks, though it is still down about 7 percent against the dollar this year.

Retail sales grew 8.1% year on year, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, compared with the median forecast of 8.8%. The growth was the weakest pace since 2003, according to Reuters’ records.
Meanwhile, growth in industrial output also dipped half a percentage point to notch a year-on-year rise of 5.4%, lower than the 5.9% that markets projected.
On the other hand, fixed-asset investment grew 5.9% from January to November, marginally higher than the previous expected 5.8%.
The weak Chinese data came amidst a yet unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
However, there have been signs of progress in the U.S.-China talks since this month as China appeared to be taking more steps to ease tension with the U.S.
Beijing promised to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. automobiles and postpone some targets of its ambitious plans to dominate high-end technologies, the “Made in China 2025” plan, by 10 years.
The “Made in China 2025” is a strategic plan announced in May 2015. The plan aims to lessen China’s dependency on imported technology and has been a main target in Trump’s trade war.

Real estate investment, which mainly focuses on the residential sector but includes commercial and office space, rose 9.3 percent in November from a year earlier, accelerating from 7.7 percent in October, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday.
Also on Friday, China reported retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years in November.
For the first 11 months, property investment increased 9.7 percent from the year-earlier period, the same percentage as in January-October. In the previous months, the percentage increase had dropped for three months.
The upbeat headline number for November was largely buoyed by more construction starts. Measured by floor area, such starts surged 21.7 percent from a year earlier, up from 14.7 percent in October, according to Reuters calculations.
""After busy land acquisition under high leverage early this year, developers now are rushing to launch new construction and kick off presales in hopes to collect cash as quick as possible as financing pressure mounts,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
In China, the sales process usually begins soon after construction starts, and historically most apartments are sold before they are completed.
However, after strong growth in 2016 and 2017, sales have been subdued this year, on the back of tighter controls to cool property prices.
CAUTIOUS BUYERS 
As worries about the economy increase, potential home buyers tend to grow more cautious about spending.
In November, property sales by floor area, a major indicator of demand, fell 5.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with October's 3.1 percent drop. In the first 11 months, property sales by area rose 1.4 percent from a year earlier, official data showed. 
Analysts predict the softer sales will constrain price growth in coming months, dampening developers' appetite for front-loading construction.
In another sign of cooling sentiment, China's land market has been less vigorous in the second half of 2018, with land sale premiums narrowing and failed auctions surging, suggesting developers have turned more cautious as liquidity condition deteriorates.
Failed land auctions in China's 300 cities totaled 618 cases by the end of November, according to state-run China News Service, more than double 2017's number. 
Funds raised by China's real estate developers in the first 11 months grew 7.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, compared with 7.7 percent in January-October, the NBS data showed.
Some property companies, such as  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) and Times China Holdings (HK:1233), recently sold bonds at double-digit yield, underlining the rising financing they face. 
A Reuters poll this week showed property investment would slow to 4 percent in 2019, while housing sales are expected to fall 5 percent amid slowing economic activity and tough financing conditions for smaller developers.
The softening in the housing market adds to the rising headwinds facing the world's second-largest economy, which is trying to ward off a sharp slowdown amid a bitter trade war with the United States.
Most economists expect China's local governments to relax restrictions on buyers in 2019 as their revenue from real property market shrinks.

But firms expect conditions to worsen three months ahead, the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" quarterly survey for December showed on Friday, suggesting that the Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing Chinese demand could weigh on next year's spending plans.
Separate data on Friday showed Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in December, though export orders contracted at the fastest pace in more than two years in a sign of weakening overseas demand.
The mixed batch of data underscores the challenges the Bank of Japan faces as heightened risks keep it from exiting its radical stimulus while a lack of policy ammunition makes it difficult to battle headwinds with additional easing.
""The solid tankan results probably diminished any speculation the BOJ could ease further amid slowing global growth and adjustments in stock prices,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""The BOJ is in no position to tighten any time soon either. We expect monetary policy to be on hold at least until the end of fiscal 2020.""
The tankan's headline gauge of big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 19, unchanged from three months ago and beating a median market forecast of plus 17, the tankan survey showed.
The index for non-manufacturers rose to plus 24 from plus 22 in the September survey, exceeding a market forecast of plus 21 and improving for the first time in two quarters.
Both manufacturers and non-manufacturers were more pessimistic about the business outlook three months ahead, a sign they are only just starting to feel the pinch from global trade tensions.
Still, big firms plan to raise capital spending by 14.3 percent in the business year to March 2019, revised up from the previous survey and beating market forecasts of a 12.7 percent increase.
""Capital expenditure turned out solid probably because firms see the need to invest in cutting-edge technology to stay competitive and deal with labor shortages,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But you can't rule out the possibility of a downward revision in spending plans, depending on the outlook for global trade and Japan's exports,"" he said.
GLOOMY PICTURE AHEAD
The survey will be among the various data points the BOJ will scrutinize at its two-day rate review next week, when it is widely expected to keep monetary policy steady.
Japan's economy shrank an annualized 2.5 percent in the third quarter, suffering the worst slump in over four years, as a string of natural disasters cooled consumer sentiment and disrupted factory output.
Many analysts expect growth to have rebounded in the current quarter. But global trade frictions and a slowdown in China have raised risks to Japan's export-driven economy.
A rebound in domestic demand, which has been hit by a string of natural disasters during the summer, helped lift non-manufacturers' sentiment and softened the blow from tougher external conditions, the December tankan showed.
But sentiment worsened for machinery makers and automakers, which are industries more directly affected by China's slowdown.
Japanese machine tool orders to China slumped 36.5 percent in October from a year earlier to mark the eighth straight month of declines, data by an industry body showed last month.
The softening demand is already crimping earnings growth at Japanese machinery makers like Yaskawa Electric Corp (T:6506), Fanuc Corp (T:6954) and Canon Inc (T:7751).
Most companies are only likely to firm up their capital expenditure plans for the next fiscal year at the start of 2019. That means the next BOJ tankan, due early April, will give a better picture on how the trade woes affect corporate spending appetite, analysts say.

""Big firms' capital spending came out strong reflecting the yen's weakening and falling oil prices. As such temporary factors fade away, however, corporate sentiment may turn for the worse given a slowdown in the world economy and the fear of a trade war,"" said Kuwahara of Nomura Securities.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 09:36PM ET</span>","China's November retail sales, industrial output growth weakens sharply","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as domestic demand softened further, underlining rising risks to the economy as China works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States.
The world's second-largest economy has been loosing momentum in recent quarters as a multi-year government campaign to curb shadow lending put increasing financial strains on companies in a blow to production and investment.
The stresses on broad activity have been compounded by a sharp escalation in China's trade dispute with the United States, which has threatened to fracture global supply chains, chill investment, exports and growth.
Retail sales rose 8.1 percent in November from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday, below expectations for an 8.8 percent rise and the slowest since May 2003. In October, sales increased 8.6 percent.
Industrial output rose 5.4 percent in November, missing analysts' estimates and matching the rate of growth seen in January-February 2016. Factory output had been expected to grow 5.9 percent, unchanged from October's pace.
Over the weekend, China reported far weaker than expected November exports and imports, reflecting slower global demand and waning domestic factory activity as profit margins narrow.
With economic growth at its weakest since the global financial crisis, Chinese policymakers are ramping up spending, pushing banks to increase lending and cutting taxes to shore up businesses and ward off a more damaging slump.
A temporary 90-day trade war truce agreed by the United States and China early this month may have removed some of the immediate pressure on the economy. Yet even in the unlikely event the world's top two economies reach a durable resolution in their dispute, ebbing domestic demand, mounting household debt and a cooling real estate sector point to a further slowdown in growth next year.
China's fixed-asset investment growth quickened to 5.9 percent in the January-November period.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to rise 5.8 percent in the first 11 months of the year, edging up marginally from 5.7 percent in January-October.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.7 percent in January-November, compared with an increase of 8.8 percent in the first 10 months.

Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","Japan December manufacturing, output expand but export orders contract: flash PMI","TOKYO, (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity has expanded in December, a preliminary survey showed on Friday, but export orders have contracted at the fastest pace in more than two years, a worrying sign of weakening overseas demand.
The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 52.4 in December from a final 52.2 in November.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 28th consecutive month.
The flash index for output rose to 53.7, the highest level in eight months, from a final 52.4 for November. 
However, the index for export orders fell to a preliminary 48.0 in December from a final 50.8 in the previous month, experiencing sharpest contraction since August 2016.
Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said that based on PMI data so far in the fourth quarter, ""the case for a year-end rebound in gross domestic product looks strong"". 
But the survey data ""does bring some cautious undertones to the fore"" he said, noting the sharp decline in export orders and how total demand ""picked up only modestly"".
The survey also showed that business optimism weakened for a seventh consecutive month, suggesting that risks posed by trade protectionism and a slowdown in overseas economies are weighing on corporate sentiment.
On Dec. 1, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a truce that delayed a planned U.S. increase of tariffs on Chinese goods.
However, it is uncertain whether the world's two-largest economies can settle their differences on trade practices.
Data last weekend showed a sharp slowdown in growth of Chinese imports and exports in November, underscoring the threat trade friction poses to China's economy.

Japan's export-oriented economy is sensitive to changes in global demand and remains vulnerable if trade friction between the United States and China escalates next year.

(Reuters) - New vehicle sales in the United States are expected to drop next year as higher interest rates and rising prices could prompt customers to hold off their car-buying plans, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) said on Thursday.
The dealer lobby estimated sales of 16.8 million units for 2019, saying this would be the first time since 2014 that U.S. new vehicle sales could fall below the 17-million mark.
""If incentives continue to go down and interest rates go up, it will put tremendous pressure on consumers with rising monthly payments,"" NADA Chairman Wes Lutz said in a statement. ""The level of interest rates moving forward will be a wild card.""
Auto sales in 2018 benefited from President Donald Trump's overhaul of the U.S. tax code that put more money in the hands of the consumers.

""We're not going to have that again in 2019,"" NADA senior economist Patrick Manzi said. ""That's one of the main reasons we're expecting new vehicle sales to fall off slightly.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits tumbled to near a 49-year low last week, which could ease concerns about a slowdown in the labor market and economy.
Other data on Thursday showed import prices dropping by the most in more than three years in November as the cost of petroleum products tumbled and a strong dollar weighed on prices of other goods, pointing to subdued imported inflation.
Tightening labor market conditions bolster expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Dec. 18-19 policy meeting. With inflation likely to remain tame through the first half of 2019, economists see fewer rate hikes next year.
The Fed has increased borrowing costs three times this year.
""Markets can breathe a sigh of relief that the economy is not going all wobbly,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""No inflation pressures building and a tight labor market is news that tells the Fed they are right to continue to raise interest rates at next week's meeting.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 27,000 to a seasonally adjusted 206,000 for the week ended Dec. 8, the Labor Department said. The decline in applications, which was the largest since April 2015, was likely exaggerated by difficulties adjusting the data around this time of the year.
Claims hit 202,000 in mid-September, which was the lowest level since December 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 225,000 in the latest week.
Claims shot up to an eight-month high of 235,000 during the week ended Nov. 24. The Labor Department said only claims for Virginia were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 224,750 last week.
While challenges smoothing the data around the Thanksgiving holiday likely boosted applications in prior weeks, there were fears the labor market was losing momentum given financial market volatility, the fading stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy.
Last week's sharp drop in claims also suggests a slowdown in job growth in November was likely the result of worker shortages. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 155,000 jobs after surging by 237,000 in October.
""Seasonal adjustment can be challenging at this time of year, but this report should lessen fears that the labor market is weakening significantly,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
With the unemployment rate near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent, Fed officials view the labor market as being at or beyond full employment.
U.S. Treasury yields were mixed as investors digested moves by the European Central Bank to reduce growth and inflation forecasts for 2019. The dollar (DXY) rose slightly against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher.
SUBDUED IMPORTED INFLATION
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices dropped 1.6 percent last month, the biggest decline since August 2015, after an unrevised 0.5 percent increase in October.
Economists had forecast import prices decreasing 0.9 percent in November. In the 12 months through November, import prices rose 0.7 percent. That was the smallest annual increase since November 2016 and followed a 3.3 percent rise in October.
The report came on the heels of data showing weak overall producer and consumer inflation readings in November. It supports economists' expectations that inflation could remain moderate through the first half of 2019.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core PCE price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in October, the smallest gain since February, after rising 1.9 percent in the prior month.
It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in March for the first time since April 2012. Most economists expect the Fed will raise interest rates twice next year, although traders expect no more than one rate increase.
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants tumbled 11.0 percent after rising 3.2 percent in October. Prices for imported petroleum plunged 12.1 percent, the biggest drop since January 2016, after increasing 2.7 percent in October.
Oil prices have fallen by a third since the start of October amid concerns about oversupply and a slowing global economy.
Food prices declined 2.2 percent in November, reversing October's 2.2 percent gain. Excluding fuels and food, import prices fell 0.2 percent last month after being unchanged in October. The so-called core import prices rose 0.4 percent in the 12 months through November.
The weak core import price readings reflect the strong dollar, which has gained about 8.0 percent this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.
The import price data excludes tariffs, which economists say could understate any inflationary impact of the White House's trade war with China. The price of goods imported from China fell 0.1 percent in November.

""To the extent that tariffs are borne by foreign producers through narrower profit margins, we would see a drop in import prices even as U.S. consumers and producers are paying more for imported goods,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. borrowers filed the most loan requests to buy a home and to refinance one in two months as most lending costs declined to their lowest levels since September, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage applications increased 1.6 percent to 346.0 in the week ended Dec. 7. This was the strongest reading since the week of Oct. 5 when it was 346.7.
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate ""conforming"" mortgages with balances of $453,100 or less averaged 4.96 percent last week, the lowest level since the week of Sept. 28. They averaged 5.08 percent the prior week.
The weekly drop in the 30-year conforming mortgage rate was the steepest since March 2017.
Mortgage rates have fallen in step with U.S. Treasury yields due to worries about slowing economic growth, financial market volatility and trade tension between China and the United States.
Other home borrowing costs MBA tracks decreased by 8 basis points to 9 basis points from the week before.
Last week, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) declined by 16 basis points, which was the biggest weekly fall since October 2015. 
""Trade fears dominated investors’ concerns, and this was amplified by data released by the U.S. Commerce Department showing a widening trade deficit,” Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
Kan was referring to government data released last Thursday that showed the U.S. trade gap deteriorated to its worst level in 10 years in October.
Falling mortgage rates rekindled submission of loan requests for home purchase and refinancing.
MBA's seasonally adjusted index on purchase loan applications, a proxy on future housing activity, rose for a fourth straight week to 256.1, its strongest reading since the week of July 6.
Higher interest rates, together with rising home prices, have raised the cost of buying a home. 
In the third quarter, monthly mortgage payments for first-time U.S. homebuyers grew by 15 percent year-over-year, according to a report from Genworth Mortgage Insurance released on Wednesday.
From January to September, first-time homeowners bought 1.58 million single-family homes, the most in the first nine months of the year since 2005, Genworth said.
Meanwhile, MBA's barometer on refinancing climbed further from a near 18-year trough reached three weeks earlier. It rose 1.8 percent from the previous week to 851.6.

The share of refinancing applications grew to 41.5 percent last week, the biggest since March and larger than 40.4 percent the prior week, MBA said.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 11:28AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices flat; underlying inflation firm,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in November, held back by a sharp decline in the price of gasoline, but underlying inflation pressures remained firm amid rising rents and healthcare costs.
The strength in underlying inflation reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday supports views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Dec. 18-19 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank has hiked rates three times this year. 
But with oil prices tumbling, financial market conditions tightening and economic growth slowing, some economists believe the Fed could settle for fewer rate increases in 2019.
""The inflation picture is still fairly tame, certainly not heating up enough to push the Fed to a more aggressive stance,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""After next week's expected hike, look for the Fed to raise rates only a couple of times in 2019.""
November's flat reading in the Consumer Price Index, which was the weakest in eight months, followed a 0.3 percent increase in October. In the 12 months through November, the CPI rose 2.2 percent, the smallest gain since February, after advancing 2.5 percent in October.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2 percent, matching October's gain. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core CPI to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in October.
Last month's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations.
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, weighed down by upbeat news from Europe. U.S. Treasury prices slipped, while stocks on Wall Street rallied on optimism that a bitter trade fight between the United States and China would soon be resolved.
BENIGN OUTLOOK
Despite the firmness in core consumer prices, the overall inflation outlook is benign amid falling oil prices and signs of slowing economic growth both in the United States and overseas.
A report on Tuesday showed producer prices edging up 0.1 percent in November after accelerating 0.6 percent in October.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core PCE price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.8 percent year-on-year in October, the smallest gain since February, after rising 1.9 percent the prior month. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in March for the first time since April 2012.
Economists expect the core PCE price index to hover below that target for much of 2019, which they say could see the Fed temporarily halting interest rates hikes. 
Minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting published last month showed nearly all officials agreed another rate hike was ""likely to be warranted fairly soon,"" but also opened debate on when to pause further monetary policy tightening.
Traders expect no more than one rate increase in 2019, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. In its last forecasts in September, the Fed projected three rate hikes in 2019.
""The recent softening in core (PCE) inflation ... does suggest that the Fed won't hesitate to move to the sidelines if activity growth begins to slow more sharply,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics in London.
In November, gasoline prices tumbled 4.2 percent after rebounding 3.0 percent in October. With oil prices falling sharply since October, gasoline could become even cheaper. Brent crude oil prices have dropped almost 30 percent.
Food prices rose 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in October. Food consumed at home gained 0.2 percent in November after dropping for two straight months.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3 percent in November after a similar gain in October. 
Healthcare costs jumped 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in October. There were strong increases in the costs of hospital services and prescription medication. Americans also paid more for recreation as well as for water and sewer, and trash collection services.
But they got some relief from apparel prices, which dropped 0.9 percent after ticking up 0.1 percent in October. There were also decreases in the prices of wireless telephones services, airline fares and motor vehicle insurance. 

New motor vehicle prices were unchanged in November after two straight monthly declines. The cost of used motor vehicles and trucks increased for a second straight month.

541,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 08:34AM ET</span>",U.S. Annual Retail Inflation Slows in November,"Investing.com – U.S. consumer price growth slowed in November, underlining arguments for the Federal Reserve to take a pause in monetary policy tightening after the rate hike expected at its meeting next week.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its consumer price index (CPI) was unchanged from a month earlier, slowing from the 0.3% increase seen in November.
Analysts had forecast a 0.1% increase.
In the 12 months through November, inflation rose 2.2%, in line with expectations and down from 2.5% in October.
Core CPI, a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.2% from a month earlier, matching consensus and the prior increase. The annual increase in the core CPI was 2.2%, also in line with analysts’ estimates.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Economists currently expect the Fed to move ahead with a quarter-point increase of interest rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Dec. 19, though skepticism over the outlook for 2019 has grown on the back of concerns about a slowdown in the global economy.
Markets are currently pricing in just one rate hike for next year, as policymakers have recently shown a more dovish stance.
Traders will pay close attention to next week’s decision, which includes an update to the Fed’s economic projections, including interest rate forecasts in the dot-plot, as well as a follow-up press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell."

544,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>","Australia Growth to Be Hit by Housing ‘Perfect Storm,’ AMP Says","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s tumbling property prices could shave up to 1.2 percentage points from economic growth in 2019 as the decline hits housing construction and consumer spending, according to AMP Capital Investors Ltd.
Sydney and Melbourne prices will drop a further 10 percent next year, taking their peak-to-trough fall to 20 percent as a “prefect storm” smacks housing, AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver said in a research report Wednesday. He predicts the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates in the second half of 2019 and end the year with a cash rate at 1 percent from the current 1.5 percent.
“The positive feedback loop of recent years of rising prices bringing higher demand and further price gains has given way to a negative feedback loop of falling prices leading to reduced demand and further declines,” Oliver said of housing. “This could all be made worse if immigration levels are cut sharply.”
Sydney’s property market slump has reached a new milestone, with values falling further than the late 1980s when Australia was on the cusp of entering its last recession. The downturn in Australia’s most populous city is accelerating as tighter mortgage lending standards crimp the amount people can borrow and as nervous buyers sit on the sidelines.
Oliver said while the price falls in Australia are not on the scale of the property crashes in the U.S. and Europe during the 2008 financial crisis, the property downturn “will have a significant economic impact” Down Under:
“Rate cuts won’t be aimed at re-inflating the property market but supporting households with a mortgage to offset the negative wealth impact on spending,” Oliver said, estimating a quarter-point cut would save a household with a A$400,000 mortgage about A$1,000 a year. “Banks will likely have no choice to pass the cuts on given the bad publicity not passing them on will generate.”"

546,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>",EU to act on derivatives clearing in case of no-deal Brexit: document,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is set to implement a commitment to avoid disruption in the cross-border derivatives market if Britain crashes out of the bloc next March without a deal, an EU document showed on Tuesday.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's decision on Monday to delay a parliamentary vote on Britain's divorce settlement with the EU has increased the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.
This would leave EU customers cut off from UK-based market operators if no contingency measures were in place.
The divorce settlement would allow cross-border financial services to continue uninterrupted after March until the end of 2020.
The EU's executive European Commission had already said it would adopt contingency measures in case of a no-deal Brexit. The Bank of England had called on the EU to act on this pledge as a matter of urgency, and the document signals that Brussels is now ready to act.
It will come as a relief to clearing houses in Britain that must decide this month whether to tell EU customers to shift derivatives positions worth billions of euros from London.
The London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) LCH unit clears over 90 percent of euro-denominated interest rate swaps used by companies across Europe to insulate themselves against adverse moves in borrowing costs.
ICE Clear (N:ICE) is also affected.
The draft ""implementing decision"" says that a ""disorderly close-out"" of derivatives positions may pose risks to financial stability.
""To prevent such risks, it is justified...to provide clearing services for a limited period of time,"" the document says. The exact length of time has not been filled in.
A ""precondition"" for a more permanent access to the EU market is what sort of trading relationship Britain will have with the bloc after Brexit, said the document, first reported by the Financial Times.
The draft decision sets stringent conditions for granting temporary ""equivalence"" or market access to EU customers, saying the bloc's regulators must be able to see the inner workings of clearers in a non-EU country.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the bloc's markets watchdog, should have access to ""all information requested"" on clearers in Britain on an ""on-going"" basis.
The exchange of information should include sensitive matters such as setting margins or how much cash customers of clearing houses should post to back their trades, and how they are ""calibrated"" in market crises.
ESMA should be allowed to share the information with the European Central Bank, and the approval to continue clearing would be ""reviewed"" if these conditions were not met, it added.
A revision of the bloc's derivatives rules now being approved already include the tougher terms for granting market access to foreign clearing houses that have provoked sharp criticism from U.S. regulators.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 01:23PM ET</span>","Germany cuts GDP growth forecast for 2018, sees up to 1.6 percent","BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Tuesday cut its economic growth forecast for this year as Economy Minister Peter Altmaier predicted an economic expansion of around 1.5 to 1.6 percent, below his previous forecast of 1.8 percent.
The German economy, Europe's largest, has shifted into a lower gear as Britain's looming departure from the European Union and trade conflicts sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies cause business uncertainty.
""Growth somewhat slowed in the past months as it did in many other countries,"" Altmaier told members of Germany's foreign press association in Berlin. ""For the year as a whole, we'll have growth of around 1.5 percent to 1.6 percent.""
But the government expects the economic upswing to continue and enter its 10th year of expansion in 2019, he added.
In April, the German government had predicted economic growth of 2.3 percent for this year. In October, Berlin reduced its growth forecast to 1.8 percent.
Altmaier called the rise of populism the biggest risk in Europe, pointing to violent street protests in France. The minister said that trade tensions were also a threat.
""With concern, we see the trade conflict between the United States and China, and we hope that it will be solved,"" Altmaier said. ""We also hope that the trade tensions between Europe and the U.S. can also be solved.""
In addition to the trade disputes, German exporters are also struggling with a more general slowdown of foreign demand as the global economy cools.
Due to low borrowing costs, record-high employment and inflation-busting pay hikes, domestic demand has become an important source of expansion in Germany in recent years.

However, private consumption was weak over the summer months, with household spending holding back overall economic growth in the third quarter for the first time since 2013.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices rise; oil likely to slow momentum,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices unexpectedly rose in November as increases in the costs for services offset a sharp decline for energy products, but the overall momentum in wholesale inflation appears to be slowing.
With oil prices down sharply since October, inflation at the factory gate is likely to slow further in the coming months. The report on Tuesday did not change expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Dec. 18-19 policy meeting. The central bank has hiked rates three times this year.
""All systems are go for a fourth rate hike this year when Fed officials meet next week,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""In many economic cycles over the last twenty to thirty years, a spike in energy prices was the spark that led to the inflation fire, and right now there is no energy price inflation to be seen.""
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1 percent last month after jumping 0.6 percent in October. In the 12 months through November, the PPI rose 2.5 percent, slowing from October's 2.9 percent surge.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI to be unchanged in November and rise 2.5 percent year-on-year.
But underlying producer inflation remains firm. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.3 percent last month. 
The so-called core PPI gained 0.2 percent in October. In the 12 months through November, the core PPI increased 2.8 percent, matching October's gain.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, boosted by signs of progress to resolve the U.S.-China trade dispute, which has roiled financial markets for months. U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly and the dollar (DXY) firmed against a basket of currencies.
Inflation measures have generally been softening, partly because of oil prices, which have fallen sharply since October on signs of an economic slowdown. Brent crude oil prices have dropped almost 30 percent.
MODERATE INFLATION
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.8 percent in October. 
That was the smallest gain since February and followed a 1.9 percent increase in September. The core PCE price index hit the Fed's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.
Economists believe moderate inflation and expectations of slower economic growth could prompt the U.S. central bank to temporarily stop raising rates rate next year. 
Minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting published last month showed nearly all officials agreed another rate hike was ""likely to be warranted fairly soon,"" but also opened debate on when to pause further monetary policy tightening.
""The bar for inflation returning to 2 percent is fairly high,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""This may give the central bank reason to pause this tightening sometime next year.""
In November, wholesale energy prices tumbled 5.0 percent, the largest drop since September 2015. Gasoline prices plunged 14.0 percent, the biggest decline since February 2016, after surging 7.6 percent in the prior month.
Food prices shot up 1.3 percent last month, driven by jumps in the cost of chicken eggs and fresh and dry vegetables. Food prices rebounded 1.0 percent in October.
Overall, the cost of wholesale goods fell 0.4 percent in November, the largest drop since May 2017, after shooting up 0.6 percent in October. Core goods rose 0.3 percent last month after being unchanged in October.
The rise in core goods prices likely reflects the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on lumber, steel and aluminum imports, as well as on a range of Chinese goods. Last month, there were increases in the prices of machinery, iron and steel scrap as well as steel mill products.
The cost of services increased 0.3 percent in November, boosted by a 0.3 percent gain in the index for trade services, which measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services vaulted 0.7 percent in October.
The cost of healthcare services edged up 0.1 percent last month. There were increases in prices for hospital outpatient, hospital inpatient, dental and nursing home care. Healthcare prices increased 0.3 percent in October.

Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index.

The Labor Department said its producer price index increased 0.1% last month. In the 12 months through November, the PPI rose 2.5%.
Both readings were in line with consensus.
Core PPI increased by 0.3% from a month earlier and rose 2.7% in the 12 months through November.
Analysts had predicted core PPI to increase 0.1% month-on-month and 2.5% on an annualized basis.
Core PPI is a key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs.
The Federal Reserve keeps its eye on this data because, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer. In that sense, PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 08:13AM ET</span>",Foreign investors spurn U.S. Treasuries as curve threatens to invert,"By Tomo Uetake and Saikat Chatterjee
TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - A worrying sign of inversion in the U.S. Treasury bond curve is dulling the appeal of the developed world's highest-yielding bond market for foreign investors.
Overseas investors are reviewing their investments or shunning Treasuries as rates at the short end rise above those at the longer end and make it unprofitable for holders of these bonds to hedge their currency risks.
The difference between short- and long-term bond rates, or the yield curve, has contracted in recent weeks as rising U.S. interest rates meet growing doubts the world's biggest economy may be slowing down, weighing on longer-dated yields.
And as short-term yields move higher than longer-term yields, the cost of hedging exposure to the U.S. dollar has gone up.
""There is the whole issue of hedging costs. That is the one thing that was inconsequential at the start of the year but now it is sizeable,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson in London, whose firm manages $378.1 billion in assets.  
""You are knocking off a substantial part of U.S. yields when you buy from the UK perspective and hedge back that exposure. When we buy government debt, we always hedge it. You don't want to take the FX risk,"" he said.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates eight times since late 2015 and looks set to hike them again next week even as other global central banks stay shy of normalizing policy, causing a significant gap to open up in short-dated interest rates.
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have both kept interest rates below zero percent, while the Bank of England has raised rates only twice from its record low near zero percent set in 2016 after the shock Brexit vote. 
As U.S. short-term rates climb, currency forward markets which are closely linked to the differences in interest rates between currencies have moved to price in the higher cost of holding dollars.
For yen-based investors, they must pay around 3.3 percent of their principal investment to hedge the risk of holding dollars. The picture is similar for euro-based investors.
""We won't buy U.S. Treasuries with currency hedge. The return would be negative after hedging,"" said Kazuyuki Shigemoto, general manager of investment planning at Dai-ichi Life Insurance, which oversees assets of 35.6 trillion yen ($316 billion). 
Currency hedge costs: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QNXZtq
Hedging costs erode rate advantage for U.S. debt: https://tmsnrt.rs/2SFGIzQ
Higher hedging costs would not have discouraged investors if longer-term bond yields had risen as much as short-term yields.
The yield on 10-year U.S Treasuries, however, has only risen to 2.8 percent compared with 2.1-2.3 percent before the start of the Fed's tightening in late 2015. Two-year yields have meanwhile risen 160 basis points, to 2.7 percent.
Last week, a section of the curve inverted when the five-year bond yield dropped below two-year and three-year yields.
Dai-ichi Life's Shigemoto believes it is only a matter of time before the two- and 10-year yield spread turns negative.
U.S. Yield Curve: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zUqXiW
Japanese and European investors hunting for yield among top-rated government bonds are starting to look elsewhere.
""We have seen a real decline in flows, especially from Japan in particular and a lot of them have been directed to European and even Asian assets,"" said Bob Michele, head of global fixed income at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, whose firm manages $491 billion in asset, in New York.
Even emerging markets are offering some value after a violent sell-off earlier this year on trade war concerns. 
A JPMorgan global emerging market bond index denominated in U.S. dollars now offers a yield of over 7 percent versus around 5.5 percent at the start of the year, Refinitiv data shows.
TO HEDGE OR NOT
One option is to give up currency hedging. Still, increasing the holding of dollars just when the Fed may be about to slow its pace of monetary tightening could be risky. 
""We want to buy dollars on dips. But an inverted yield curve may portend a future recession and there are many other uncertain factors. So we need to carefully look at economic fundamentals,"" said Toshinori Kurisu, deputy general manager of investment planning at Nippon Life, which has total assets of 66.7 trillion yen ($592 billion).
Institutional investors are reluctant to take on too much currency risk for regulatory reasons. The U.S.-China trade war and possible U.S. slowdown are also reasons for investors to lower, rather than raise, their risk exposure.
In that case, the ultimate choice appears to be going back to their home markets.
""The attraction of U.S. Treasuries investment with a full currency hedge has declined. So we have been buying investment grade corporate bonds in the hedged U.S. debt space,"" said Ryosuke Fukushima, general manager of investment planning at Japan Post Insurance, or Kampo, which has 76.8 trillion yen ($681.3 billion) of assets under management.
Fukushima said Kampo does not plan to radically change its stance because the firm is on course to meet its internal investment income target for the current financial year ending in March.
""But in the plan for next year, which we have just started contemplating, we will consider whether to flip back to JGBs from hedged foreign bonds, which we see as substitute for JGBs,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British workers received their biggest pay rise in a decade in the three months to October as the country's strong labor market showed no sign of weakening ahead of Brexit, official figures showed on Tuesday.
Average weekly earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.3 percent, their biggest increase since the three months to July, 2008 and comfortably beating a median forecast of 3.0 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
The Bank of England has said it will need to raise interest rates gradually to offset inflation pressures from the labor market, and forecast slower wage growth for the end of 2018 than Tuesday's official figures suggest. 
Britain's economy has slowed since the 2016 Brexit referendum but unemployment has continued to fall sharply, putting pressure on employers to raise pay.
Tuesday's figures showed unemployment remained close to its lowest level since the 1970s at 4.1 percent. 
""Finally, British worker' pay is starting to claw back some of the ground it's given up during the 'lost decade' since the financial crisis,"" Tom Stevenson, an investment director at fund managers Fidelity International, said.
""However ... we are still not out of the woods. With the ongoing political and economic uncertainty, the recent steps forward could be reversed. Britain's pay growth continues to lag our main competitors since the financial crisis,"" he added.
Total earnings, excluding bonuses, also rose by 3.3 percent in the three months to October, the Office for National Statistics said, the biggest rise since the end of 2008.
The proportion of the working-age population in a job returned to a record high 75.7 percent as the number of people in work rose by 79,000, more than any forecast in the Reuters poll.
Sterling and British share and government bond prices, which have reacted strongly to the progress and setbacks in Prime Minister Theresa May's attempts to steer Britain out of the European Union, were little changed by the data.
Stronger wage growth in Britain could help the economy as it prepares to leave the EU in March. 
Wages are rising more slowly than the 4 percent increases seen before the financial crisis. But real earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose by the fastest since the end of 2016, up 1.1 percent, in the three months to October.
How long that improvement in spending power lasts is likely to depend on May's ability to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

The pound will probably fall sharply -- pushing up inflation and hurting household budgets -- if Britain does not secure a transition deal to ease its way out of the EU.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings rebounded in October, but hiring continued to lag, suggesting a recent slowdown in job growth was most likely because employers could not find qualified workers.
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Monday underscored tightening labor market conditions, which economists say will encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week despite volatility in financial markets.
""This report continues to paint a picture of an increasingly tight labor market,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""It continues to signal that the Fed has fully met its employment objective.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 119,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.1 million. That lifted the job openings rate to 4.5 percent from 4.4 percent in September. There were 6.1 million people unemployed in October.
Hiring rose by 196,000 to 5.9 million, matching August's record high. The hiring rate increased to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in September. 
The government reported last Friday a slowdown in job growth in November, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 155,000 jobs. The economy created 237,000 jobs in October. With job openings outpacing the number of unemployed people, economists expect employment growth to continue slowing through 2019. 
""The bad thing about 7 million job openings and only 6 million unemployed is that the country is running out of workers and this will eventually slow economic growth within the next few years,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The labor market is strong at the moment ... and companies are begging for help to produce and sell their goods and services out there.""
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
There were 45,000 job openings in the information industry in October. The real estate and rental and leasing industry had 38,000 vacancies and there were 20,000 unfilled positions in educational services. State and local government education had 17,000 vacancies.
Hiring in October was driven by the transportation, warehousing, and utilities industry, which added 90,000 jobs. The manufacturing industry hired 43,000 workers. 
The worker shortage appeared to be more prevalent in the Midwest and the Northeast. 
Labor market tightness is marked by a 3.7 percent unemployment rate, which is the lowest in nearly 49 years and well below current Fed estimates of full employment at 4.5 percent.
The U.S. central bank has raised interest rates three times this year. The outlook for further rate hikes after the anticipated increase in borrowing costs at the Fed's Dec. 18-19 policy meeting is uncertain amid investor worries that economic growth might be slowing. Economists expect the jobless rate to drop to 3.4 percent in 2019.
""The labor market expansion will continue through 2019 but it will become increasingly more attenuated,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""Not only will the tight labor market constrain net hiring, but such factors as higher interest rates and the waning impact of fiscal stimulus will bear down on demand conditions.""
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs fell for a second straight month in October. The quits rate, which policymakers and economists view as a measure of job market confidence, dipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 2.3 percent in October.
Layoffs were little changed at 1.7 million in October, holding the layoffs rate at 1.1 percent. But recent data, including applications for unemployment benefits, have suggested a rise in layoffs in November.

""The JOLTS data lag many other labor market indicators, and some of the more recent changes, particularly in initial claims, have pointed to more noticeable weakening in the job market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast earlier this year that inflation would top 1 million percent in 2018 and 10 million percent next year. Monthly inflation decelerated to 144 percent in November from 148 percent the prior month and 233 percent in September, the National Assembly said in a report.
Socialist President Nicolas Maduro late last month increased the monthly minimum wage by 150 percent to 4,500 bolivars, fewer than $10 at the black market exchange rate. Citizens had complained that they could not afford basic items despite a previous 60-fold minimum wage increase in August.
The National Assembly has become the only reliable source for consumer price data since the government stopped publishing economic indicators years ago as falling oil prices sent activity tumbling. The IMF has been pressuring Venezuela to provide it with official economic data, sources said last month.

Maduro blames an 'economic war' waged by domestic business interests and the United States for Venezuela's woes. Critics point to his interventionist policies and printing of money to finance a wide fiscal deficit as the causes of hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods.

Gross domestic product growth in the three months to October slowed to 0.4 percent from an unusually robust 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2018, in line with a Reuters poll of economists.
However, the Office for National Statistics warned that the third-quarter growth data was at risk of being revised downwards, due to a big upwards revision in Britain's trade deficit for the three months to September. 
Compared with a year earlier, growth in October held at September's 1.5 percent, against expectations of a slight pick-up, while in October alone GDP rose by 0.1 percent as expected.
Monday's data confirm the British economy's strength in the third quarter of 2018 represented something of a blip, caused by a boost to consumer spending from an unusually warm summer.
More recent business surveys suggest Britain's economy is slowing sharply as businesses stall in the face of uncertainty about the terms on which the country will leave the European Union on March 29 next year.
A closely watched purchasing managers' index for November last week pointed to growth of just 0.1 percent in the final quarter of 2018.
Monday's data do not give updated details of business investment, which fell sharply in the three months to September. 
Britain's economy has slowed since the June 2016 Brexit vote, its annual growth rate slipping from top spot among the Group of Seven group of rich nations to vying with Japan and Italy for bottom place in the rankings.

Monday's data showed annual growth in Britain's dominant services sector picked up to 1.8 percent from 1.6 percent, but factory output recorded its largest fall since March 2016, down 1.0 percent on the year.

Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro zone slid to -0.3 from 8.8 in November, the lowest level since December 2014, and the fourth consecutive monthly drop. The slide far exceeded analysts' expectations of a dip to 8.1.
A sub-index on current conditions fell to 20.0 from 29.3 in November. A sub-index on expectations fell to -18.8 from -9.8 the previous month.

Gross domestic product grew 0.4% in the three months to October the ONS reported, slowing from the 0.6% expansion seen in the three months to September and in line with forecasts.
Manufacturing output shrank by 0.9% in October, the worst performance since March 2016, while the service sector grew by 0.2% and the construction sector shrank by 0.2%.
“GDP growth slowed going into the autumn after a strong summer, with a softening in services sector growth mainly due to a fall in car sales.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's massive property market is expected to cool further in 2019, with smaller price rises and falling home sales adding to pressure on the world's second-largest economy, a Reuters poll showed.
Smaller cities, which have seen sharper price gains this year, may face greater risks of a slump as economic activity slows and financing conditions remain tough for smaller developers.
China's average residential property prices are forecast to rise 2 percent in the first half of 2019 from a year earlier, and just 0.5 percent for the full year, a survey with 16 property analysts and economists showed on Monday.
That would mark the weakest annual rise in five years in a sector that traditionally has been one of the country's major growth drivers and store of household wealth.
Analysts have downgraded their estimates since the last Reuters poll was conducted in September, when prices were expected to rise 3.3 percent in the first six months of 2019.
Housing sales are expected to fall 5 percent in 2019, the latest poll showed, with property investment slowing to 4 percent.
China's real estate market directly impacts over 40 industries and highly correlates to domestic demand from steel to washing machines.
Despite gradually slowing from its peak levels in mid-2016 as authorities sought to cool price rises, the sector has remained relatively buoyant due to strong underlying demand for housing and few alternatives for investment.
October data showed new home prices rose 8.6 percent compared with a year earlier, the fastest pace since July last year.
Recent price gains have been mostly driven by smaller cities which have fewer restrictions on home buyers than megacities.
That has allowed smaller centers to get rid of years of high inventories, providing a cushion for the economy as regulators moved to rein in high levels of debt.
However, market sentiment has turned more cautious since the start of the second half of this year following a surge in failed land auctions, and on signs that China's consumers may be growing more cautious about spending.
""There will be a significant downside risk in real estate next year - it's mainly due to more visible contractions in smaller tier-3 and tier-4 cities,"" said Sun Binyi, an analyst with China Real Estate Appraisal.
The biggest risks facing the sector include smaller government allotments next year for a massive slum redevelopment program, tight financing faced by property developers and a chilling effect on confidence if the Sino-U.S. trade war drags on, Sun said.
Most economists believe China's regional and municipal governments will loosen curbs on buyers next year as their revenue from real estate shrinks and local economies slow.
But that will test central policymakers' resolve to keep debt levels and speculation under control.
Fourteen out of 16 analysts polled said they expected some degree of policy loosening in the sector in the coming year, though many argued it would be exercised in discretion and the likelihood of a blanket, nation-wide lift in purchase restrictions is low. 
""These tightening measures will be relaxed. As economic growth slows the government will need the housing market to support growth,"" said Iris Pang, ING Bank's Greater China economist based in Singapore. 
With domestic demand softening, economists predict China's growth could cool to as low as 6 percent in 2019, from an expected 6.5 percent this year, even if Washington and Beijing are able to negotiate an end to their trade war.
""We cannot rule out the possibility that the government starts to ease housing policies (in some cities) to support overall growth,"" said Tianjie He, senior economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
""But we think that China's policymakers are unlikely to do that unless the pressure on overall growth – particularly from the impact of the trade conflict with the United States – becomes significantly stronger than it currently is."" 

Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6, down from analysts' estimates of 7 in the last poll.

It said footfall on high streets, shopping centers and retail parks fell by 3.2 percent year-on-year last month - a twelfth consecutive month of decline.
""This year, amidst all of the other challenges facing retail, the drop in footfall of 3.2 percent in November was the largest of any November since Springboard started publishing footfall data in 2009,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing and insights director.
In the week of Black Friday (Nov. 23) itself footfall declined by 5.5 percent.
Wehrle said the decline was indisputable evidence that Black Friday delivered no tangible benefit to bricks and mortar stores.
A string of British store groups have gone out of business or announced shop closures this year as they battle subdued consumer spending, rising labor costs, higher property taxes, growing online competition and uncertainty over Brexit.
Last week industry data showed like-for-like retail sales fell 0.5 percent in November year-on-year - the biggest fall since October 2017 excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter.

Springboard is forecasting that footfall will decline by 4.2 percent in December, a greater drop than the 3.5 percent fall in December last year.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 12:06AM ET</span>",Japan's economy shrinks most in four years as global risks hit business spending,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese economy contracted the most in over four years in the third quarter as companies slashed spending, threatening to chill the investment outlook in 2019 as the export-reliant nation grapples with slowing global growth and trade frictions. 
The slump in the world's third-biggest economy adds to signs elsewhere in Asia and Europe of weakening momentum, with recent data in China and Australia showing a slowdown in growth and stoking concerns about the wider impact of the Sino-U.S trade war.
Japan's gross domestic product shrank at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in the July-September quarter - the worst downturn since the second quarter of 2014 - from 2.8 percent growth in the second quarter, revised data from the Cabinet Office showed. 
The slide, in part driven by a series of natural disasters that forced factories to cut production, was deeper than an initial estimate of a 1.2 percent contraction and against economists' median forecast for a 1.9 percent decline.
The capital expenditure component of GDP fell a sharp 2.8 percent from the second quarter, worse than the expected 1.6 percent decline and the preliminary reading of a 0.2 percent drop.
That was the biggest decrease since the third quarter of 2009, as wholesalers, retailers, and information and communications machinery cut spending, the Cabinet Office data showed.
""Capex is decelerating in areas such as all-purpose machinery, production equipment and automobiles,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Depending on extent of global slowdown and trade frictions, companies may put off their bullish spending plans or even make adjustments from the latter half of this fiscal year onwards.""
That risk - of businesses cutting back on spending - is a worry for policymakers who are counting on capital expenditure to boost growth and inflation. Capex has been a bright spot in the economy since late 2016, underpinned by investment in automation and labor-saving technology to cope with labor shortages.
The capex slump is particularly worrying as it comes at a time of cooling global growth, a rising tide of protectionism and slowing company profits, all of which are putting a damper on business confidence.
Japanese manufacturers' mood soured for a second straight month in December and is seen slipping further, a Reuters monthly poll showed on Thursday, pointing to declines in the central bank's key tankan survey due out Dec. 14.
DEMAND, INVESTMENT RISKS 
While analysts expect the economy to stage a rebound in the current quarter as factories lift production following the natural disasters, there are worries the Sino-U.S. trade war could crimp global growth and hurt export-led Japan. 
In October, Japanese robot maker Fanuc Corp (T:6954) - which is highly exposed to the China market - slashed its outlook for the full year, citing slower technology spending and trade friction.
Earnings growth at other Japanese manufacturers is also being crimped by the U.S.-China trade dispute, with Yaskawa Electric Corp (T:6506), and Canon Inc (T:7751) among companies that downgraded their profit forecasts, reflecting cooling demand.
The revised GDP figure translates into quarter-on-quarter contraction of 0.6 percent in real, price-adjusted terms, against a preliminary reading of a 0.3 percent slide and economists' median estimate of a 0.5 percent decline.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, fell 0.2 percent in July-September from the previous three months, versus 0.1 percent drop seen in the initial estimate.
Domestic demand shaved 0.5 percentage points off the revised GDP figure, while net exports - or exports minus imports - contributed minus 0.1 percentage point.
Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute, said global headwinds suggest business spending is on the verge of ""leveling off.""

""There may be a rebound in capex, but it cannot be a driver of the economy in the coming year, given growing uncertainty in the face of trade frictions, global economic slowdown and a planned sales tax hike at home.""

564,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 06:37AM ET</span>","China's November PPI up 2.7 percent year-on-year, CPI up 2.2 percent year-on-year","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory prices rose in November at their slowest pace since October 2016 as domestic demand lost further momentum, piling pressure on policymakers to unveil more measures to support the economy. 
Consumer inflation, meanwhile, eased from the previous month due to lower food prices, according to data published by the National Statistics Bureau on Sunday. 
The producer price index (PPI), a measure of the prices businesses receive for their goods and services, rose 2.7 percent in November from a year earlier, compared with a 3.3 percent increase in October, according to the statistics bureau. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected producer inflation - also used by economists as a sign of the trends in industrial profits - would cool to 2.7 percent last month.
On a monthly basis, the PPI fell 0.2 percent, down from a 0.4 percent gain in October. 
China reported its weakest factory activity in over two years in November as new orders slowed, while profit growth for industrial firms softened for six months in a row.
The slowdown in domestic demand has added to the list of economic worries for China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States, its biggest trading partner. 
Domestic demand for industrial goods and services has eased in recent months as Beijing's multi-year campaign to curb corporate debt and risky lending practices has crimped capital spending and corporate investment. 
Prices for raw materials increased 4.6 percent last month from a year earlier, down from a 6.7 percent rise in October. Price rises in the production and processing sector slowed in November from the previous month.
The uncertainty created by the trade war with the United States is hanging over China's economy, even though a week ago both sides agreed to a 90-day time-out. There are concerns that the tariff war could still escalate once the truce ends, putting more pressure on Chinese authorities to bolster the economy.
China's central bank has cut the level of cash that banks need to hold as reserves four times so far this year, in a bid to spur lending to businesses. Policymakers have also reduced taxes and pledged higher infrastructure spending. 
China's consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.2 percent in November from a year earlier, slowing from 2.5 percent in October and below expectations of 2.4 percent. The government's full-year target for consumer price inflation is 3 percent. 
On a month-on-month basis, the CPI fell 0.3 percent. 
The statistics bureau attributed the consumer inflation slowdown to a fall in food prices, due to the spread of swine fever. 
The food price index rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier in November, slowing from 3.3 percent in October. Non-food prices rose 2.1 percent, compared with 2.4 percent growth a month ago. 

The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.8 percent in November.

November exports only rose 5.4 percent from a year earlier, Chinese customs data showed on Saturday, the weakest performance since a 3 percent contraction in March, and well short of the 10 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.
Analysts say the export data showed that the ""front-loading"" impact as firms rushed out shipments to beat planned U.S. tariff hikes faded, and that export growth is likely to slow further as demand cools. 
The customs data showed that annual growth for exports to all of China's major partners slowed significantly. 
Exports to the United States rose 9.8 percent in November from a year earlier, compared with 13.2 percent in October.
To the European Union, shipments increased 6.0 percent, compared with 14.6 percent in October. Exports to South Korea fell from a year earlier, while in October they rose 7.7 percent.
SLOWEST IMPORT GROWTH SINCE 2016
Import growth was 3 percent, the slowest since October 2016, and a fraction of the 14.5 percent seen in the poll. Imports of iron ore fell for a second time, reflecting waning restocking demand at steel-mills as profit margins narrow.
""The sluggishness in imports and exports is in full swing,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist of Zhongyuan Bank in Beijing.
The soft imports ""show a relatively significant pullback in domestic demand"", he added.
In recent months, Chinese exports had expanded robustly, which economists said reflected front-loading of cargoes before a now-postponed plan to hike U.S. tariffs of $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent on Jan. 1.
The November trade numbers came out less than a week after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce delaying that tariff hike as they negotiate a trade deal. November's China numbers might add a sense of urgency. 
Stirring fears of a reignition of trade tension, the daughter of Huawei Technologies' founder, a top executive at the Chinese technology giant, was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 and faces extradition to the United States, threatening to drive a wedge between the U.S. and China.
TALKS 'GOING VERY WELL'
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday sounded an optimistic note about trade negotiations with China as his top economic advisers downplayed friction from the arrest of Meng Wanzhou. 
""China talks are going very well,"" Trump said on Twitter, without providing any details.
In a note, analysts at Haitong Securities in Shanghai said ""Growth in shipments of Chinese goods on U.S. 200 billion tariff list has started to pull back, indicating that frontloading effects may be starting to recede.""
""Now with U.S. and China agreeing not to escalate trade tensions any longer, China will start purchasing U.S. agricultural goods, which may narrow China-U.S. trade surplus in the future,"" they said.
China's November trade surplus with the United States was a record $35.55 billion. The October surplus was $31.78 billion. But China's imports from the U.S. in November fell 25 percent from a year earlier, while the annual decline in October was only 1.8 percent. 
For trade with all countries, China's surplus was $44.74 billion for November, compared with forecasts of $34 billion and October's surplus of $34.02 billion. 
On Thursday, the U.S. reported that its global trade deficit in October jumped to a 10-year high, and that the deficit with China surged 7.1 percent to a record $43.1 billion.
THE WEAKER YUAN 
Economists say one factor helping keep up Chinese exports this year is that the yuan  has weakened more than 5 percent against the dollar, helping to make Chinese products more competitive abroad.
Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office of brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai, said the weaker yuan ""should boost industrial exports over the coming months. Typically there is a six-month lag between the value of industrial export orders and currency movements.""
Economists in recent months have penciled in a deterioration in China's export outlook in 2019, factoring in higher U.S. tariffs on a wider range of Chinese goods. 
Chinese policymakers are expected to offer more policy support and deliver more support measures if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate.
China's central bank has cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves four times this year, as policymakers seek to steady the slowing economy amid the trade war with the United States.
The government aims for growth of around 6.5 percent this year, compared with 2017's 6.9 percent pace. 

Yang Yewei, an analyst at Southwest Securities in Beijing, said that as global demand cools, ""domestic growth-boosting measures should be more effective"".

For January-November, China's trade surplus with the United States was $293.52 billion, compared with about $251.26 billion in the same period last year.
China's large trade surplus with the United States has long been a sore point with Washington, and is at the center of a bitter dispute between the world's two biggest economies.
The two countries have hit each other with tit-for-tariffs on goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

In Argentina last weekend, Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. hike of tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal.

567,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 01:26PM ET</span>","U.S. job growth slows in November, monthly wage gains modest","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed in November and monthly wages increased less than forecast, suggesting some moderation in economic activity that could support expectations of fewer interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve in 2019.
The slowdown in hiring reported by the Labor Department on Friday is likely the result of worker shortages. The Fed in its ""Beige Book"" report this week said most business contacts in its 12 districts said ""that employment growth leaned to the slower side of a modest to moderate pace"" because of labor shortages.
The labor market is considered near or at full employment. 
Non-farm payrolls increased by 155,000 jobs last month, with construction companies hiring the fewest workers in eight months, likely because of unseasonably chilly temperatures. 
""This is still a solid gain that suggests economic growth is gradually slowing back towards its potential pace,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""There is nothing here to suggest the economy is suffering a more sudden downturn.""
The moderation in job gains in November also fits in with other data showing a rise in layoffs in recent weeks and a decline in a measure of services sector employment last month.
Data for September and October were revised to show 12,000 fewer jobs added than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 200,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate was unchanged at near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent as 133,000 people entered the labor force. 
Average hourly earnings rose six cents, or 0.2 percent in November. October wage gains were revised down to 0.1 percent from the previously reported 0.2 percent. In the 12 months through November, wages increased 3.1 percent, matching October's jump, which was the biggest gain since April 2009.
Companies also reduced hours for workers. The average workweek fell to 34.4 hours from 34.5 hours in October. 
The employment report comes on the heels of soft October data on the housing market, business spending on equipment as well as a jump in the trade deficit to a 10-year high that have heightened concerns over the economic expansion that is in its ninth year, the second longest on record.
Growth forecasts for the fourth quarter are around a 2.7 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter. Fears about the economy's health were stoked by a steep sell-off on Wall Street and a partial inversion of the U.S. yield curve. 
Following the employment report, U.S. financial markets continued to price in one rate hike from the Fed in 2019, compared with expectations for possibly two rate hikes a month earlier, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
The U.S. central bank is expected to increase borrowing costs on Dec. 18-19 for the fourth time this year.
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. U.S. stocks fell amid uncertainty whether a 90-day truce agreed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping over the weekend would hold and lead to a lasting easing of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
RATE HIKE PAUSE? 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last month appeared to signal the central bank's three-year tightening cycle was drawing to a close, saying its policy rate was now ""just below"" the range of policymakers' estimates of a level that neither cools nor boosts a healthy economy.
Minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting published last week showed nearly all officials agreed another rate increase was ""likely to be warranted fairly soon,"" but also opened debate on when to pause further hikes.
""The outlook for 2019 is uncertain in the face of the volatility in the financial markets and the weak inflation,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics in Los Angeles. ""If the slowdown in employment gains continues, the Fed will pause for a while to get a better fix on the economy.""
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to a five-month high of 7.6 percent.
Wage gains were moderate despite online retail giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) raising its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees last month.
Job gains averaged 170,000 per month over the past three months. The economy needs to create roughly 100,000 per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
A further slowdown in employment growth is likely. The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits is near eight-month highs. General Motors (N:GM) has announced plans to cut up to 15,000 jobs in North America next year, which will affect some assembly plants in the United States.
Retail employment rose by 18,200 jobs in November, likely boosted by an early Thanksgiving. Transportation and warehousing payrolls rose by 25,400 jobs, driven by seasonal hiring.
But an unusually cold November slowed hiring at construction sites, with payrolls increasing by only 5,000 jobs after surging 24,000 in October. Manufacturing employment increased by 27,000 jobs last month after rising 26,000 in October. 

Government payrolls declined for a second straight month. State government employment fell sharply in November.

The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories rose 0.8 percent instead of gaining 0.7 percent as reported last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 0.7 percent in September.
They increased 6.9 percent year-on-year in October.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product growth gained 0.5 percent in October. Inventories rebounded in the third quarter after being depleted in the April-June period.
Inventories added 2.27 percentage points to the third quarter's 3.5 percent annualized growth rate. Given strong domestic demand, businesses are likely to continue boosting stocks of goods, which should underpin production at factories and support economic growth in the fourth quarter.
In October, wholesale auto inventories jumped 3.4 percent after advancing 2.5 percent in September. Machinery inventories increased 2.1 percent after a rising 1.4 percent in September. Stocks of farm products dropped 2.7 percent in October after decreasing 4.7 percent in the prior month.
Petroleum inventories tumbled 8.9 percent after increasing 5.7 percent in September.
Sales at wholesalers fell 0.2 in October after gaining 0.1 percent in September. There were decreases in sales of motor vehicles, furniture and hardware.

Euro zone gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.2 percent in the July-September period, Eurostat reported, confirming its earlier preliminary estimates.
This was the slowest rate of economic growth since the second quarter of 2014 and a marked slowdown from 0.4 percent growth in the second quarter.
On the year, the GDP growth rate in the 19-country currency bloc was 1.6 percent, Eurostat said, revising down its earlier estimate of a 1.7 percent expansion.
The economy of Germany, the euro zone's largest, contracted by 0.2 percent on the quarter, France's was 0.4 percent stronger, while Italy's GDP shrunk by 0.1 percent.
In a separate release on Friday, Eurostat confirmed its previous estimates on employment growth in the euro zone.

The number of people employed in the euro zone increased by 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 1.3 percent year-on-year, compared with rates of 0.4 and 1.5 percent respectively in the second quarter.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' business confidence likely worsened for a fourth straight quarter in the three months to December, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, hit by uncertainties over the global economy and the China-U.S. trade conflict. 
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is projected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence fell to plus 17 in December from plus 19 three months ago, the poll of 15 economists showed.
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers eased to plus 21 in December, slightly down from plus 22 seen three month ago, the poll found.
""Concerns over the global economic deceleration stemming from China's economic slowdown and Sino-U.S. trade friction are spreading,"" said Asuka Sakamoto, economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
Big manufacturers' business confidence is seen worsening in the coming quarter to plus 16 and non-manufacturers' sentiment is likely to deteriorate to plus 20, the Reuters poll found.
Japanese firms are becoming more pessimistic about the country's economic prospects amid a fall in household spending and a drop in real wages, another Reuters poll and data on Friday showed, adding to concerns about the strength of the economy. 
Big companies are expected to raise their capital spending plans for this fiscal year by 12.7 percent, down from 13.4 percent in the previous tankan survey.
Uncertainty over the economy likely prompted companies to revise down their plans for capital spending, Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said. 
""But labor shortage remains the driver for non-manufacturers' increasing capital spending,"" he said. 
The Bank of Japan will issue its tankan survey at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Friday Dec. 14. (2350 GMT on Dec. 13).
Separately, Reuters' monthly Tankan, which tracks the BOJ's quarterly survey, showed confidence among Japanese manufacturers worsened for a second straight month in December and is seen slipping further.
CORE MACHINERY ORDERS
Japan's core machinery orders are expected to show 10.5 percent growth in October from the previous month, the poll showed, rebounding from an 18.3 percent drop in September.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital expenditure, likely rose 5.9 percent in October following a 7.0 percent fall the previous month.
""External demand is weak but we expect domestic demand for streamlining and labor-saving, as well as upgrading aging equipment, will support machinery orders,"" said Yosuke Yasui, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.

Data from the Statistics Office showed industrial output fell by 0.5 percent, confounding a Reuters forecast for an increase of 0.3 percent.
The figure for September was revised down to a rise of 0.1 percent from a previously reported increase of 0.2 percent.
A breakdown of the data showed that activity in the manufacturing, energy and construction sectors had contracted.
The Economy Ministry put the contraction down to continued bottlenecks in new car registrations due to the introduction of stricter pollution standards, known as WLTP.
But export-dependent manufacturers in Europe's economic powerhouse are also feeling the brunt of disputes over tariffs on goods between the United States and two of its most important trading partners: China and the European Union.
The ministry said it expected the industrial sector to recover in the last two month of the year as car registration bottlenecks clear up.
Data published on Thursday showed that strong demand from abroad was behind an unexpected rise in German industrial orders in October. The figures suggested that exports may still support the economy despite broader global trade friction.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending unexpectedly fell in October and real wages slipped for a third straight month, adding to concerns about the strength of the economy as global trade frictions cloud export prospects.
The data follow a Reuters survey that showed Japanese firms are becoming more pessimistic about the country's economic prospects due to the Sino-U.S. trade war and next year's scheduled sales tax hike at home.
Household spending decreased 0.3 percent in October from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, confounding a median market forecast of a 1.4 percent rise and marking the second straight month of falls.
Separate data showed real wages slipped for a third straight month in October, adding to concerns a full-fledged recovery in consumer spending is still some way off.
""Conditions aren't falling in place for consumption to strengthen. Recent rises in fuel and food prices may have hurt non-essential spending,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Wages are gradually increasing but not enough to make up for the higher cost of living, so spending isn't rising much.""
A pickup in consumption is crucial for the Bank of Japan to achieve its elusive 2 percent inflation target, as weak spending has so far discouraged firms from raising prices for fear of turning away cost-sensitive households.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda repeated his resolve to maintain the central bank's massive stimulus program, warning of heightened global economic risks.
""The economy is sustaining its momentum for achieving our 2 percent target. But that momentum lacks strength, so we will carefully watch developments,"" he told parliament on Friday.
Japan's economy shrank in the third quarter and some analysts warn any rebound in the current quarter could miss consensus expectations as trade protectionism and slowing global demand hurt business sentiment.
""Looking at October's household spending data, we're not seeing a strong rebound in services prices,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.

""Consumption in October-December will probably rise more than the previous quarter. But the gain will be fairly small.""

National health spending grew at a rate of 3.9 percent to $3.5 trillion, the health agency reported on Thursday. In 2016, it grew at 4.8 percent. The low rate of spending growth in 2017 was similar to the average annual growth rate of 3.9 percent seen between 2008 and 2013. 
Last year, a decline in growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed, a shift to lower-cost generics, and slower uptake of high-cost treatments - notably those that treat hepatitis C, contributed to slower growth in prescription drug spending. 
The CMS had earlier this year projected spending to rise 5.3 percent in 2018, reflecting rising prices of medical goods and services and higher Medicaid costs, expecting the upward trend to continue for the next decade.

Growth in spending for private health insurance and the government's program for the poor, Medicaid, also slowed, while spending on the Medicare program remained relatively flat.

Factory goods orders fell 2.1 percent amid a decline in demand for a range of goods, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was the largest decrease in orders since July 2017. Data for September was revised lower to show factory orders rising only 0.2 percent instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders declining 2.0 percent in October. Orders increased 8.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in October.
An Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturers published on Monday showed an improvement in business conditions in November. Manufacturers across nearly all industries, however, complained that worker shortages and the Trump administration's import tariffs were disrupting operations. 
In October, orders for transportation equipment tumbled 12 percent, the biggest drop since October 2017, reflecting a 59.3 percent plunge in orders for defense aircraft and parts. Transportation equipment orders rose 0.9 percent in September.
Orders for civilian aircraft and parts dropped 22.2 percent in October. Orders for motor vehicles slipped 0.1 percent.
There were also declines in orders for primary metals and machinery. But orders for computers and electronic products rose, as did those for fabricated metal products and electronic equipment, appliances and components.
The Commerce Department also said October orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, were unchanged, as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods dropped 0.6 percent in September.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3 percent in October, as reported last month. 
Core capital goods shipments fell 0.3 percent in September. Business spending on equipment has slowed since the second quarter after strong growth in 2017 and early 2018. This is despite the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut. 

Some companies including Apple (O:AAPL) used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale. Spending on equipment could also be undercut by declining oil prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit jumped to a 10-year high in October as soybean exports dropped further and imports of consumer goods rose to a record high, suggesting the Trump administration's tariff-related measures to shrink the trade gap likely have been ineffective.
Other data on Thursday showed private employers hired fewer workers than expected in November, pointing to a moderation in the pace of job growth. That was reinforced by another report showing a small decline in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. 
The reports added to weak housing and business spending on equipment data in signaling a slowdown in economic growth. Concerns over the health of the economy have roiled financial markets in recent days. 
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $55.5 billion, the highest level since October 2008. The trade gap has now widened for five straight months. Data for September was revised to show the deficit rising to $54.6 billion instead of the previously reported $54.0 billion.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China surged 7.1 percent to a record $43.1 billion in October.
The United States is locked in a bitter trade war with China. Washington has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to force concessions on a list of demands that would change the terms of trade between the two countries. 
China has responded with import tariffs on U.S. goods, including soybeans. President Donald Trump has long railed against China's trade surplus with the United States, and accuses Beijing of not playing fairly on trade. 
In addition to the duties on Chinese goods, Washington has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the United States this year. On Saturday, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days while they negotiate a deal to end the trade dispute.
The truce appeared to be in doubt on Thursday following the arrest in Canada for extradition to the United States of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and the daughter of its founder.
""We remain skeptical of a substantial trade deal,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall trade deficit rising to $55.0 billion in October. When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit increased to $87.9 billion in October from $87.2 billion in September. The so-called real trade deficit is above the average for the third quarter. 
Trade subtracted 1.91 percentage points from GDP growth in the July-September quarter. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 2.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter.
U.S. stocks were trading sharply lower as Wanzhou's arrest sparked fears of a flare-up in Sino-U.S. tensions. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher while the dollar (DXY) was weaker against a basket of currencies. In October, exports of goods and services slipped 0.1 percent to $211.0 billion. Soybean exports, which have been targeted by China in the trade dispute and have been dropping for the last several months, fell $0.8 billion. Exports of civilian aircraft and engines also fell. 
But exports of petroleum and consumer goods were the highest on record. A strong dollar is probably restraining overall export growth.
IMPORTS HIT RECORD HIGH
Imports of goods and services rose 0.2 percent to $266.5 billion, an all-time high. Consumer goods imports increased by $2.0 billion to a record high of $57.4 billion, boosted by a $1.5 billion jump in imports of pharmaceutical preparations.
Motor vehicle imports were the highest on record in October, as were imports of other goods.
Imports are being driven by strong domestic demand as well as the strong dollar, which is making the prices of imported goods cheaper, likely offsetting the impact of tariffs.
Separately on Thursday, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls rose by 179,000 jobs in November after a downwardly revised increase of 225,000 in October. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 195,000 last month following a previously reported 227,000 increase in October.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for November, which is scheduled for release on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 200,000 in November after surging by 250,000 in October. The unemployment rate is forecast holding steady at near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent.
Though the ADP report has a spotty record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report, job growth could be slowing. Part of the cooling is likely because of a shortage of qualified workers.
In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ended Dec. 1.
Economists had forecast claims falling to 225,000 in the latest week. Claims had risen for three straight weeks, touching an eight-month high of 235,000 during the week ended Nov. 24. 
""There are distinct signs that the labor market has reached its peak,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Job layoffs are increasing, which fits hand and glove with the uncertainty businesses are facing over tariffs, and the stock market turbulence may have also dented confidence as well for companies who may be trimming their staff just a little just in case.""
A fourth report showed the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index rose 0.4 point to a reading of 60.7 last month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 

But the ISM's employment measure fell 1.3 points last month, with employers in the construction industry reporting difficulties finding workers ""due to lack of qualified talent.""

""The recovery in new orders thus likely reflects stronger domestic demand. However, some of the rebound in new order growth appears to be on the back of price discounting as well as increased marketing.""

The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD UAE Purchasing Managers' Index, which covers manufacturing and services, rose to 55.8 last month from 55.0 in October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion and below that, contraction.
Output growth accelerated to 60.1 from 58.6 and growth in new orders was 61.0 against 60.2. Employment, which had dropped outright in August and September, continued to rebound with its reading climbing to 50.6.
Khatija Haque, regional economist at Emirates NBD, said firmer export demand contributed to new order growth in November, with new export orders rising at their fastest pace in four months. Some businesses reported increased orders from other Gulf Arab countries.
But she noted that selling prices in the UAE fell at their fastest rate since the 2009 recession in November, while input price inflation accelerated.
""That input costs rose at the fastest rate since January even as firms were cutting output prices speaks to the challenging business environment and the pressure this is putting on firms to compete on price,"" she said.

Although the reading for employment rose in November, 94.2 percent of firms reported unchanged headcount last month.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 10:25PM ET</span>",China November export growth seen slowing as global demand cools,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's export growth is expected to have cooled in November, although still in the double digits, as a slowing in global demand offset a months-long rush to ship goods to the United States ahead of a then-expected increase in tariffs. 
China's import growth likely moderated but remained in recent ranges, offering some relief to Chinese policymakers concerned about slackening domestic demand and economic disruptions from the trade row with the United States. 
A truce in the trade war might steady the near-term outlook for Asia's biggest economy, which has been slowing due to a mix of domestic factors including a multi-year campaign to curb corporate debt and risky borrowing practices. 
In Argentina last weekend, Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. hike of tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal.
Shipments of Chinese goods on an earlier U.S. tariff list targeting $50 billion of products have already weakened sharply, but that has been offset by a rush of shipments on a later list affecting the $200 billion, according to analysts from Capital Economics.
The prospect of higher U.S. tariff rates from January on Chinese products on the second list has hung over the heads of Chinese exporters for months. 
Chinese exports in November likely grew 10 percent from a year earlier, slower than the previous month's 15.6 percent gain, according to the median estimate of 26 economists in a Reuters poll.
China's import growth is expected to have eased to 14.5 percent in November from a surprise 21.4 percent jump in October.
STEADY SURPLUS? 
According to the poll, China's overall trade surplus is expected to have held largely steady in November at $34 billion from $34.02 billion the previous month. 
The drop in exports and imports growth is ""still mild"", and not too much should be read into it, given the volatility, said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, adding that Chinese shippers were still front-loading goods to U.S. clients. 
""But one thing worth noting is that many factories in Guangdong province had suspended operations and put workers on holiday at end-November due to fears of a failure in the Trump-Xi meeting,"" Lu said.
The economist also said he expects weakening demand from Japan and Europe contributed to a drop in export growth in November. 
With the 90-day truce, a sharp drop-off in outbound shipments in January warned of by most analysts may not materialize, as some of the shipments to the United States may now extend into next year.
In a sign that corporate sentiment is taking a hit from worries over protectionism, manufacturing activity slipped in November in countries as varied as France, Germany, Indonesia and South Korea, private surveys showed this week.
MORE HEADWINDS
Chinese policymakers are expected to offer more policy support and deliver more stimulus measures in coming months if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate.
Cooling global demand and domestic headwinds from reduced credit growth and a slower property market look set to cast a bigger shadow on China's economy in the coming months, even without the drag of additional tariffs, some analysts warn.
Furthering dimming the outlook, scepticism is rising that the 90-day ceasefire is too short for China and the United States to work out a broad agreement over deeply divisive trade and policy issues. 

China's economy will slow further before it bottoms out, even as the immediate threat of higher and broader U.S. tariffs has receded, many economists predict.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers worsened for a second straight month in December and is seen slipping further, a Reuters monthly poll showed on Thursday, pointing to declines in the central bank's upcoming tankan business survey.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) key tankan quarterly survey, found service-sector sentiment inched up in December but was expected to slip again in the coming three months - a sign business confidence is leveling off.
Confidence at both manufacturers and service businesses was lower compared with three months ago, boding ill for the BOJ tankan survey due out on Dec. 14.
In addition to facing the external threat from a U.S.-China trade war, companies were struggling with labor shortages in an aging population and the difficulty of passing on rising raw materials costs to frugal customers. 
""Our clients are turning cautious about capex due to uncertainty over the global economic outlook with the spread of protectionism and U.S.-China trade friction,"" a manager at a machinery firm wrote in the Reuters survey.
Some 246 firms responded on condition of anonymity in the Reuters poll of 480 large- and mid-sized companies conducted Nov. 20 to Dec. 3. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers was at 23, down three points from the previous month, weighed by exporters of cars and precision machinery. The index was also down three points from three months ago, and was expected to fall to 22 in March.
The service-sector index edged up to 31 from 30 in November, led by the information and communications industry. But a big drop among retailers raised worries over private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the economy.
Compared with three months ago, the service-sector index was two points lower in December. The index is expected to slip to 30 in March.
The BOJ's last tankan on Oct. 1 showed big manufacturers' sentiment soured in the September quarter to hit its lowest in more than a year as companies struggled with natural disasters that crimped output and physical distribution.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, is expected to rebound from the third-quarter contraction, but a recent mixed batch of indicators raised doubts about the strength of recovery.
Optimism that Washington and Beijing would quickly resolve their trade dispute sharply waned this week, days after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on Saturday to shelve any new tariffs. [nL1N1Y823J]

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted measures on consumer requests for a loan to buy a home and to refinance an existing one rose 2.0 percent to 340.5 in the week ended Nov. 30. This was the strongest reading since 346.7 in the week of Oct. 5. 
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate ""conforming"" mortgages with balances of $453,100 or less, averaged 5.08 percent last week, which the lowest since the week of Oct. 5. They averaged 5.12 percent the prior week.
Interest rates on other types of home loans MBA tracks were mixed from the previous week.
Mortgage rates have fallen in step with lower U.S. Treasury yields on worries about slowing economic growth and trade tension between China and the United States, the world's two biggest economies. 
“Treasury rates continued to slide last week, driven mainly by concerns over slowing global economic growth and U.S. and China trade uncertainty,"" Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
On Tuesday, benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) fell to 2.885 percent, its lowest level since Sept. 7. 
U.S. financial markets are closed on Wednesday for a national day of mourning for former U.S. President George W.H. Bush who died last Friday.
MBA's seasonally adjusted measure on mortgage refinancing rose 6.2 percent to 836.4 last week, rising further above a near 18-year trough reached in the week of Nov. 16.
The group's seasonally adjusted index on loan applications to buy a home, which is seen as a proxy on future housing activity, edged up 0.8 percent to 249.9. 
Separately, the average loan size for purchase applications fell to $298,000, the lowest amount since December 2017 last week from $313,000. 
""This is perhaps an indication that there are fewer jumbo borrowers, or maybe first-time buyers are having better success reaching the market as we close out the year,” Kan said.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 10:45AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada more cautious on pace of rate hikes, Canadian dollar plunges","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada kept interest rates on hold on Wednesday as expected and suggested the pace of future hikes could be more gradual, knocking a cent off the Canadian dollar and slashing market expectations of another increase next month.
The central bank, which has lifted rates fives times since July 2017 as the economy strengthens and reaches capacity, repeated that more monetary tightening would be needed to help meet its 2.0 percent inflation target.
But it noted downward revisions by Statistics Canada to growth figures, together with recent macroeconomic developments, ""indicate there may be additional room for non-inflationary growth."" This is a sign the economy might not be as close to capacity as previously thought.
The Canadian dollar fell sharply and by 10:30 a.m. ET (1530 GMT) was trading at C$1.3393, or 74.67 U.S. cents, down from C$1.3275 to the greenback, or 75.33 U.S. cents.
As recently as last month markets had fully priced in another rate increase on Jan. 9. Since then, prices for oil - one of Canada's biggest exports - have fallen, and recent data showed the economy shrank in September.
""The next move should be higher. But I think this clearly lengthens the time frame that should reduce the odds of a January hike substantially,"" said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.
Market expectations of an interest rate hike next month, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, were around 35.5 percent shortly after the announcement. 
The bank's overnight interest rate stays at 1.75 percent, still well below the ""neutral"" rate of 2.5-3.5 percent where monetary policy is neither stimulative or accommodative.
""Governing Council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target,"" said the bank, predicting inflation in coming months will ease more than previously forecast as gasoline prices fall.
The appropriate pace of future hikes would depend on the effect of higher rates on consumption and housing, global trade developments, the oil price shock, the evolution of business investment ""and the Bank's assessment of the economy's capacity"", it added.
The bank ""will reassess all of these factors"" in projections for the economy that it is due to release on Jan. 9, it added.
""I think longer run, they're still committed to getting back toward a neutral policy rate, but they're inserting some pause language along that path, that tamps down the expectations for a January hike,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital market economics at Scotiabank.
The central bank said the Canadian economy had grown in line with expectations in the third quarter but data suggested less momentum going into the fourth quarter. 

Weaker oil prices and associated production cutbacks mean activity in the energy sector is set to be materially weaker than expected.

592,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>",Bank of Canada Holds Rates Steady as Trade Conflicts Weigh on Global Demand,"Investing.com - The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady as expected on Wednesday over concerns that trade disputes may be dampening the global economy.
After a quarter-point hike back in October, the BoC left rates unchanged at 1.75%, in line with economic forecasts.
Although BoC considered the current moderation in the global economic expansion to be in line with its expectations, it warned that “signs are emerging that trade conflicts are weighing more heavily on global demand.”
BoC policymakers indicated that the interest rate must rise into a neutral range to achieve its inflation target, but noted that the appropriate pace of rate increases would depend on a number of factors.
“These include the effect of higher interest rates on consumption and housing, and global trade policy developments. The persistence of the oil price shock, the evolution of business investment, and the Bank’s assessment of the economy’s capacity will also factor importantly into our decisions about the future stance of monetary policy,” the BoC said in its rate statement.
A recent Reuters’ survey showed that a majority of economists expect the BoC to increase rates three times during 2019, although conviction has dropped slightly to 56% from the 60% seen in the October survey.
“In any event, the Bank's next forecast is due in January, when our projection has them returning with a quarter-point hike. We'll need to see both firmer GDP results for October and at least some signs of a turn in crude oil for that call to play out,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC, said.
James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, noted that trade tensions remain a clear growth risk in 2019, although he expects the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement to remove grey clouds from the investment outlook.
“We expect two rate hikes in 1Q19 and 3Q19, taking the policy rate towards the lower end of the BoC's estimate of the nominal neutral rate (2.5%-3.5%, based on at-target inflation). We're not ruling out a third hike next year either, depending on the strength of wage growth and if trade tensions remain in check,” Smith commented.

593,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 10:06AM ET</span>","India central bank keeps rates on hold, moves to spur lending","By Swati Bhat and Suvashree Choudhury
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, in a decision that was widely expected as inflation has eased significantly, while it took steps to persuade banks to lend more in order to support an economy that has lost some momentum.
""The time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macro-economic fundamentals,"" the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in a statement following a monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting.
The decision to keep the repo rate  unchanged at 6.50 percent was as predicted by 64 of 70 analysts in a Reuters poll. The central bank also retained its 'calibrated tightening' stance as expected.
All six members of the MPC voted to keep the rates on hold.
""Even as inflation projections have been revised downwards significantly and some of the risks pointed out in the last resolution have been mitigated, especially of crude oil prices, several uncertainties still cloud the inflation outlook,"" the bank said in its statement. 
The central bank said starting in the January-March quarter of 2019 it would begin to lower banks' mandatory bond holding ratios, by 25 basis points each quarter until it reaches 18 percent of deposits. 
The so-called statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) currently stands at 19.50 percent and the move to lower the SLR should prod banks to lend more rather than park their cash in safe-haven government securities. 
While this will have some implication for government securities, ""the reduction in oil prices and reversal of foreign flows has resulted in further moderation of yields,"" India's economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said in statement late on Wednesday.
India's 10-year benchmark bond yield  was trading at 7.46 percent from 7.54 percent before the policy statement.
The Indian rupee  eased to 70.60 to the dollar from 70.50 before the policy statement, while the broader NSE stock index (NSEI) was down 0.8 percent at 1009 GMT.
A pause in rate hikes is a welcome relief for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party as it prepares for an election that must be called by May. Modi's government has faced criticism over the distress among farmers and small businesses. 
The government in turn has been putting pressure on the RBI to ease lending rules and nurse a weakened shadow banking sector at a time when banks laden with bad loans have become hesitant to lend. Also, the government has been asking the RBI to pay a higher dividend from its reserves to help fund the fiscal deficit.
The discord between government and RBI officials became public in October, and as a war of words ensued there was speculation that Governor Urjit Patel might resign.
Making his first media appearance since the controversy erupted, Patel refused to drawn over a matter that had raised concerns over whether the central bank's autonomy was under threat.
""Is this related to the monetary policy committee resolution? I don't think so. We're here to discuss the monetary policy committee resolution and the macro economy,"" Patel said, rebuffing questions from reporters on the issue.
INFLATION VS GROWTH 
Regarding the economy, the RBI was more a positive, but cautious.
The central bank slashed its inflation projection to 2.7-3.2 percent by March-end from its prior view of 3.9-4.5 percent. But, it also foresaw inflation picking up again, projecting a rate of between 3.8-4.2 percent in the first half of fiscal 2019/20, with risks tilted to the upside.
""The RBI will definitely keep rates on hold for another two to three quarters, with the expectation that inflation will remain below 4 percent over the next three to four quarters,"" said Shashank Mendiratta, India economist with ANZ Bank. 
The RBI also held its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year 2018/19 ending in March at 7.4 percent in contrast to expectations of a downward revision following an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in the July-September quarter, when annual growth  slid to 7.1 percent from the two-year high of 8.2 percent posted in the previous quarter.
Since embarking on a tightening cycle in June, the RBI has raised its policy repo rate by 50 basis points, with the last increase to 6.50 percent made in August. 
Since then the RBI's pause on rates has been in contrast to other Asian central banks, including South Korea, Philippines and Indonesia, that have raised rates.
But, there are now clearer economic reasons for India to avoid going higher, analysts say. 

""We believe that the RBI is likely to change stance to 'neutral' in early 2019,"" said Aurodeep Nandi, India economist with Nomura. ""We perceive that India is slowly entering into a low inflation, slowing growth quadrant.""

595,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Shock slide in UK services PMI points to stalling economy,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the terms of Brexit next March clobbered British services firms last month, leaving the economy at risk of contracting, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.4 from 52.2 in October, the weakest reading since just after the 2016 Brexit vote and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Watched closely by the Bank of England, the PMI suggested Britain's economy is on track for quarterly growth of just 0.1 percent in the final three months of 2018, IHS Markit said, a sharp slowdown from 0.6 percent in the third quarter.
Slowing consumer spending and Brexit uncertainty hobbled services firms in November.
Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan has been agreed with the EU but faces deep opposition in parliament ahead of a Dec. 11 vote, raising the risk of a no deal Brexit shock to the economy in less than four months' time.
Optimism among services companies, which account for the bulk of Britain's economic output, fell to its second-lowest level since the depths of the financial crisis, the PMI showed.
Overall the figures chimed with other surveys showing sliding confidence among both consumers and businesses. New car sales fell 6.9 percent in the first 11 months of the year due to stalling consumer confidence, industry data showed on Wednesday.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the PMI provided ""the clearest indication yet that Brexit uncertainty is draining momentum from the economy"".
The pound fell only modestly on release of the PMI, with traders mostly focused on the progress of Brexit.
Still, BoE officials will note a recent deterioration in business and consumer confidence that suggests uncertainty over Brexit is aggravating the slowdown in the economy since the 2016 referendum.
Due to a slowdown in new business - which grew at one of the weakest rates since the financial crisis - companies relied on working through backlogs of work at the fastest pace since 2009 in order to eke out growth. 
""As such, unless demand revives, a slide into economic decline at the turn of the year is a distinct possibility,"" Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said.
The services PMI fell below the 50 mark in July 2016, just after the Brexit vote, spurring the BoE to cut interest rates to a new record low.
However, BoE Governor Mark Carney and other officials at the central bank have warned investors not to count on a cut to borrowing costs if Britain's economy suffers the potentially inflationary shock of leaving the EU without a transition deal.
Slightly faster growth in employment an easing of cost pressures represented the only plus points.
Businesses will be watching a series of votes in parliament next Tuesday which, if lost by Prime Minister May, could cast her Brexit plans into further disarray.

""Clarity in relation to Brexit arrangements is ... urgently needed to help ensure the current stalling of growth does not translate into a downturn,"" Williamson said.

The UK services purchasing managers’ index fell to 50.4 in November from 52.2 the previous month. It was the weakest reading since July 2016, just after the Brexit vote and was well short of forecasts of 52.2.
Business activity and incoming new work both expanded at the weakest rates for almost two-and-a-half years, the report said.
“A sharp deterioration in service sector growth leaves the economy flatlining in November as Brexit concerns intensified. Measured across services, manufacturing and construction, the survey results suggest that the pace of economic growth has stalled,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson warned.
“Both the slowdown in current business activity and the deterioration in business optimism were primarily caused by an intensification of anxieties over Brexit. Uncertainty in relation to the withdrawal agreement and the possibility of no deal was often reported to have caused companies and customers to cancel or postpone spending and investment decisions,” he said.
Williamson further noted that overall UK economic growth was currently slated to be just 0.1% in the fourth quarter and suggested that clarity over Brexit arrangements was “urgently needed” to avoid a downturn."

IHS Markit’s Purchasing Manager’s Index for manufacturing and services in the 19-nation bloc fell to 52.7 in November from 53.1 in October. While the reading exceeded an earlier estimate, it was the worst since September 2016 and suggests only a marginal pickup in the pace of growth to 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the report.
“The region remains stuck in a soft-patch,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at IHS Markit. “The survey responses highlighted intensifying headwinds of Brexit and trade-war worries, a struggling autos sector and rising uncertainty regarding the economic and political outlook.”
The slowdown is starting to affect the labor market. Employment expanded at its weakest pace in almost two years in November, with Germany, France and Ireland faring particularly poorly.
The European Central Bank will need to confront signs of falling growth momentum and the threat of a triple-dip recession in Italy, the region’s third-largest economy, when policy makers meet on Dec. 13.
They are expected to cap their 2.6 trillion-euro ($3 trillion) asset-buying program with a pledge to maintain a significant degree of stimulus through reinvestments of maturing bonds.
Policy makers have argued the euro-area economy is returning to its normal pace of expansion, with inflation pressures starting to build. IHS Markit said companies reported elevated cost pressures on the back of higher wage payments and more expensive fuel.
Still, the slowdown that started in manufacturing is now spreading into services. Business optimism is at its lowest level since late 2014, said Williamson, adding to “downside risks for growth as we move into 2019.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was at its weakest pace in over two years last month as a manufacturing-led slowdown showed further signs of spreading to the service industry, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The downbeat survey results will likely make disappointing reading for policymakers at the European Central Bank who intend to bring an end to their 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program in less than a month.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, fell to 52.7 in November from October's 53.1, its lowest since September 2016.
That was however above a 52.4 preliminary estimate and comfortably exceeded the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The final euro zone PMI for November came in higher than the flash reading but still only points to modest GDP growth of approximately 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, suggesting the region remains stuck in a soft-patch,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
A Reuters poll last month had predicted the bloc's economic growth would bounce back somewhat and expand 0.4 percent this quarter. [ECILT/EU]
But purchasing managers were at their least optimistic for almost four years, suggesting little chance of improvement as 2018 draws to a close. The future output index fell in November to 59.5 from 60.5.
""Business optimism is running at its lowest since late 2014, adding to downside risks for growth as we move into 2019,"" Williamson said.
Manufacturing activity also expanded at its weakest rate in over two years in November, a sister survey showed on Monday, and that softness is affecting the bloc's dominant service industry. [EUR/PMIM]

The services PMI fell to a 25-month low of 53.4 from 53.7, knocked by slower growth of new business.
An index measuring overall new work for services firms fell to 53.4 from 53.9, its lowest in over two years. That was hurt by new export orders - which includes trade between member countries - contracting for a third straight month.
Adding to the gloomier outlook and concerns economic growth in the bloc is past its peak, other forward-looking indicators were also more downbeat.

IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 52.3 from 53.4 the previous month.
The reading was still above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction, however, and came in slightly better than a preliminary estimate published last month.
The economy is expected to post moderate growth in the fourth quarter after a contraction in the third, but the drop in the PMI figures in November casts doubt over the strength of any rebound, IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
In the services sector, business activity growth slowed to 53.3 in November from 54.7 the previous month, with new business from abroad falling for the fifth month in a row and business optimism slipping to the lowest level in two years.
Services firms reported the steepest rise in input prices for over seven-and-a-half years in November, reflecting higher costs for transport, labor and energy, Markit said.

The government predicts gross domestic product growth of 1.8 percent this year and next. This would be below the calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent reached last year, which was the strongest growth rate since 2011.

IHS Markit's purchasing managers index (PMI) for the French service sector inched down to 55.1 points in November from 55.3 points in October, albeit up slightly from the initial estimate for the November reading.
The composite PMI for November, factoring in both the services and manufacturing industries, edged up to 54.2 points from 54.1 in October.
Nevertheless, IHS Markit said there was cause for concern about a slowdown in hiring. 
Official data in November showed France's jobless rate had not changed much in the third quarter to stand at 9.1 percent, despite recent evidence of new jobs being created.
""The French service sector saw a broad-based softening of growth across all key indicators during November,"" said IHS Markit's economist Eliot Kerr.

""Other than the two-year low for business sentiment, perhaps the most worrying reading was the slowdown in hiring. The 15-month low for the employment index could be a sign that labor market issues are beginning to take hold,"" added Kerr.

The IHS Markit Business Activity Index for services rose to 50.3 in November from 49.2 in October, barely above the 50 line which separates growth from contraction.
In October, the services sector had contracted for the first time since May 2016. Italy's economy shrank in the third quarter for the first time in four years.
November's PMI exceeded the consensus view in a Reuters poll of nine analysts which matched last month's figure.
The sub-index for new business in the service sector edged down to 50.4 from 50.5 in October.
IHS Markit's sister survey for November manufacturing, published on Monday, showed the sector had contracted for a second consecutive month.

The composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services and manufacturing was stable at 49.3, IHS Markit said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy is expected to have contracted more sharply initially estimated in the third quarter, with analysts in a Reuters poll forecasting a steep drop in capital spending in a sign of rising headwinds in 2019 as global demand ebbs.
The poll of 16 economists predicted the world's third-biggest economy to have shrunk an annualized 1.9 percent in July-September, worse than the preliminary reading of a 1.2 percent contraction.
That would translate into 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter fall in gross domestic product, compared with the initial estimate of a 0.3 percent decline, the poll showed.
The finalised data is set to confirm that the economy was hobbled by a series typhoons, a huge earthquake and slow external demand. 
And while analysts expect a rebound in the current quarter, a weakening external environment points to a challenging 2019, as export-reliant Japan struggles to build momentum in the face of cooling global growth, trade frictions and a slowdown in corporate profits. 
""There is a high possibility that the economy will grow at relatively high pace in October-December led by production recovery,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in his report.
""But there is no doubt that the economy is loosing momentum compared with last year because of weak exports.""
Worryingly, the poll predicted capital expenditure to have slumped 1.6 percent for the quarter, the fastest fall since 2014 and significantly down from the 0.2 percent decline in the preliminary data.
Analysts say companies are expected to invest in replacing ageing equipments and boost spending to cope with labor shortages but the pace of growth in capital spending will likely be modest. 
There are already signs the China-U.S. trade row is shaking up global supply chains, and the worry is that Japan's exporters will be caught in the cross fire in a blow to its economy. 
While China expressed confidence on Wednesday that it can reach a trade deal with the United States, there is trepidation among global investors that both sides won't be able to bridge their differences to secure a durable agreement. 
President Donald Trump has already warned that he would revert to more tariffs if the two sides cannot resolve their differences.

The Cabinet Office will announce revised GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on Monday Dec. 10 Japan time (2350 GMT on Dec. 9).

The headline figure declined to 55.6 in November from 56.9 in October, remaining well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, as it has done since early 2016.
""Russian service providers showed resilience in November, registering another sharp expansion in business activity. New order growth remained steep amid stronger domestic and foreign demand,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Despite a faster decline in backlogs, services firms continued to expand workforce numbers, with the rate of job creation reaching a seven-month high,"" Jones said.
Business confidence, however, declined as companies were less optimistic about output over the next year.
Inflationary pressures in the sector remained high. Higher operating expenses were attributed to greater fuel costs and a stronger dollar, while input costs also increased.

This will offer some relief to Asia's third-largest economy, which last week reported slower economic growth in the July-September quarter.
The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index  rose to 53.7 last month from 52.2 in Oct, its highest since July and above a Reuters poll consensus of 52.5.
The index has been above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for six straight months.
Pollyanna De Lima, a principal economist at IHS Markit, said the welcome news ""complements similar upbeat results"" in the manufacturing industry, issued earlier in the week, and suggest the private sector economy ""will provide impetus"" to India's Q3 fiscal year 2018 GDP results.
The sub-index for employment showed expansion for a 15th straight month, though job-creation was at the slowest pace since September.
In the latest survey, the new business orders sub-index, a proxy for domestic demand, rose to a four-month high of 53.3 in November but foreign demand for Indian exports contracted for the first time in six months.
Stronger services activity and better-than-expected growth in manufacturing pushed a composite index from October's 53.0 to 54.5 - its highest since over 80 percent of India's currency in circulation was wiped out by the government in late 2016.
Despite input cost inflation easing to a seven-month low in November, stronger business demand let firms raise prices more steeply and improve margins, posing upside risks to inflation.

According to a separate Reuters poll, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will hike interest rates once next year, after raising them twice so far in 2018.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 11:03PM ET</span>","China November services sector expands, but demand outlook murky: Caixin PMI","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector grew at its quickest pace in five months in November thanks to an uptick in new orders, a private survey released on Wednesday showed, although the outlook for businesses over the next year worsened for the third month. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 53.8 in November from 50.8 in October, well above the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction. 
The bounce off the 13-month low in October suggests pockets of strength in domestic demand in a sector that accounts for more than half of China's gross domestic product and urban jobs. 
A sustained improvement in the vast services industry would help steady an economy that has wobbled amid trade frictions with the United States, a manufacturing slowdown at home and a cooler real estate market. 
The subindex for new business in China's services sector rose to 52.5 in November, also a five-month high, from 50.1 in October, although the rate of growth was modest and within recent ranges. 
Firms also increased their staffing in November, but at a more gradual pace than a month earlier. The subindex for employment was at 50.7 versus 51.1 in October. 
While employment in the sector has expanded for 27 months, with the exception of a slight dip in September this year, the growth has been shallower than the historical average. 
Operating expenses continued to rise in November, with a number of firms citing higher raw material prices and fuel costs, according to the Caixin survey. The subindex for input prices stood at 53.3, unchanged from October. 
Despite the upward pressure on input costs, companies raised their prices only marginally, with some firms saying they had to stay competitive.
The intense competition and uncertain outlook on client demand hit business sentiment, with the confidence gauge towards the next 12 months slipping to a four-month low of 56.1. 
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, rose to 51.9 in November from 50.5 in October, although the growth rate was relatively marginal compared with previous months. 
China's factory activity grew slightly in November, mainly propped up by manufacturers cutting prices, a separate Caixin surveyed showed on Monday. 
Beijing has vowed to step up support for private businesses as the world's second-largest economy slowed. 

China's central bank has already cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves four times so far this year, to spur lending. Taxes have also been reduced to help ease the burden of companies.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine annual inflation slowed to a four-month low in November, easing pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates further with some analysts predicting a rate cut as early as next year if the inflationary pressures continue to ease. 
The consumer price index rose 6.0 percent in November from a year earlier, the Philippine Statistics Authority said on Wednesday, coming off its highest rate in nearly a decade in the past two months of 6.7 percent amid slower price increases in food and utilities.
It was the lowest inflation rate since July and below the median estimate of 6.2 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. 
The central bank had forecast inflation within a range of 5.8-6.6 percent for the month.
Seasonally adjusted inflation dropped 0.3 percent in November from the previous month - the first such decline since February 2016.
The central bank is likely to hold off tightening further at its next policy meeting on Dec. 13, with inflationary pressures seen easing going forward, said Jiaxin Lu, economist at Continuum Economics.
""Should inflation continue to show this kind of stark deceleration over the next few months ... the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) may opt to slash borrowing costs as early as the second quarter of 2019,"" said ING Bank senior economist Nicholas Mapa.
The central bank has raised interest rates by a total 175 basis points at the last five consecutive meetings. But central bank Governor Nestor Espenilla said, ""monetary policy will need to stay vigilant to keep inflation under firm control amid expected strong economic growth.""
While the drop-off in inflation last month confirms that it is heading back to the central bank's 2-4 percent target range, Espenilla told reporters in a text message, adding that there's a need to monitor rising core inflation.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel items, quickened to 5.1 percent from the previous month's 4.9 percent.
Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno is confident there won't be any significant inflationary pressure from the government's decision to push ahead with a second round of fuel tax increases.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday approved a further hike in excise tax on fuel products from January 2019, reversing an earlier stance to postpone it following a slide in global oil prices.

""There is no reason why there will be a second round effect"" from the fuel tax increase, Diokno told reporters, adding pump prices were still lower overall.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy slowed more than expected last quarter as consumers reacted to tepid wage growth by shutting their wallets, a disappointing outcome that sent the local dollar sliding as investors pushed out the chance of any rate hike.
The news came as fears of a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy and the Sino-U.S. tariff slugged world shares and threatened future business investment.
The gloomy report provides another blow to Australia's center-right government, which is already lagging in polls ahead of a likely election in May.
Wednesday's report on gross domestic product (GDP) showed the economy expanded 0.3 percent in the third quarter, half of what economists had expected. Second-quarter growth was unrevised at 0.9 percent.
Annual GDP rose by a still-respectable 2.8 percent to A$1.8 trillion ($1.32 trillion), but confounded expectations in a Reuters poll for a 3.3 percent increase.
The figures also imply growth in the year to June was 3 percent, rather than the originally report 3.4 percent.
The data will not be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which predicts growth of around 3-1/2 percent this year and next.
""The RBA forecasts are now looking pretty optimistic,"" said Tom Kennedy, senior economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""You are seeing consumer spending pull back a little bit... There's not that much cash out there for consumers to spend to their discretion,"" he added. 
""Wage growth is low and the household savings rate is also pretty low. You overlay that with the fact that housing is slowing means the wealth effect... is no longer supporting consumption."" 
The disappointing set of numbers sent the Australian dollar  on a dive to $0.7295 from a high of $0.7355 touched earlier in the day. It was last down 0.4 percent at $0.7310.
MISERLY CONSUMERS
Australia's economy has generally outperformed its rich world peers in recent years and is in its 28th year of growth without a recession. 
The performance owed much to Australia's ability to attract a surfeit of skilled migrants, which kept population growth at a rapid 1.6 percent a year. 
Without that, GDP per capita rose a modest 1.2 percent in the third quarter.
A major drag in Wednesday's report came from private consumption, which added a mere 0.2 percent to growth after 0.7 percent in the June quarter.
An accelerating decline in Sydney and Melbourne home prices has eaten into consumer wealth at a time when they hold record levels of mortgage debt. A long stretch of unusually slow wages growth has also throttled household incomes, and shows little sign of changing anytime soon.
Indeed, the GDP report showed that while employers were taking on a lot of new workers they weren't paying them much more, so average wages rose by just 0.2 percent in the quarter.
This soft underbelly of the economy has become a concern for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and is one reason it kept interest rates at record lows of 1.5 percent this week.
Adding to the case for caution is the ongoing U.S. trade dispute with China, Australia's single most lucrative export market.
Thus while the RBA is still tipping economic growth of 3.5 percent this year and next, it shows no inclination to tighten anytime soon.
Futures markets <0#FF:> are now pricing in only a 20 percent probability of a hike by Christmas next year, down from 30 percent before the 0030 GMT GDP data release.

The data are a blow to the Reserve Bank narrative of record-low rates fueling economic growth of around 3.5 percent this year and next to drive higher wages. It’s now contending with a less robust expansion at a time when house prices just recorded the biggest drop since the global financial crisis. That could prompt consumers to further rein in spending.
“The economy lost momentum moving in to the second half of 2018 centered on housing and the consumer, against the backdrop of a further tightening of lending standards to the housing sector,” said Andrew Hanlan, a senior economist at Westpac Banking Corp. “Business investment also took a step lower, led by mining, with the completion of major gas projects.”
The Australian dollar dropped, buying 73.13 U.S. cents at 12:50 p.m. in Sydney from 73.47 cents before the release. Cash-rate futures priced out any chance of an interest-rate increase through September next year and there’s now a less than 50 percent chance of a hike in 2020.
Key Insights
The RBA has kept interest rates at 1.5 percent for almost 2-1/2 years to spur the economy and lift inflation. It maintains that the next move is likely to be up -- having not hiked since late 2010.
House prices in Sydney are down 9.5 percent since July 2017, on the cusp of overtaking the peak-to-trough decline recorded during the last recession 27 years ago.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) stood at 52.3 on a seasonally adjusted basis, slipping only marginally from October's six-month high of 52.4.
It marked the 26th straight month that the index held above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction.
The latest data underlined the resilience of Japanese business activity, which staged a solid rebound in October from the damage caused by natural disasters that disrupted factory operations and deliveries in September.
The services data builds ""a stronger case for a rebound in the Q4 GDP number,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
A preliminary estimate out last month showed Japan's economy contracted by an annualised rate of 1.2 percent in the third quarter.
Hayes said reports from panel members suggested that demand was solid enough for companies to raise prices.
If core inflationary pressures on the service-side of the economy builds, that bodes well for the Bank of Japan as it struggles to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target, despite more than five years of massive monetary stimulus.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 52.4 in November from the previous month's 52.5.

A separate survey on Japan's manufacturing PMI showed on Monday that manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year in November as growth in new orders slowed.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy expanded for a ninth straight quarter in July-to-September and at a faster pace than the previous quarter, mainly driven by stronger consumer spending, government data showed on Tuesday.
Gross domestic product grew by 1.0 percent in the third quarter compared to an upwardly revised 0.4 percent in April-to-June, according to the seasonally adjusted data from statistics agency ELSTAT. 
With Greece officially emerged from bailouts since late August, the data showed its recovery remains on track after a lengthy recession that shrank its economy by a quarter.
On an annual basis, Greece's economic expansion accelerated to 2.2 percent in the third quarter from a downwardly revised 1.7 percent in the second quarter.
""The pick up in growth year-on-year was driven by stronger private consumption and a rise in inventories, helping to offset a significant drop in gross fixed capital formation which was amplified by an adverse base effect,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas.
That GDP component was upwardly revised to 26 percent in the third quarter of 2017 from a previous 8.3 percent decline.
""Exports continued their upward course but imports rose at a faster pace reflecting the strengthening of domestic demand,"" Magginas added.
The data showed that on an annual basis, net exports made a negative contribution to overall economic growth. Exports grew 7.6 percent, trailing a 15 percent rise in imports. 
Based on next year's budget draft, Greece projects 2.1 percent growth in 2018, accelerating to 2.5 percent next year.
""The third quarter growth figure is in line with official forecasts for this year as a whole,"" Magginas said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Prices for Dubai's residential real estate sank 7.4 percent in the third quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, with the drop accelerating from a 5.8 percent fall in the second quarter, the United Arab Emirates central bank said in a report on Tuesday.
Prices have been falling quarter-on-quarter almost continually since the start of 2017 because of a worsening supply/demand balance. The central bank quoted the REIDIN residential sales price index, which showed prices fell 2.5 percent from the previous quarter in July-September.
Residential real estate prices in neighboring Abu Dhabi, the other big emirate in the UAE, dropped 6.1 percent year-on-year in the third quarter after a 6.9 percent slide in the second quarter.
One factor weakening demand for real estate is subdued employment growth in the UAE, particularly among white-collar workers who might buy homes. Most jobs in the wealthy oil-exporting country are held by foreigners.
Total employment grew just 0.6 percent from a year ago in the third quarter -- the slowest rate in over four years -- after 1.2 percent growth in the second quarter, the central bank said. 
In the first nine months of 2018, employment grew at an average rate of 1.6 percent against a 2.6 percent increase in the same period of 2017.
The central bank figures showed employment in sectors including construction and real estate continuing to expand, partly because of Dubai's preparations to host the Expo 2020 world's fair.
But employment in some sectors that generate large numbers of white-collar jobs, such as services, fell in the third quarter, in some cases at their fastest rates for several years.
In an effort to bolster white-collar numbers, the UAE government last week announced a scheme to offer long-term visas to rich property investors, senior scientists and entrepreneurs. 

But eligibility for the visas is tightly restricted and they do not offer a path to UAE citizenship, so analysts said the scheme might do little by itself to change employment or real estate market trends.

A similar survey on manufacturers on Monday also beat expectations, despite a warning from the Bank of England last week that in a worst-case scenario, a no-deal Brexit could lead to a sharper recession than after the 2008 financial crisis. 
Construction hiring was especially robust, rising at the fastest rate since December 2015.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending grew last month at its slowest pace in more than a year, excluding Easter distortions, with online Black Friday sales failing to offset a lack of confidence about the economy ahead of Brexit, industry data showed on Tuesday. 
Total retail spending was up 0.5 percent in November compared with the same month last year, slowing sharply from a rise of 1.3 percent in October, the British Retail Consortium said. 
""Weak consumer demand and falling confidence mean that retailers are in for a nerve-wracking run up to Christmas,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
""Conditions in the industry have been particularly tough since the vote to leave the EU in 2016 and the current uncertainty has only compounded the challenges."" 
Separately, Barclaycard said its broader measure of consumer spending rose by 3.3 percent last month, the slowest growth since March.
""It seems shoppers are yet to make their main Christmas purchases for friends, family and loved ones – despite many retailers offering Black Friday discounts to try and boost sales,"" Barclaycard director Esme Harwood said.
Like Britain's overall economy, spending by consumers has slowed since the 2016 Brexit vote. The lack of clarity about how Britain will leave the European Union in less than four months' time has weighed on consumer confidence.
Cold weather last month was not enough to tempt shoppers to buy winter clothes, as clothing spending dropped by 2.9 percent, the biggest fall since October 2017, Barclaycard said. 
Consumers spent more on entertainment as ticket sales soared by 30.5 percent, the most since November 2014, boosted by the Spice Girls reunion tour and the release of the film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, the company said. 
The BRC said like-for-like retail sales, which exclude new store openings and more closely represent how retailers typically present their earnings, were down 0.5 per cent on November last year, the biggest fall since October 2017 excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter.
Barclaycard said consumers' confidence in their finances was the lowest level since 2015, influenced by ""ongoing economic and political uncertainty"". 
Prime Minister Theresa May risks seeing her Brexit transition deal rejected in a key parliamentary vote on Dec. 11. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, businesses fear disruption to supply chains and goods imports to Britain.

The BRC said Black Friday was an ""increasingly digital event"" as a record 33.8 percent of spending on non-food products was done online.

The data comes as many investors are watching for signs the Federal Reserve's three-year tightening cycle could be coming to a close after an expected hike this month, which would be the fourth by the U.S. central bank this year. 
The Commerce Department said total construction spending fell 0.1 percent to $1.31 trillion in October, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast outlays rising 0.4 percent. 
The figure rose 4.9 percent on a year-over-year basis. 
The Commerce Department also revised its September construction figure, previously reported as unchanged, to show a 0.1 percent decline. 
Private construction spending fell by 0.4 percent in October, compared to 0.4 percent growth a month earlier. Private residential outlays dipped 0.5 percent to the lowest since November 2017. 
U.S. manufacturing activity picked up in November, according to data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), though a gauge of prices paid tumbled from a month earlier. 
ISM's U.S. manufacturing index rose to 59.3 in November from 57.7 in October, topping economists' expectations for a reading of 57.6. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
A subindex of prices paid fell to 60.7 from 71.6 in October, coming in well below estimates for a reading of 70. Gauges of new orders and employment rose. 
Separate figures on Monday from financial data firm Markit showed the pace of growth in the factory sector slipped to a three-month low, though a gauge of new orders ticked higher.
Markit's U.S. manufacturing PMI fell to 55.3 from 55.7 in October, the lowest since August and down slightly from Markit's preliminary reading for November.
Financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on signs of progress in trade negotiations between the United States and China. 
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's November meeting released on Thursday showed nearly all Fed officials had agreed another rate hike was warranted soon but also opened debate on whether to pause further increases.
Policymakers flagged issues including signs of slowing in interest-rate sensitive sectors, along with global risks and other factors. 
Data on Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending had risen by the most in seven months in October, but that underlying price pressures slowed.

The employment index increased to 58.4 last month from the prior 56.8. Economists had predicted a drop to 56.5.
The prices paid index decreased to 60.7 in November, from the previous reading of 71.6. Analysts had forecast the reading to fall to 70.0.
Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM business survey committee, highlighted that demand remained strong, while customers’ inventories were declining and remained “too low”.
“The manufacturing community continues to expand, with November adding positively to the three-month rolling PMI average,” Fiore commented."

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.9 last month, its highest since August. In October, the index hit a 21-month low of 53.9.
A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
The new orders index rose to 53.7 from 52.2 in October, while the employment index climbed to 57.1, its highest since the survey began in October 2010, from 55.3.
""The latest robust increase in staffing levels was widely linked to capacity pressures and a subsequent rise in investment spending across the manufacturing sector,"" said Christian Buhagiar, president and CEO, Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA).
""Survey respondents commented on a boost to sales from improving U.S. economic conditions. However, there were also signs that worldwide trade frictions continued to hold back client demand,"" Buhagiar said.
The new export orders index has moderated from a recent peak of 55.9 in May. Still, it edged up in November to 53.2 from 52.6 in October.
Lower oil-related prices has helped offset higher costs for imported materials, particularly metals, IHS Markit said.

The input price index fell to a nine-month low of 64.9 from 66.1 October.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 06:25AM ET</span>","World outlook darkens as factory activity slips, orders fall","By Jonathan Cable and Leika Kihara
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global economic prospects appear gloomy as year-end approaches after factory activity and export orders weakened in November, prompting analysts to predict no quick rebound amid persistent global trade tensions.
In a sign that corporate sentiment is taking a hit from the worries over protectionism, manufacturing activity slipped in November in countries as varied as France, Germany, Indonesia and South Korea, IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Indexes showed on Monday.
British factories bucked the trend but the approach of Brexit was felt as companies stocked up on parts to counter any border delays, while exports suffered a rare back-to-back fall. 
U.S. data due out later on Monday are expected to show that factory growth in the world's largest economy remained robust last month but eased slightly from October.
And although factory activity rose slightly in China, new export orders extended their decline in a further blow to a sector already hurt by a U.S.-led trade war.
However, global shares rallied on Monday after U.S. and Chinese leaders meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina at the weekend agreed a truce in their trade conflict, offering some reassurance on the economic outlook. 
But analysts said the 90-day deadline the two sides agreed upon to reach a deal meant a conclusive resolution of the row remained distant.
""Other than the tariff deferral... little else of substance was agreed,"" RBC economists told clients. 
""Tellingly, no joint statement was released, with both sides instead releasing their own statements on the outcome which illustrate the gap that still exists between them.""
A darker outlook in the euro zone is linked to the trade war, which is damaging global growth and intensifying political uncertainty in the currency bloc, IHS Markit said. 
New orders fell for a second month in the euro zone and factory managers see no sign of any early pickup, meaning optimism remains low. 
Manufacturing activity in the currency bloc expanded at its weakest rate in more than two years in November as orders contracted for a second month, further evidence that euro zone economic growth is past its peak. 
Britain's PMI proved stronger than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists but was still one of the lowest since voters decided in a referendum in June 2016 to leave the European Union.
Deep uncertainty over the future pushed many British manufacturers to build up inventories of parts to protect themselves against the risk of customs delays at the border when Britain leaves the EU on March 29.
""We expect economic momentum to cool over the winter as wider investment stalls, and consumers become even more cautious,"" said James Smith at ING. 
""For manufacturing specifically, the external environment poses further challenges as euro zone momentum slows and trade tensions remain elevated.""
ASIAN WOBBLE
India's factory activity in November expanded at the fastest pace this year, buoyed by a rise in domestic and foreign demand that allowed firms to raise prices.
Yet China's manufacturing sector activity grew slightly in November as export orders shrank, reflecting weakening global demand, its PMI showed.
The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November showing growth in China's vast factory sector sliding to its lowest in more than two years.
South Korean factory activity in November contracted again after two brief months of growth as new export orders shrank by the most in over five years, a sign of increasing pressure on businesses from slowing global demand.
A revised survey showed Japan's manufacturing activity expanded in November at the slowest pace in more than a year as growth in new orders slowed, a worrying sign economic expansion may be muted in the fourth quarter.
""The underlying picture remains subdued, with momentum tilting towards a slowdown,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the Purchasing Managers' Index. 
The survey results came on the heels of data out earlier on Monday showing a sharp slowdown in Japan's capital expenditure, which had been considered a key driver of the export-reliant economy.
Japan's economy shrank an annualized 1.2 percent in July-September as natural disasters and slowing global demand hurt factory output and exports.
Monday's capital expenditure reading could mean revised gross domestic product (GDP) data due next week will show the economy shrank more than first calculated, analysts say.
""The contraction in July-September GDP could be deeper than the preliminary reading,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.

""External demand is weakening since the start of this year on slowing global growth, so it's hard to expect Japan's economy to strengthen much. The economy will likely stall for the time being,"" he said.

621,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>",UK Manufacturing PMI Rises to 53.1 in November,"Investing.com - Activity in the UK manufacturing sector accelerated slightly last month, but remained subdued as new export business dropped for a second straight month, according to a closely watched business survey released on Monday.
Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.1 in November, up from October’s 27-month low of 51.1. 
That was better than forecasts of 51.6, but was still among the weakest readings registered over the past two-and-a-half years.
The increase came as companies moved to stockpile products to guard against possible supply disruptions after Brexit.
“The November PMI provided a lackluster picture of the UK manufacturing sector, as ongoing global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty weighed on current business conditions and dampened the outlook for the year ahead,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
“Based on its relationship against official ONS data, the survey indicators suggest manufacturing output is on course to make no contribution to GDP growth in the final quarter, with a clear risk of output contracting unless December proves a stronger month.”
The level of new export business dropped for the second straight month in November, the first back-to-back contractions since early-2016, with companies citing ongoing Brexit uncertainty as the reason for the declines.
Employment in the sector picked up slightly after a weak month in October, but the overall degree of business optimism dipped to a 27-month low, as Brexit uncertainty, exchange rate concerns and a slowing economy weighed on confidence.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:25AM ET</span>","French factory activity softens in November on weak demand, protests: PMI","PARIS (Reuters) - French factory activity was its softest in over two years in November as manufacturers had to contend with a protest movement hitting supply chains on top of weak client demand, a survey showed on Monday.
Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index fell to 50.8 in November from October in 51.2, hitting the lowest level since September 2016.
The result was a tad higher than a preliminary reading of 50.7, but nonetheless brought the index closer to the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
""French manufacturers struggled across the board in November, reporting contractions in new orders and employment as well as sharp input cost inflation,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""The latest survey responses also revealed that recent 'gilets jaunes' protests adversely affected the supply side of the sector, with some panellists blaming demonstrations for lengthened delivery times,"" he added.
For more than two weeks, the ""gilets jaunes"" or ""yellow vests"" have blocked roads across France in a spontaneous, popular rebellion against diesel tax hikes and the high cost of living. 
It has grown into one of the largest and most stubborn challenges Emmanuel Macron has faced in his 18-month-old presidency.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at its weakest rate in over two years in November as new orders contracted for a second month, further evidence the bloc's economic growth is past its peak, a survey showed.
Policymakers at the European Central Bank are due to draw a line under their 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program at the end of the year and the survey will likely make disappointing reading.
IHS Markit's November final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a third month, coming in at 51.8 from October's 52.0, although above a flash reading of 51.5 and still exceeding the 50 level separating growth from contraction.
But that was its lowest level since August 2016 and an index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI that is seen as a good guide to economic health, stumbled to 50.7 from 51.3 - its lowest since mid-2013. The preliminary estimate was 50.4.
""November's PMI data underscore the extent to which manufacturing conditions have become more challenging, indicating that production could act as a drag on the euro zone economy in the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
That calls into question the findings in a Reuters poll last month which indicated euro zone growth would bounce back to a faster pace this quarter. [ECILT/EU]
""Hopes that the soft patch may prove short-lived are countered by business optimism about prospects for the year ahead remaining among the gloomiest seen since the sovereign debt crisis in 2012, suggesting companies are bracing themselves for further weak demand in the coming months,"" Williamson said.
With new orders falling for a second month, factory managers don't see any pick up soon and optimism remained low. The future output index only nudged up to 56.3 from a near six-year low of 56.1 in October.

The darker outlook is linked to a U.S.-led trade war with China, which economists say is damaging to global growth, and intensifying political uncertainty in the currency bloc, IHS Markit said. [ECILT/US]

624,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Greek manufacturing growth picks up to six-month high in November: PMI,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek factory activity continued to expand in November with momentum strengthening as production and new orders increased at a faster pace with firms adding staff, a survey showed on Monday.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing, which accounts for about 10 percent of the Greek economy, rose to 54.0 in November from 53.1 in October, indicating the biggest improvement in operating conditions since May.
Readings above the 50 mark denote expansions in activity.
""Bucking the trend seen across the euro zone as a whole, (Greek) goods producers registered a stronger rise in output and new orders,"" said Sian Jones, IHS Markit economist.
Production increased at the quickest rate in eight months as a result of robust client demand and strong new order volumes. 
Manufacturers attributed the increased order flow to stronger domestic demand, linked to increased tourism-related activity.
But new business from abroad grew at a weaker pace.
""Greece's manufacturing sector was not exempt from the global slowdown in export demand. New business from abroad expanded at the slowest pace in the current 14-month sequence of growth,"" Jones said.
Firms expanded their workforce numbers at the fastest pace in three months in November, with the pace of job creation one of the quickest since data collection began in 1999, the survey showed.
On the price front, input price inflation remained sharp with firms attributing increased cost burdens to higher raw materials and fuel prices. Still, stronger client demand allowed producers to partly pass on higher input costs to clients.

""Firms were encouraged by greater domestic demand to increase output charges during the month following a slight fall in October,"" Jones said.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 02:45AM ET</span>",Turkish annual inflation falls in November from 15-year peak,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's consumer price index fell 1.44 percent month-on-month in November, official data showed on Monday, bringing the annual rate down from a 15-year high as a stronger lira, tax cuts and discounted products helped to trim prices.
Year-on-year, consumer inflation stood at 21.62 percent in November, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute showed. A Reuters poll forecast a 0.75 percent monthly decrease in November and annual inflation of 22.6 percent. 
Transportation prices lead the fall, with prices decreasing 6.46 percent as food and non-alcoholic beverage prices fell 0.74 percent, the data showed. The producer price index fell 2.53 percent in November for an annual rise of 38.54 percent.
Inflation has been a main concern for investors, with the central bank facing pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy"" of interest rates, to lower borrowing costs.
Stoked by the weak lira , which slumped in August and at one stage was down 47 percent against the dollar since the start of the year, inflation surged to 25.24 percent in October. The lira was steady at 5.17 after Monday's data.

Analysts had said a fall in inflation was expected due to tax cuts for some consumer products including vehicles, furniture and white goods, as well as Ankara's encouragement of shops to offer at least 10 percent discounts until the end of the year on goods affecting inflation.

626,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",Strong demand pushes India November factory growth to best pace in 2018: PMI,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's factory activity in November expanded at the fastest pace this year, buoyed by a rise in domestic and foreign demand that allowed firms to raise prices, a private survey showed.
Monday's survey bolsters views that business activity in Asia's third-largest economy continues to recover from a slowdown and indicated that risks from rising inflation pressure would not dissuade the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from tightening monetary policy again.
The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index , compiled by IHS Markit, rose to 54.0 last month from October's 53.1, confounding median expectations in a Reuters poll for a fall to 52.6.
It held above the 50-point threshold mark that separates growth from contraction for the 16th straight month.
""The relatively weak demand environment seen earlier in the year showed signs of abating, with clients unfazed by another round of increases in output prices and placing more orders regardless,"" noted Pollyanna De Lima, a principal economist at IHS Markit.
Separately, data on Friday showed India's annual pace of economic growth moderated to 7.1 percent in the July-September quarter, from 8.2 percent in the previous three months.
The pace was pulled down by a slowdown in consumer spending and farm growth at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government turns its attention to an election due by May.
The latest survey showed the new orders sub-index, a proxy for domestic demand, rose to 55.9 in November - its highest since December 2017 and an encouragement to firms to increase output.
Foreign demand expanded at its quickest pace in nearly four years while optimism about future output increased from October's 20-month low.
""Signs of rising confidence in the upturn were also provided by the trend for employment, which continued to grow at one of the quickest rates seen in six-years,"" de Lima said.
""Supply-chain pressures remained weak, however, which supported a softer rise in input prices.""
Employment growth remained well-above the long-term average of 50.7 in November although firms hired at a slower pace last month than they did in October.
Despite input cost inflation easing to a seven-month low in November, stronger demand let firms raise prices at the fastest pace since February 2017, posing upside risks to inflation.

According to a Reuters poll, the RBI will raise interest rates once next year, after raising them twice this year, to try and contain inflation, which hit a 13-month low of 3.31 percent in October.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for November, released on Monday, ticked up to 50.2 from 50.1 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 50.0, the level that separates expansion from contraction. 
Domestic orders have been losing momentum in recent quarters as the world's second-largest economy slows. Overall, a sub-index measuring new orders did improve slightly to 50.9 in November from 50.4 in the previous month, after manufacturers cut prices. 
Exports have held up so far, but the lingering threat of higher U.S. tariffs next year amid a trade war with the United States, China's No.1 trade partner, remained a drag on Chinese manufacturing. 
That risk was underscored by the sub-index for new export orders shrinking to 47.7 in November from 48.8 a month earlier, amid relatively weak global demand conditions, according to the survey. 
Over the weekend, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina, China and the United States agreed to suspend additional tariffs in a deal that keeps their trade war from escalating for now. 
Trump said he would not increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Jan. 1 as previously announced, with the two sides aiming to reach an agreement within 90 days.
""Sentiment among exporters may improve during the next couple of months thanks to the tariff ceasefire agreed to by Trump and Xi over the weekend,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. 
""While this may help to buoy the PMIs temporarily, we doubt it will prevent China's economy from slowing in the coming quarters.""
A more immediate worry for Chinese manufacturers is weak domestic demand.
(GRAPHIC: China economic indicator dashboard - http://tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a) 
The Caixin survey showed ebbing client orders weighing on China's factory output, which stalled in November after months of expansion, the survey showed. 
To counter weaker domestic demand, manufacturers cut prices for the first time in more than a year and a half. But that was not enough to prevent a rise in inventories, the first increase since April. 
The output prices sub-index fell below the 50-mark to 49.8 in November, boding ill for profit margins. Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for a sixth month in October, according to the latest official data.
The gauge on overall production fell to 50.0 from 50.1 in the previous month. 
The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November showing growth in the nation's vast factory sector sliding to over a two-year low.
With client demand muted, an effort to contain operating costs led Chinese manufacturers to further reduce staff, while confidence toward the year ahead stayed subdued, according to the survey.
The employment sub-index slipped to 48.4 in November from 48.8 in October. 
One bright spot - average input costs grew at their slowest pace in seven months. 
Yet the trade frictions with the United States obscured the outlook for China's economy, which has been slowing this year and is widely expected to cool further in 2019. 
The United States and China have levied tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods this year.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",Australian firms pay record salaries but housing a drag,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians firms doled out a record amount in salaries last quarter as hiring picked up in a welcome lift for a struggling consumer sector, but steep losses in the once red-hot housing market are whipping up headwinds for the economy.
Data out on Monday showed third-quarter gross company profits surged to an all-time peak of about A$90 billion ($66.2 billion), up 1.9 percent from a year ago. The solid performance allowed firms to hire more, inflating their wage bill to A$138.3 billion.
While the overall salary bill for corporates has surged, this has not translated into stellar pay hikes with growth in the country's wage price index crawling at around 2.3 percent.
That coupled with the housing downturn poses a political challenge for the ruling center-right coalition with elections due next year. That is also a major reason the central bank is expected to keep rates at a record low 1.50 percent at its December meeting on Tuesday.
Interest rates have been on hold since August 2016, marking the longest period of unchanged policy since the cash rate was introduced in 1990. The futures market <0#YIB:> is not fully pricing in a hike until early 2020.
One blotch on Monday's data was inventories, which were unchanged compared with analyst expectations for a 0.4 percent gain, suggesting a drag to third-quarter economic growth. 
The gross domestic product (GDP) report due on Wednesday is expected to show growth of 0.6 percent in the third quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists. That would take annual growth to a brisk 3.3 percent, slightly higher than government and central bank forecasts of around 3 percent increase.
Australia's A$1.8 trillion ($1.37 trillion) economy is now in its 27th straight year of expansion but analysts expect a drag from the housing and consumer sectors.
Separate data out earlier showed home prices across Australia slipped 0.7 percent in November, clocking their worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis.
The losses were led by Sydney, the country's largest market, where prices fell 1.4 percent. Sydney's housing market has tumbled 9.5 percent since peaking last July. The last time prices fell by that much was during the 1989-1991 recession.
Many economists believe the housing downturn will hurt private consumption with the household savings ratio already in a decline. 
""House prices and consumption are clearly correlated,"" George Tharenou, Sydney-based economist at UBS, wrote in a report. 
""A 10 percent fall in home prices alone could cut 2 percent from nominal consumption in coming years,"" he added. ""We expect consumption to moderate from the strong 3 percent (annual) pace in recent quarters, to 2.3 percent in 2019."" 
Also adding to the headwinds was an index of job vacancies, which slowed in November to annual growth of 2.3 percent -- the weakest outcome since May 2015.
""ANZ Australian Job ads have effectively tracked sideways since the start of the year, with the annual growth rate losing momentum as a consequence,"" said ANZ economist David Plank. 
""We would...be concerned to see job ads sliding.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese corporate capital expenditure growth rose for an eighth consecutive quarter in July-September but the pace of gains slowed sharply, raising doubts about the strength of business activity amid global trade friction.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Monday showed capital expenditure grew 4.5 percent in July-September from the same period last year, led by chemicals, production machinery, information and communications. It slowed from a 12.8 percent gain in the previous quarter.
Excluding software, capital expenditure fell 4.0 percent in July-September from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, down for the first time in five quarters.
The data will be used to calculate revised gross domestic product figures due on Dec. 10.
Capital expenditure has been a bright spot in the world's third largest economy, as companies refurbish their old equipment and boost investment in automation and labour-saving technology to cope with labor shortages in an aging society.
A preliminary estimate out last month showed Japan's economy contracted by an annualised rate of 1.2 percent in the third quarter due to natural disasters and sluggish external demand.
But a recent run of indicators such as factory output and retail sales bolstered the view that Japan's economy is back on track for growth, climbing out of the third-quarter slump.
Monday's MOF data showed corporate recurring profits rose 2.2 percent in July-September from a year earlier, up for a ninth consecutive quarter, although they slowed sharply from the previous quarter's 17.9 percent annual gain.

Corporate sales rose 6.0 percent year-on-year in July-September, up for an eighth straight quarter.

The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 52.2 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from a flash reading of 51.8 but below October's final 52.9.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 27th consecutive month but reached the lowest level since August 2017, when it also was 52.2.
""The underlying picture remains subdued, with momentum tilting towards a slowdown,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Subdued sales performances reflected fragile conditions both domestically and abroad. According to firms, weak demand from China and parts of Europe hampered export growth.""
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, shrank more than expected in the third quarter, hit by natural disasters and sluggish exports.
While the economy is expected by many to return to growth this quarter as effects of the disasters fade, slowing global demand and the U.S.-China trade war cloud the outlook for export-reliant Japan.
For November, the PMI's final index for new orders was 50.9, compared with the preliminary reading of 49.6 and a final 52.6 in the previous month.

The index for export orders was a final 50.8 for last month, unchanged from the flash reading and below a final 51.1 in October.

SEOUL - South Korean exports sustained growth in annual terms in November but missed expectations, official data showed on Saturday, as the first drop in shipments to China in over two years underlined cooling global demand.
Exports by Asia's fourth-largest economy grew 4.5 percent last month from a year earlier, missing market expectations as sales of computer memory chips slowed while demand from neighboring China shrank, the trade ministry data showed.
Exports rose to $51.92 billion in November from $49.70 billion a year earlier while imports grew 11.4 percent to $46.78 billion, the preliminary data showed. As a result, South Korea posted a trade surplus of $5.14 billion. 
The bleak November foreign trade data, the first November data from a major exporting economy, came shortly before U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jin ping are due to hold a meeting in Buenos Aires, at which they are expected to discuss their trade dispute.
""If the two leaders reach an agreement not to slap additional tariffs, it would be great news to South Korean exports, but otherwise, exports would significantly lose momentum from early next year,"" Park Sang-hyun, an analyst at Leading Investment & Securities, said of South Korean exports.
Exports were tipped to rise 6.6 percent in annual terms and imports by 12.0 percent in a Reuters survey.
Shipments to China, South Korea's largest market, slipped 2.5 percent on-year in November in the first drop since October 2016. Overseas sales of memory chips grew 11.6 percent, the slowest since November 2016.
South Korea is home to world-wide suppliers of chips, ships, cars and petroleum products, and is the first major exporter to report its monthly trade data, providing an early scan of global economic health.
Saturday's data brought South Korea's combined exports for the first 11 months of this year at $557.19 billion, up 6.2 percent over a year earlier. But the growth has slowed from 15.8 percent throughout last year.

The Bank of Korea forecast exports next year would slow to a rise of 3.2 percent, although private-sector institutes predict risks for a faster slowdown.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>","Canada economic growth slows in third-quarter, December rate hike seen off cards","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economic growth slowed in the third quarter on declines in motor vehicle purchases and housing investment, underpinning market expectations that the Bank of Canada will not hike interest rates next week.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that annualized growth between July and September was 2.0 percent, down from 2.9 percent in the second quarter. The pace of growth matched expectations of analysts in a Reuters poll.
In October, the Bank of Canada - which has hiked rates five times since July 2017 - boosted its estimate of third quarter annualized growth to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent. 
The central bank says interest rates still need to continue rising, given the strength of the economy. Market analysts though see little chance of improvement in the fourth quarter, given the falling price of oil, one of Canada's main exports.
""I'd be shocked if the bank did anything with the rates next week,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Market expectations of an interest rate hike on Dec. 5, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, stayed steady at 11.24 percent. Earlier this month, that figure was above 30 percent.
Although the index showed most market operators believe the bank will tighten again on Jan 9, Porter said in an interview he believed ""it's a closer call than the market is priced for. Today's news reinforces that message.""
Adding to the uncertainty was Statscan data showing the economy shrank 0.1 percent in September from August following seven consecutive months of growth. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a 0.1 percent increase.
""You do have to start asking questions about if the Bank of Canada is going to be able to throw caution to the wind a bit and lift rates in January,"" said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.
The Canadian dollar weakened slightly to C$1.3308, or 75.14 U.S. cents, on the data.
Statscan said that on a non-annualized basis, household spending in the third quarter grew 0.3 percent, down from 0.6 percent in the second, as sales of motor vehicles dropped by 1.6 percent. Total residential investment dipped by 1.5 percent.
Strength in mining and petroleum refineries, boosted by higher prices and foreign demand, helped underpin growth.

On a year-on-year basis, third quarter growth was revised down to show 0.7 percent growth compared with an estimate of 0.8 percent made a month ago.
The 0.1 percent drop in GDP was the first contraction since the second quarter of 2014, ISTAT said.
In the third quarter, the economy was held back by weak domestic demand, with consumer spending falling 0.1 percent from the previous quarter and investments declining by 1.1 percent.
Domestic demand, net of inventory changes, subtracted 0.3 percent from growth, while trade flows contributed positively by a marginal 0.1 percent.
The third quarter contraction continues a steady slowdown in Italian growth over the last 18 months.
Second quarter growth was unrevised at 0.2 percent on the quarter and 1.2 percent year-on-year.
Last month the government, which took office in June, cut the full-year 2018 GDP growth forecast to 1.2 percent from a 1.5 percent projection made in April by the previous administration.
After the third quarter data, achieving even the revised target would need an extremely strong acceleration at the end of the year.
ISTAT said so-called ""acquired growth"" at the end of the third quarter stood at 0.9 percent, meaning that if there is no quarterly growth in the final quarter, full year 2018 expansion come in at 0.9 percent over the previous year.
The new coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League has presented a big-spending 2019 budget it says is needed to prevent Italy's chronically sluggish economy slipping into another recession.
However the budget, which targets the deficit to rise to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2019 from 1.8 percent this year, has been rejected by the European Commission, which wants deficit cuts from highly-indebted Italy, rather than fiscal expansion.
Negotiations between the government and the Commission are ongoing but the two sides still seem far apart. 
ISTAT gave the following details on contributions to quarterly growth in the second and third quarters of this year.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 12:28AM ET</span>",China reports weakest factory growth in over two years on eve of U.S. trade talks,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's vast manufacturing sector stalled for the first time in over two years in November as new orders slowed, piling pressure on Beijing ahead of crucial trade talks between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump this weekend.
If the high-stakes negotiations fail, Trump is widely expected to proceed with a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods in January, which would further strain China's slowing economy and heighten risks to global growth. 
Friday's downbeat factory activity reading suggested a flurry of stimulus measures by Beijing in recent months has yet to be felt, adding to views that business conditions in China will likely get worse before they get better. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), fell to 50 in November, missing market expectations and down from 50.2 in October. It was the weakest reading in 28 months.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast little change from October's already marginal growth levels. The 50-point mark is considered neutral territory, indicating no expansion in activity or contraction on a monthly basis. 
""Manufacturing is now swerving oh so dangerously close to contraction territory - this will add further fuel to the global slowdown narrative which is taking hold,"" Stephen Innes, head of Asia Pacific trading at OANDA, wrote in a research note.
The Trump administration has pointed to growing signs of economic weakness in China and its slumping stock market as proof that the United States is winning the trade war.
Trump sent mixed signals on Thursday about the prospects for a trade deal with China, saying an agreement was close but he was not sure if he wanted one right now.
Trump and Xi will have dinner on Saturday on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Buenos Aires, their first meeting since the world's largest economies began imposing tariffs on each other's goods earlier this year. So far, neither side has indicated any intention of making major concessions.
In a commentary accompanying the latest data, the NBS said China's exports and imports faced growing downward pressure with increasing uncertainty stemming from trade frictions.
CHINA FACING DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL RISKS 
Even if a trade ceasefire is reached, the latest data suggested China's economy will continue to weaken in coming months, with new orders faltering both at home and abroad.
The new orders sub-index -- an indicator of future activity -- declined to 50.4 from 50.8, with export orders shrinking for a sixth straight month.
Reflecting growing concerns over domestic demand, Chinese factories continued to cut back on their import orders for foreign goods last month. Production growth remained modest but was slightly weaker than in October.
Adding to pressure on manufacturers, factory-gate prices fell sharply amid softer demand, hurting profitability for sectors from petroleum processing to ferrous metal smelting. The factory-gate price sub-index pointed to a contraction for the first time since March.
Profit growth for China's industrial powerhouses cooled for a sixth straight month in October. 
MORE POLICY SUPPORT EXPECTED
A sister survey released by the NBS on Friday showed growth in China's service sector moderated in November, but remained at solid levels. That is likely to cushion China's slowdown somewhat, as services account for more than half of the economy.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 53.4 from 53.9 the previous month, with overall business confidence falling to 54.2 from 56.4 in October.
China's policymakers are widely expected to launch more policy support and stimulus measures in coming months if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate and earlier steps prove slower-than-expected to kick in.
The central bank has slashed banks' reserve requirements four times already this year to free up more money to lend to struggling firms, with more cuts expected soon.
Economists at ING forecast the central bank will cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) every quarter in 2019 to save private firms and avoid major job losses, if the trade war with the United States continues to escalate.
In recent weeks, speculation has also swirled over whether China may be considering its first benchmark interest rate cut in three years to give a more forceful push to activity, though that would risk adding to a mountain of debt and pressure the yuan currency.
Capital Economics, which has long predicted a benchmark rate cut, recently forecast China's central bank will start cutting the reverse repo rate in coming weeks to support growth.
""For now, the official PMIs suggest that policy easing is still struggling to put a floor beneath growth,"" the consultancy wrote in a note.
Friday's survey for the services sector also showed cooling momentum in the construction sector, which the NBS attributed to colder weather.
Regulators have been fast tracking infrastructure approvals to lift investment growth from record lows, but analysts say funding remains a concern and the moves may not put a floor under economic growth until the middle of next year.

While China is still expected to hit its official growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, some analysts believe that will cool to as low as 6 percent in 2019, the weakest expansion the country has seen in nearly 30 years.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 02:39PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending rises strongly, inflation moderates","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in seven months in October, but underlying price pressures slowed, with an inflation measure tracked by the Federal Reserve posting its smallest annual increase since February.
The strong consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday probably keeps the U.S. central bank on track to raise interest rates next month for the fourth time this year. But moderating inflation, if sustained, could temper expectations on the pace of rate hikes in 2019. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday appeared to signal the central bank is nearing an end to its interest-rate increases, saying its policy rate was now ""just below"" a level that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy economy. 
Powell has faced intense criticism from President Donald Trump, who has viewed the rate hikes as undercutting the White House's economic and trade policies. 
""The Fed will be in a quandary if the deceleration in core inflation persists,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 0.6 percent last month as households spent more on prescription medication and utilities, among other goods and services. 
Data for September was revised down to show spending rising 0.2 percent instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.4 percent in October. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components edged up 0.1 percent after increasing 0.2 percent in September. 
That lowered the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.8 percent, the smallest rise since February, from 1.9 percent in September. 
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.
Minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting published on Thursday showed nearly all officials agreed another rate increase was ""likely to be warranted fairly soon,"" but also opened debate on when to pause further hikes.
U.S. stocks were trading lower after Wednesday's rally, which was sparked by Powell's comments on interest rates. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
ECONOMY SLOWING 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending advanced 0.4 percent in October, also the biggest gain in seven months and pointing to a solid pace of consumption early in the fourth quarter. 
Despite the strong consumer spending, there are signs that economic growth is slowing. Data this month suggested a cooling in business spending on equipment, a deterioration in the trade deficit as well as further weakness in the housing market. 
A separate report on Thursday from the Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits increased to a six-month high last week, potentially hinting at a slowdown in job growth.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Nov. 24, the highest level since the mid-May. Claims have now risen for three straight weeks. Difficulties adjusting the data around holidays such as Thanksgiving Day, could have boosted claims. 
Economists said the increase in filings was unsurprising given the ongoing financial market volatility, the fading stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut and the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy.
""We view the increase in claims as consistent with the recent increase in financial market stress and the ebbing in fiscal stimulus,"" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""Gains in employment in the coming months should still be well above levels needed to keep the unemployment rate steady."" 
The unemployment rate is near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent. Job gains have averaged 212,500 per month this year. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are currently around a 2.6 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the July-September quarter.
In October, spending on goods surged 0.5 percent after gaining 0.1 percent in September. Outlays on services shot up 0.7 percent after rising 0.3 percent the prior month. 
With wages rising modestly last month, the current pace of consumer spending is unlikely to be sustainable. Still, cheaper gasoline, thanks to tumbling oil prices, is seen supporting consumption as the boost from the tax cut wanes.
Last month, personal income increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since January, after rising 0.2 percent in September. Income growth was probably driven by the government bailing out farmers caught up in the trade war between the United States and China.
Wages rose 0.3 percent in October, matching September's gain. Savings slipped to $967.8 billion last month, the lowest level since December 2017, from $976.9 billion in September.

""With special factors at work, the best we can conclude is that the consumer is still spending but households are not flush,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Unless wage gains accelerate, the early part of next year could be ugly as households cut back to pay for their holiday excesses.""

""Members continued to expect that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" the Fed's minutes showed.
The Fed kept its benchmark rate in a range of 2% to 2.25% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Nov. 8, but signaled a plan for further rate hikes in a bid to keep inflation in check.
While the minutes underlined the Fed's plans to continue with gradual rate hikes, some Fed members expressed uncertainty about the timing of hikes.
""A few participants, while viewing further gradual increases in the target range of the federal funds rate as likely to be appropriate, expressed uncertainty about the timing of such increases,"" the minutes said.
The minutes also highlighted continued debate among Fed members about how close interest rates are to neutral amid fears that an overshoot could slow down the economy.
""A couple of participants noted that the federal funds rate might currently be near its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could unduly slow the expansion of economic activity and put downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations,"" the minutes read.
The release of the minutes comes a day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that interest rates were ""just below"" neutral, dampening the optimism for a more aggressive rate-hike cycle.
Powell’s remarks represent a dovish tilt away from the hawkish tone that had sent equity markets tumbling last month, when he said rates were far from neutral and hinted at a possible overshoot.
The minutes did little to alter odds for December rate hike, with more than 80% of traders expecting the Fed to raise rates for a fourth time this year on Dec. 19, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. 
Markets were encouraged by the minutes. After spending the day in the red, the S&P 500 moved into green territory following the release."

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its pending home sales index, which measures signed contracts for homes where transactions have not yet closed, decreased 2.6% to a reading of 102.1 after rising by 0.7% in the previous month.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising by 0.8% last month.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun noted that it was the tenth straight month of declines and said that ""the recent rise in mortgage rates have reduced the pool of eligible homebuyers"".
Despite the uncertainty regarding the short-term outlook, Yun stressed that he is “very optimistic” about the long-term outlook as the current home sales level matched sales in 2000.
“However, mortgage rates are much lower today compared to earlier this century, when mortgage rates averaged 8%. Additionally, there are more jobs today than there were two decades ago,” Yun said.
“So, while the long-term prospects look solid, we just have to get through this short-term period of uncertainty,” he explained.
Yun also voiced his opinion that the Federal Reserve should be less aggressive in increasing interest rates as the decline in oil and gasoline prices meant inflationary pressure was diminishing.
“Looking at the broader economy and keeping in mind that the housing sector is a great contributor to the economy, it would be wise for the Federal Reserve to slow the raising of rates to see how inflation develops,” he concluded."

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers' confidence fell to its lowest level in almost a year as their view of the economic outlook for the next 12 months sank to its weakest since shortly after 2016's Brexit vote, a survey showed on Thursday.
The GfK consumer sentiment index fell to -13 in November from -10 in October, the lowest reading since December 2017 and below economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll.
The market research company published the data earlier than its planned release time of 0001 GMT on Friday after the news was released early by an industry publication.
While spending from consumers fueled robust economic growth in mid-2018, helped by a hot summer and the soccer World Cup, GfK's report adds to signs the economy is slowing ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union in March next year.
Bank of England data earlier on Thursday showed the weakest consumer borrowing growth in more than three years.
Earlier this month Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a Brexit divorce deal in principle with the EU but she faces broad opposition from lawmakers in her own party and outside, which has shaken investors' confidence in Britain. 
All the components in Thursday's survey dropped, including a steep fall in major purchase intentions -- something that bodes poorly for retailers in the run-up to the crucial Christmas holiday trading season.
Consumers' confidence in the economy over the next 12 months fell to its lowest level since shortly after the Brexit vote, one of the weakest readings since the global financial crisis. 
""The next few weeks are highly unlikely to inject any festive cheer, especially if Theresa May's Brexit deal doesn't win backing from (lawmakers),"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said.
Parliament is due to vote on the deal on Dec. 11.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 220,000 in the latest week. 
The claims data included Thanksgiving Day on Thursday. Claims tend to be volatile around holidays. The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,750 to 223,250 last week.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 50,000 to 1.71 million for the week ended Nov. 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 19,750 to 1.68 million.
The continuing claims data covered the week during which households were surveyed for November's unemployment rate. The four-week average of claims increased 20,750 between the October and November survey weeks, suggesting little change in the unemployment rate.

With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB last month confirmed its plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro ($3 trillion) bond-buying program at the end of this year and raise interest rates for the first time since 2011 sometime after next summer.
The ECB's goal is to keep inflation in the euro zone close to, but just below, two percent a year.
The annual inflation rate in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, was unchanged at 2.4 percent, preliminary regional statistics office data showed.
This is the highest reading since October 2011.
In Bavaria, the second-most populous state, and in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the third, annual inflation was measured at 2.7 percent after 2.8 percent in the previous month.
The state inflation readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, feed into nationwide data due at 1300 GMT.
A poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested Germany's harmonized consumer price inflation (HICP) rate would slow to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent in October, which was the highest reading since February, 2012.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian companies have hiked spending plans for the coming year, with non-mining investment leading the way in a positive omen for the economy, data showed on Thursday.
During the September quarter, though, investment eased 0.5 percent to A$29.5 billion ($21.6 billion), the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed.
That lagged forecasts for a 1.0 percent gain, but that was only because the previous quarter was revised sharply higher to show a fall of 0.9 percent from a 2.5 percent drop earlier.
Importantly, spending on equipment, plant and machinery grew 2.2 percent and will prove a boost to economic growth in the third quarter.
Figures due next week are likely to show Australia's A$1.8 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by anywhere from 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent in the quarter.
Analysts were closely watching the spending outlook, which showed firms were more optimistic about coming year.
The latest estimate for 2018/19 came in at A$114 billion, 11 percent higher than the previous estimate and above most analysts' expectations of around A$104-A$112 billion.
Business investment turned a corner in 2017 after years of decline caused by the end of a once-in-a-generation mining boom.
As Australia tries to meet the need of its ballooning population, public investment is in a strong upswing, with flow-through effects on the non-mining sector.
The past year has seen a long-awaited, and very welcome, surge in non-mining investment with 16 out of 17 industries increasing spending.
The revival has boosted policymakers' optimism about the A$1.8 trillion economy, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) forecasting above trend growth of more than 3 percent over the next couple of years.
Kristina Clifton, an economist at CBA, noted utilities had led the way with investment up no less than 75 percent in the year to June, compared to the previous 12 months, driven by a boom in the renewables sector.
""There is a large pipeline of work still to come which means that investment in renewable energy is likely to remain at a high level over the next few years,"" said Clifton.
Also strong have been health, tourism and education, with the latter two benefiting from an influx of Chinese visitors and students.

654,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>","Japan retail sales rise most in 10 months, signal economic rebound","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales grew the fastest in 10 months in October as consumers shelled out more on fuel, cars, medicines and cosmetics, in a sign firm private consumption is likely to put the economy back on track for growth.
The 3.5 percent annual gain in retail sales in October from a year earlier handily beat the median estimate for a 2.6 percent increase and follows a revised 2.2 percent rise in September.
It was the fastest annual gain since last December.
Retail sales are a key barometer for the strength of private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the Japanese economy. The data confirmed they have risen for a full straight year, reflecting a tight labor market and gradual wage growth.
Policymakers are counting on a rise in private consumption to help accelerate inflation to the central bank's 2 percent target, as core consumer prices have risen just at half the price target despite more than five years of its massive monetary stimulus.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales grew 1.2 percent in October versus a revised 0.1 percent gain in the previous month, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Thursday.
It marked a fifth straight month of monthly gains, and was the biggest increase since June.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, shrank more than expected in the third quarter, hit by natural disasters and sluggish exports.
But a flurry of data due this week, including factory output and jobless figures, is expected to reinforce consensus views that the contraction was temporary.
The economy is widely expected to return to growth in the current quarter, though the strength of that rebound is still up for debate. Slowing global demand and the intensifying U.S.-China trade war are clouding the outlook for export-reliant Japan.

Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in two years in November and new orders contracted for the first time since September 2016, a preliminary survey showed on Monday.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. third-quarter growth unrevised; headwinds increasing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed in the third quarter as previously reported, but the pace was likely strong enough to keep growth on track to hit the Trump administration's 3 percent target this year, even as momentum appears to have moderated further early in the fourth quarter.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP growth. That was unchanged from its estimate in October and well above the economy's growth potential, which economists estimate to be about 2 percent.
The unrevised third-quarter GDP reading reflected a faster pace of inventory accumulation and more business spending on equipment than initially thought that was offset by downward revisions to consumer spending and exports. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent pace in the April-June quarter. 
Strong growth last quarter likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates in December for the fourth time this year, despite an escalation of criticism from President Donald Trump that tighter monetary policy is slowing down the economy.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a Economic Club of New York luncheon on Wednesday that he expected solid growth, low unemployment and inflation near the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
""There is a great deal to like about this outlook,"" Powell said.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. 
Growth is being driven by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which has given consumer spending a jolt and supported business investment. The fiscal stimulus is part of measures adopted by the White House to boost annual growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis.
An alternative measure of economic growth, gross domestic income (GDI), increased at a rate of 4.0 percent in the third quarter, quickening from the second quarter's 0.9 percent pace.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 3.8 percent rate in the July-September period, up from a 2.5 percent growth pace in the second quarter.
The income side of the growth ledger was buoyed by after-tax corporate profits, which increased at a 3.3 percent rate last quarter after rising at a 2.1 percent pace in the April-June period.
But dark clouds are gathering over the economic expansion that is now in its ninth year and the second longest on record. The goods trade deficit widened further in October, pressured by declining exports of soybeans, capital goods and automobiles, the Commerce Department said in another report on Wednesday.
WEAK HOUSING MARKET
New home sales tumbled in October, the latest indication that the housing market was softening because of higher interest rates, a third report showed. 
Data released last week showed business spending on equipment weakening in October and it could remain tepid with Brent crude oil prices slumping by more than 30 percent from a four-year high above $86 in early October. Cheaper oil tends to hurt investment in the energy sector because of reduced profits.
General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Monday that it would cut thousands from its North American workforce, slash production and eliminate some slow-selling car models, which could have ripple effects on the domestic economy.
Growth estimates for the fourth-quarter are currently around a 2.5 percent pace. Economists expect GDP growth to slow further in 2019 as the fiscal stimulus fades and the effects of a bitter trade war with China as well as a strong dollar take their toll.
""Growth will slow in the near term,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh. ""A trade war remains the biggest downside risk.""
The third-quarter growth slowdown mostly reflected the impact of Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, including soybeans. Farmers front-loaded shipments to China before the tariffs took effect in early July, boosting second-quarter growth. Since then, soybean exports have declined every month, increasing the trade deficit. 
Imports increased a bit faster in the third quarter than previously estimated while the drop in exports was much sharper. The resulting larger trade gap sliced off 1.91 percentage points from GDP growth in the third quarter, instead of the 1.78 percentage points reported last month. That was the most since the second quarter of 1985.
Imports were driven by strong domestic demand and a rush by businesses to stockpile before U.S. import duties, mostly on Chinese goods, came into effect late in the third quarter.
Imports subtract from GDP growth. But some of the imports likely ended up in warehouses, adding to the stockpile of inventory, which contributed to GDP. 
Inventories increased at an $86.6 billion rate, instead of the $76.3 billion rate estimated in October. Inventory investment added 2.27 percentage points to GDP growth. That was more than the 2.07 percentage points reported last month and was the biggest contribution since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.6 percent rate in the third quarter, down from the 4.0 percent rate estimated in October.

Business spending on equipment rose at a 3.5 percent rate, instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent rate. That was still the slowest pace in two years. The moderation in business spending has been blamed on the import tariffs, which are increasing manufacturing costs for companies.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales drop to more than 2-1/2-year low,"WASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes tumbled to a more than 2-1/2-year low in October amid sharp declines in all four regions, further evidence that higher mortgage rates were hurting the housing market.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales dropped 8.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000 units last month. That was the lowest level since March 2016. The percent drop was the biggest since December 2017.
September's sales pace was revised higher to 597,000 units from the previously reported 553,000 units. New home sales have dropped in four of the last six months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.4 percent of housing market sales, rising 3.7 percent to a pace of 575,000 units in October. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They decreased 12.0 percent from a year ago. 
Data last week showed moderate increases in homebuilding and sales of previously owned homes in October. The housing market is taking a hit from higher borrowing costs, further pushing homeownership out of the reach of many workers.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently at 4.81 percent, not far from a seven-year high of 4.94 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
While house price inflation is slowing as demand for home purchases cools, it continues to outpace wage growth. House prices increased 5.1 percent year-on-year in September. In contrast wages rose 3.1 percent in October from a year ago.
House price growth has been driven by an acute shortage of properties available for sale.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, declined 7.7 percent to their lowest level since July 2017. Sales fell 3.2 percent in the West and plunged 18.5 percent in the Northeast to their lowest level since September 2015. They tumbled 22.1 percent to a 2-1/2-year low in the Midwest.
The median new house price fell 3.1 percent to $309,700 in October from a year ago. There were 336,000 new homes on the market in October, the most since January 2009 and up 4.3 percent from September. Supply is, however, just over half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom in 2006.
At October's sales pace it would take 7.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the most since February 2011, from 6.5 months in September.

Nearly two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

659,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Third-Quarter GDP Confirmed at 3.5%,"Investing.com - The U.S. grew 3.5% in the third quarter according to data released Wednesday, confirming an initial estimate and leaving the American economy on track for its best yearly expansion since 2005.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that GDP registered a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 3.5% growth in the three-month period from July to September. That was just lower than economists’ expectations for a rise to 3.6%.
Analysts expect the robust expansion to continue in the fourth quarter - although likely at a slower rate - amid forecasts that growth will also moderate in 2019 due to the possible fallout from simmering trade disputes, particularly between the U.S. and China.
The most recent IHS Markit surveys on business activity pointed to growth of 2.5% in the last three months of the year, matching the current forecast from the Atlanta Fed.
“The US economy has performed really well this year with a robust jobs market and massive tax cuts helping to generate the strongest year of GDP growth since 2005. But maintaining this momentum in 2019 will be hard, given the headwinds of the lagged effects of the strong dollar and higher interest rates along with the fading support from the fiscal stimulus and intensifying trade protectionism at a time of softer global growth,” ING chief international economist James Knightley said.
Chris Williamson, IHS Markit’s chief business economist, also signaled that the slowdown may already be underway as companies grew somewhat less optimistic about the outlook in November and decreased growth in hiring.
“Goods exports also appear to also be coming under increasing pressure, often linked to trade wars having dampened demand,” he added."
660,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>",Meager growth seen for China's factories in November as U.S. weighed more tariffs: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factories likely struggled to grow for a second straight month in November as cooling demand at home and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs stifled new orders, a Reuters poll showed, adding to risks facing the global economy.
The official survey on Friday will offer the first clues on the health of China's vast manufacturing sector this month, a day ahead of high-stakes talks between U.S. and Chinese leaders which will determine the future of the countries' trade war. 
Exporters in China have been hit by fresh U.S. tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese products since late September, and Washington has threatened to sharply hike duties on Jan. 1 unless Beijing accedes to a wide range of demands to correct what Washington describes as ""unfair"" trade practices.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for November is expected to come in at 50.2, just above the neutral mark of 50, despite increased government investment in infrastructure and export subsidies, according to the median forecast of 38 economists in a Reuters poll. 
That would mark the second month of only marginal expansion, after growth hit a 27-month low of 50.2 in October.
Economists surveyed appeared more pessimistic, with the most downbeat forecast dropping to 49.8 from 50.3 last month. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. 
""More recently, we have picked up some signs indicating further downside for corporate and government cash flow growth, as the downward trend has become more pronounced for asset prices and producer price inflation (PPI),"" analysts from China International Corporation (CICC) wrote in a report on Wednesday.
A private survey - the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, is expected to show growth stalled in November, dipping to 50 from 50.1 in October. 
The readings would add to worries about slowing momentum globally. China's manufacturing sector last contracted in July 2016. 
Activity in China was already starting to cool before the trade dispute heated up, with a regulatory crackdown on riskier lending and debt making it harder for companies to obtain credit and raising their borrowing costs.
Exports have been surprisingly resilient as shippers rush out goods to beat U.S. tariffs, but orders have been slumping for months, raising the risk of a sharp drop soon if the U.S. raises tariffs as planned.
China's supply chains are being snarled, and some companies are weighing moving production offshore to cheaper locations, anecdotal reports show. 
Profit growth at China's industrial firms cooled for a sixth straight month in October as factory prices and sales softened amid uncertainties stemming from the trade dispute.
While both Beijing and Washington say they are open to talks, few market watchers expect a major breakthrough when presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet on Saturday after a G20 summit in Argentina. Neither has indicated any intention of making major concessions.
China is expected to focus on persuading Trump to postpone the tariff rate increase and any new tariff measures.
Bank of Singapore sees a 50 percent chance of no deal, a 45 percent chance of a temporary ceasefire while the two sides keep talking and only a 5 percent likelihood of a resolution.
""Some U.S. demands, like industrial policy, are deemed to be mostly non-negotiable by the Chinese and would also, as a practical matter, take significant time to plan and implement even if Chinese policy makers made an earnest effort,"" it said in a note to clients on Tuesday. 
A weak factory reading would reinforce the consensus view that China's policymakers will roll out more support and stimulus measures soon on top of a raft of recent initiatives.
Weak October credit data suggested companies are in no mood to make fresh investments as business conditions deteriorate, leaving more of the heavy lifting to government spending, which will take time to be kick in.
The economy grew by a slower-than-expected 6.5 percent in the third quarter, its weakest pace since the global crisis.

The official PMI survey is due out on Nov. 30, along with a sister survey on services. The Caixin manufacturing PMI will come out on Dec. 3 and its services PMI on Dec. 5.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is expected to post solid export growth this month, but faces growing risks from softening computer memory prices and the US-China trade dispute, a Reuters poll found on Wednesday. 
The survey of 11 economists produced a median forecast for exports to rise 6.6 percent in annual terms, well down from a 22.7 percent rise in October but in line with average growth of 6.4 percent so far this year.
Imports are seen jumping 12.0 percent in November over a year earlier, compared with a 6.7 percent rise in October and average growth of 17.3 percent growth so far this year, the survey showed. However, economists said falling computer memory prices and slowing global growth, as well US-China trade disputes were a threat to South Korean exports. 
""Export growth may have slowed slightly in November due to weaker global demand and peaking of the electronics cycle,"" said DBS economist Ma Tieying.""The impact of (U.S.-China trade war) may only show up in the regional trade numbers from the first quarter of 2019 onwards.""
South Korea is home to world-wide suppliers of chips, ships, cars and petroleum products, and is the first major exporter to report its monthly trade data, providing an early scan of global economic health. 
In the same poll, economists also forecast consumer inflation in November would accelerate to an annual rate of 2.2 percent from 2.0 percent in October.
Industrial output in October was estimated to have turned to monthly growth of 1.1 percent from a 2.5 percent fall in September, the poll found.

The figures point to further weakening in China's vast manufacturing sector and economy days ahead of a high stakes meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, which Beijing hopes could avert a major escalation in their trade dispute. 
China and the United States have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods, hurting manufacturing and casting a shadow on the outlook for global growth. 
Industrial profits rose 3.6 percent in October from a year earlier to 548 billion yuan ($78.92 billion), a 7-month low and a slowing from September's 4.1 percent gain, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Tuesday. 
The slowdown was largely due to cooling factory-gate inflation and a high-base effect, bureau official He Ping said in a statement.
Some economists believe profitability will continue to deteriorate in coming months. 
""As the economy slows, profits will only get worse before they get better,"" said Yang Yewei, an analyst with Southwest Securities, who forecast an actual decline in 2019's first quarter.
Nomura economists said the trend will remain down ""given weakening domestic demand, already-high financing costs, rising credit defaults and the escalation in the China-US trade conflict"".
Factory-gate inflation has been easing in recent months on sluggish demand, despite government efforts to shore up the economy, including a flurry of credit-easing measures to boost lending to private firms and ramp up infrastructure spending.
TRADE WAR WORRIES
October's profit data came out as worries about the U.S.-China war were deepened by Trump's comments to the Wall Street Journal before his meeting with Xi Jinping in Argentina at the end of this week.
On Monday, Trump told the newspaper it was ""highly unlikely"" he would accept Beijing's request to hold off on increasing tariffs on $200 million of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, as planned for Jan. 1.
China faces slower economic growth thanks to the trade war plus efforts to rein in financial risks and tackle pollution problems.

Profits earned by state-owned enterprises grew 20.6 percent in October from a year earlier, from 23.3 percent in September.
Shenzhen Energy Group (SZ:000027), the southern Chinese city's largest power producer whose main products include electric power, gas and steam, reported a 83.3 percent decline in net profit for the third quarter.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Foreign buyers find U.S. Treasuries less appealing,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some overseas investors appear to be taking a pass on U.S. debt securities just as the administration of President Donald Trump embarks on a record sale of Treasury bills, notes and bonds to pay for its big tax cuts and spending increases.
Top foreign holders of Treasuries like China and Japan have shrunk their portfolios of U.S. government bonds this year, and a recent barometer of participation in Treasury auctions suggests overseas buyers have not been showing up in force, according to Treasury Department data.
Some auctions since late October had the weakest foreign participation rates in nearly a decade, a Reuters analysis of U.S. Treasury sales shows. At the same time, auction sizes are rising fast, with bond issuance this quarter projected to set a record of $83 billion after deducting maturing debt. 
""We do worry about where demand for Treasuries is going to come from, given the ongoing significant increase in supply,"" said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
That concern will be on sovereign debt investors' minds this week with the Treasury scheduled to auction $129 billion in notes with maturities ranging from two to seven years beginning on Monday.
Foreign investors - both private funds and official entities such as central banks - have been lynchpin participants in the $15.3 trillion U.S. Treasury market for years. And while overall foreign holdings have remained steady at roughly $6.2 trillion, their participation has not grown materially in several years.
The Treasury market, meanwhile, has mushroomed in size, leaving foreigners to account for just 40.5 percent of the market as of September versus nearly 50 percent in January 2013.
A sustained slackening in foreign demand for Treasuries could hurt the U.S. economy. Lower demand means the government must increase the interest it pays out to attract buyers. Those higher federal borrowing costs not only add to the U.S. budget deficit, they also tend to push lending rates higher for consumers and corporations, which could knock the second-longest U.S. economic expansion off track.

CHINA, JAPAN SEEN PULLING BACK
China and Japan, the two biggest holders with more than $1 trillion each, have been scaling back their Treasuries portfolios for much of the year. The latest data showed their Treasuries ownership has dropped to their lowest since June 2017 and October 2011, respectively.
Analysts say the drop in Beijing's holdings stems in large part from spending foreign currency reserves to defend the weakening yuan amid signs of slowing domestic growth, although they do not rule out the possibility it might also be retaliation for Trump's barrage of tariffs on Chinese goods.
""Holdings have declined over the past four months and may continue to do so as the ongoing trade war sours the relationship between China and the U.S. and thus reduces their appetite for Treasuries,"" Jefferies LLC senior money market strategist Tom Simons wrote in a research note.

DIRECT BIDDING
More recently, a drop in so-called ""direct bidder"" participation at auctions has set off more alarms. Direct bidders are a select group of buyers allowed to place orders directly with the government rather than through Wall Street firms, a group that includes China. 
""Direct bids have been exceptionally low,"" said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. ""There's been a collapse, absolutely.""
Earlier this month, the Treasury awarded direct bidders just 3 percent of $37 billion in three-year note supply, this group's smallest share at an auction of this maturity in nine years. 
Direct bidders bought an equally small share of a record-sized $19 billion, 30-year bond auction, and ended up with just 1 percent of the $27 billion of 10-year notes sold between the three-year and 10-year auctions. Direct bidding at the earlier auctions of two-, five- and seven-year notes in late October showed similar drops.
One explanation may be that buyers like China could be shifting back to indirect bidding through Wall Street banks. 
At the most recent 10-year auction, indirect bidders won a record 73.83 percent share of the record 10-year supply, suggesting underlying investor demand for longer-dated U.S. debt is holding up for now as worries about global economic growth and steep drops in stock markets stoke demand for what are seen as the world's safest assets.
""Is it a reallocation in demand or a drop in overall demand?"" Canavan asked.

Institutional investors, particularly pension funds and insurance companies, will likely remain heavy buyers of long-dated Treasuries as a stable source of income to meet their payout obligations, analysts said. 
Still, domestic buyers are not likely to absorb the Treasuries supply that foreigners refuse to purchase, analysts said.

""There is increased strain on dealers and domestic buyers to absorb the growing supply,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S rates strategist at TD Securities. ""But someone has to buy the (additional) supply, and it's probably not foreign.""

667,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Bank of Israel raises rates in surprise first hike since 2011,"By Steven Scheer and Ari Rabinovitch
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel, in a surprise move, raised short-term interest rates for the first time in more than seven years on Monday, and indicated that its monetary tightening path will be slow and steady.
Led by acting governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg, the monetary policy committee (MPC) decided to raise the benchmark interest rate <ILINR=ECI> to 0.25 percent from 0.1 percent -- where it had stood since early 2015 -- citing stable inflation and solid economic growth.
""When we look to the future, we see the process of normalization of raising the interest rate is a gradual, cautious process. That's what we see for now,"" Baudot-Trajtenberg told reporters on a conference call.
Just two of the 12 economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rate rise, while 10 others had expected no change. The decision pushed up the shekel, while bond prices fell.
What made the decision particularly surprising was that at the last decision on Oct. 8, the central bank's economists had pushed back expectations for a rate increase to the first quarter of 2019 from the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower than expected inflation.
In all, the bank's staff expects the key rate to end 2019 at 0.5 percent.
Annual inflation held steady at 1.2 percent in October, while an initial estimate of economic growth in the third quarter showed a weaker than forecast annualized 2.3 percent pace -- leading economists to revise down their 2018 estimates slightly from 3.7 percent.
""The timing of the interest rate hike seemed somewhat puzzling,"" said Gil Bufman, chief economist at Bank Leumi, noting that oil prices have slid 30 percent in recent weeks.
At the Oct. 8 meeting, two of the six MPC members voted for a rate rise and the committee stressed an increase could come at any time.
""We were relatively close to making this decision the last time,"" said Baudot-Trajtenberg, the bank's deputy head who has been acting chief since Karnit Flug's five-year term as governor ended in mid-November.
Earlier this month the Israeli cabinet approved Amir Yaron, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, as the new governor. He is expected to be sworn in next month, prior to the next policy meeting on Jan. 7.
""The committee was very aware that we are in a transition period, a period of changing governors ... but like in all previous decisions, the committee members believed decisions must be made based solely on data and economic analyses,"" Baudot-Trajtenberg said.
She noted that Yaron was not told about the rate increase before the decision was made.
SHEKEL GAINS, BONDS DIP
The first increase since mid-2011 comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates three times this year with more hikes expected in 2019, boosting the dollar.
The shekel, which had weakened 3.2 percent against the dollar since the last rates decision, was up 0.5 percent to 3.7120 per dollar from its fixing of 3.7290, while bond prices fell as much as 0.8 percent and key Tel Aviv share indexes gained 1.3 percent.
The Bank of Israel cited inflation that is stabilizing at the lower end of its 1 to 3 percent target range, with a rise in wages and the expansionary fiscal policy expected to ""support the continued entrenchment of inflation within the target"".
""The main risk to this is the possibility of a sharp appreciation of the shekel,"" the central bank said.
It also noted that the economy is growing at a solid pace and that the tight labor market indicates a high level of demand. ""Even after an increase of the interest rate by 0.15 percentage points, monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to support the attainment of policy targets,"" the central bank said.

668,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",WTO's quarterly indicator suggests trade growth slowing further in fourth quarter,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Global growth in merchandise trade is likely to slow further this quarter, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Monday, as it published a quarterly indicator showing declines in all seven of the drivers of trade that it tracks. 
The WTO's quarterly trade outlook indicator showed a reading of 98.6, the lowest since October 2016, reflecting a further loss of momentum since August, when the index was at 100.3. A reading below 100 signals below-trend growth in trade.
The indicator is based on seven drivers - merchandise trade volume in the previous quarter, export orders, international air freight, container port throughput, car production and sales, electronic components and agricultural raw materials.
In the latest reading, electronic components plunged to 93.3 from 102.2 in the previous quarter, while agricultural raw materials slumped to 97.2 from 100.1 and export orders slid to 96.6 from 97.2 in August.
World trade growth has struggled to outpace economic growth since the global financial crisis of 2008, ending a long streak in which trade increased at roughly double the rate of global GDP. 
Trade appeared to be reviving last year when it grew by 4.7 percent, prompting cheery forecasts in April of a further 4.4 percent rise this year and 4.0 percent in 2019.
However, the WTO cut those forecasts in September, following the opening salvoes of a trade war triggered by U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and on goods from China.
The WTO's new forecasts of 3.9 percent growth this year and 3.7 percent in 2019 may still prove optimistic. 
""Risks to the forecast are considerable and firmly weighted to the downside. A further ratcheting up of trade tensions could have direct negative effects on trade, but also beyond,"" the WTO said in a report on G20 trade barriers last week.
""A build-up of economic and financial risks could undermine trade and output and developing and emerging economies could experience capital outflows and financial contagion as developed countries raise interest rates.""
Other potential risks included geopolitical tensions and -- in the medium-to-long term -- ageing populations in developed countries and economic rebalancing in China.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Brazil economy bounces back from strike; strength may be fleeting: Reuters poll,"By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Record-low interest rates and a one-off windfall from the release of pent-up worker savings funds likely helped Brazil's economy bounce back strongly in the third quarter after a nationwide truckers' strike disrupted production earlier in the year, a Reuters poll showed.
Yet newfound strength is likely to ease soon as firms anxiously await clear signs that newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro will address their concerns over a ballooning fiscal deficit that have held back capital spending. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) probably rose 0.8 percent from the second quarter, according to the median of 25 forecasts, the fastest since the first quarter of 2017. 
Even the lowest estimate, of 0.3 percent, would represent an acceleration from the 0.2 percent rate seen in the second quarter, when truckers protesting high diesel prices blocked highways across Brazil, choking off flows to major industries and forcing farmers to cull their flocks and dump milk.
At the other end of the scale, the most optimistic forecaster, HSBC, predicted an expasion of 1.7 percent, which would be the highest rate since the second quarter of 2013.
Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) highlighted that a statistical bounce from the strike, as well as a non-recurring government measure allowing workers to withdraw from inactive severance accounts, accounted for much of the accelerated expansion. 
That measure is estimated to have injected 15 billion reais in the economy this year.
""As the effects of these events should phase out during the last quarter of the year, this strength should be temporary,"" they wrote in a report.
JPMorgan expects Latin America's largest economy to expand only 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, in line with wider market expectations. 
A weekly central bank survey of over a hundred economists put 2018 growth at 1.39 percent, which would imply a fourth-quarter expansion of only 0.3 percent.
This suggests that Brazil's recovery from its deepest recession in decades is likely to remain slow and steady as opposed to fast and furious.
The GDP data, scheduled for Friday at 9:00 a.m. local time (1100 GMT), is expected to show a 1.6 percent expansion from the year before, based on 26 estimates ranging from 1.1 to 2.0 percent. 
All components of demand - consumer spending, investments, government spending and net exports - likely contributed positively to growth in the third quarter, according to most of the 12 economists who replied to additional questions.
Interest rates at all-time lows helped support a recovery in corporate investments, despite uncertainty around October's presidential election. Corporate investments had slumped 1.8 percent in the strike-depressed second quarter versus the previous three months.
While continuously rising government spending did boost growth in the short term, it is likely to crowd out corporate spending in the future -- as has been the case in recent quarters, economists said.
Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker who won the presidency campaigning for a tough stance on crime and corruption, privatizations and deregulation, has pledged to plug the budget deficit in a matter of years.
Yet that would require negotiating an unpopular overhaul of the nation's costly pension reform with a fragmented Congress. 
Contradictory statements from Bolsonaro's own team mean that is hardly a done deal. 
""It's been years since we've been saying that a pension reform is an urgent necessity and that has not changed,"" said Luciano Rostagno, a strategist at Mizuho.

""We're past the point where we can give anyone the benefit of the doubt. Unless we see clear signs that the pension reform will be a reality, companies will not invest, banks will not lend and the economy will remain as sluggish as ever"".

The hit would be the equivalent of losing the economic output of Wales or the contribution of London's financial services industry, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said.
The report was commissioned by People's Vote, a campaign group calling for a new referendum that could keep Britain in the European Union.
Britain's economic growth has slowed since the 2016 Brexit vote, largely in line NIESR's pre-referendum projections of the impact of a 'Leave' vote, but not by as much as many forecasters predicted.
NIESR's latest report predicted that, if Britain strikes a free trade deal with the EU to replace its current membership, by 2030 the lost output would be equivalent to about 1,100 pounds ($1,400) per person per year.
Britain is due to leave the EU in March but, if parliament approves the exit deal, its trading status with the bloc will remain unchanged at least until the end of 2020. 
That transition period could be extended until the end of 2022 as London and Brussels hammer out their new relationship.

Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to overcome opposition within her Conservative Party to the agreement she stuck with Brussels, raising concerns about a no-deal Brexit among businesses and investors.
If Britain leaves the EU in March with no deal, but with some agreements to avoid major disruption to trade and travel, the economy will be 5.5 percent smaller by 2030 than under continued EU membership, NIESR estimated. 
It said the hit would be less if Britain remained in a customs union with the EU -- a backstop option in London's deal with Brussels -- which would leave the economy 2.8 percent smaller by 2030 than if it stayed fully in the bloc.

The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Monday its business climate index fell for the third month in a row to 102.0. This was lower than a Reuters consensus forecast of 102.3.
""Sentiment among German businesses weakened further this month,"" said Ifo chief Clemens Fuest. ""Companies scaled back their assessments of the current business situation albeit from a high level. Their business expectations also clouded over.""
He added that the economy would grow by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter at most after contracting by 0.2 percent in the July-September period.
Reciprocal tariffs on goods imposed by the world's two largest economies are hurting German companies that manufacture in both countries and export in both directions across the Pacific.
The tariffs are not only dampening the business outlook but are starting to leave their mark on Europe's economic powerhouse, which has long depended on exports for growth.
Data last week showed that weaker exports were the primary driver behind the first quarterly contraction since 2015 and economists said there are clear signs that German growth was slowing.
""The index's fall is somewhat alarming,"" Uwe Burkert of LBBW wrote in a note. ""It was generally expected that the economic weakness of the third quarter would be corrected with a firmly positive growth figure in the fourth quarter.""
He added: ""That optimistic picture has been damaged by today's numbers.""
Detailed July-September GDP data on Friday showed exports fell 0.9 percent on the quarter while imports rose 1.3 percent, with net trade knocking a full percentage point off growth. This translated into a third quarter contraction of 0.2 percent.

German private sector growth also hit its lowest level in November in nearly four years as factories churned out goods at a slower pace and activity in services also ebbed, a IHS Market survey showed last week.

The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.8 in November from a final 52.9 in October.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 27th consecutive month.
However, the flash reading was the weakest for a month since November 2016, and a significant drop from October's six-month peak.
""The underlying trend appears to be skewed to the downside,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Indeed, the fall in new orders is a worrying development as easing global growth momentum coupled with a weak domestic backdrop could spell further demand woes for Q4.""
The survey data suggests manufacturers have already begun to pare expectations. They continued to expect output to rise in future, but the degree of optimism declined for a sixth straight month. 
The index for new orders dropped to 49.6 from 52.6 in October, while that for new export orders showed expansion, though at a slower pace.
Output expanded again, according to the flash reading, though it grew less than in October. 
The index for new export orders, a leading indicator of shipments from Japan, slipped to 50.8 from 51.1 the previous month.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, shrank more than expected in the third quarter, hit by natural disasters and sluggish exports.
While the economy is expected to return to growth this quarter as effects from natural disasters fade, slowing global demand and the intensifying U.S.-China trade war cloud the outlook for export-reliant Japan.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",China economic growth seen slowing to 6.3 percent next year: economists,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's economic growth is expected to hit 6.6 percent this year and slow to 6.3 percent in 2019 as the country struggles with challenges relating to trade and structural reform, economists from Beijing's Renmin University said in a report.
The predictions, published by the news service of the China Academy of Social Sciences late on Saturday, are in line with the median forecast in a poll of 73 economists by Reuters last month, with China under increasing pressure from a trade war with the United States.
But the economists with Renmin University's School of Economics warned that China would still face difficulties even if trade tensions with the United States were resolved, with the country facing a deteriorating global trade environment, falling export growth and currency depreciation.
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.5 percent year on year in the September quarter, its slowest quarter of growth since 2009, and Beijing has tried to encourage commercial banks to boost lending to private firms and take action to ease company financing problems.
The economists said it would be difficult to use short-term measures to alleviate downward economic pressures now building in China, and while recent policies should prevent a deeper decline in growth next year, a new round of structural supply-side reforms was needed.
They predicted that 2019 would be critical in the restructuring of China's economy and its long-term transition to a slower and more high-quality growth model.
The report said next year should also see a rebalancing of China's foreign trade, with imports likely to soar 16.1 percent, compared with a 6.1 percent rise in 2018.
Liu Yuanchun, dean of Renmin University's School of Economics and one of the authors, said the steady decline in China's savings rate and the stimulation of domestic consumption was now a more important factor in the country's economic development than investment.

The report said Chinese consumer spending was expected to rise 9 percent next year, outpacing overall growth.

In unadjusted terms, Latin America's second-biggest economy expanded by 2.5 percent compared with a year earlier, which was also one tenth of a point less than a preliminary estimate published on Oct. 30, data from the agency showed.
The statistics agency had initially estimated quarterly growth at 0.9 percent during the third quarter.
A breakdown of the unadjusted data showed that growth during the July-September period was powered by robust expansion in tertiary activities such as retail and services.
Tertiary activities grew by 3.2 percent in real terms from the same period last year, the data showed.
Primary activities, including agriculture, were up by 2.2 percent year-on-year during the quarter, while secondary activities, including manufacturing, mining and construction, advanced by 1.1 percent, the agency's data showed.
The quarterly growth, which was the strongest since the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a slight contraction in the second quarter, data for which were revised up a notch.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate remained above the central bank's target for the ninth straight month in October, data showed on Friday, but markets saw few signs the Bank of Canada would hike interest rates next month.
Statistics Canada said the annual inflation rate edged up to 2.4 percent from 2.2 percent in September. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast it would stay at 2.2 percent. 
The central bank, which has consistently said inflation will move back down toward its 2 percent target by early 2019, is due to announce its next interest rate decision on Dec. 5.
Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said lower prices for oil - one of Canada's main exports - would soon start pulling down inflation.
""We see nothing here to tip the Bank of Canada's hand towards a December hike,"" he said in a phone interview.
Market expectations of an interest rate hike on Dec. 5, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, dipped to 23.20 percent from 23.40 percent. Earlier this month, that figure was above 30 percent. [BOCWATCH]
Two of the three central bank's three core inflation measures posted gains while CPI common, which the bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was unchanged at 1.9 percent.
""I think we're going to see the headline number drop pretty heavily below 2 percent in the November reading,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The Bank of Canada has hiked rates five times since July 2017, and says more increases will be needed. Rates are rising at ""exactly"" the right pace, Governor Stephen Poloz said on Nov. 5.
Prices for travel tours rose 3.0 percent from October 2017 compared with a 4.4 percent year-over-year decline in September. Passenger vehicle prices rose by 1.7 percent compared with a year earlier on lower rebates and a greater variety of models.
The Canadian dollar extended its decline on the data, touching C$1.3244 to the U.S. dollar, or 75.51 U.S. cents.
Separately, Statscan said the value of retail trade rose by 0.2 percent in September from August, in part due to higher sales at food stores. Stripping out the effect of price changes, volumes increased by 0.5 percent.

The forecasts, prepared by the finance ministry for a joint committee of federal and regional governments, comes amid gathering signs that a decade-long expansion in Europe's largest economy is petering out.
Der Spiegel said the forecasts called for the combined surplus of the federal government, the regions, municipalities and social insurance funds to shrink to about 36 billion euros in 2019, or around 1 percent of gross domestic product.

Years of record output growth have had a salutary effect on government finances, however: The ministry forecast sees total public sector debt falling to 58 percent of gross domestic product next year, bringing it below the European Union's 60 percent ceiling for the first time since 2010. It is then expected to slide to 52 percent in 2022.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate has dropped more than expected below the official target's midpoint, reinforcing a view that the central bank can take its time before hiking interest rates from all-time lows.
Consumer prices tracked by the benchmark IPCA index rose 4.39 percent in the 12 months through mid-November, government statistics agency IBGE said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 4.44 percent increase. 
The central bank targets a 4.5 percent year-end rate in 2018 and 4.25 percent in 2019, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.
Lower fuel, power and healthcare costs accounted for the bulk of the deceleration in inflation, offsetting an increase to food prices. When stripped of volatile components, so-called core inflation remained closer to 3.5 percent.
Economists at Capital Economics said the IBGE release suggests policymakers ""won’t be rushed into tightening policy"".
""Overall, there is still little sign of a significant build-up in core price pressures,"" they wrote in a note to clients.
The IPCA index rose 0.19 percent from mid-October, IBGE said, below a median estimate of 0.24 percent.
An underwhelming economic recovery has kept unemployment high, curbing wage gains. Meanwhile, the victory of far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro in the presidential election dispelled concerns over a potential currency selloff that could boost inflation.
Subdued price pressures have driven the central bank to keep rates at an all-time low even as inflation accelerated past this year's target midpoint in recent months.

The central bank last month kept the benchmark Selic rate at 6.50 percent and acknowledged reduced upward risks to inflation. In the minutes of that meeting, which took place just after the election, policymakers said inflation would likely peak in the second quarter of 2019 before easing towards its targets.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Weaker exports were the primary driver behind Germany's first quarterly economic contraction since 2015, data showed on Friday, and while economists called it an aberration, they cited clear signs that Europe's largest economy was cooling.
The GDP data, coupled with news that Germany's private sector growth slowed more than expected, hit the euro and German bond yields in early trading.
""The global economy is weakening, and Germany as an export nation is feeling the brunt of that,"" said Thomas Gitzel, Thomas Gitzel, chief economist of VP Bank Group.
The Federal Statistics Office confirmed a preliminary negative reading of 0.2 percent in the third quarter, the first contraction in the Germany economy since 2015.
Exports fell 0.9 percent on the quarter while imports rose 1.3 percent, with net trade knocking a full percentage point from growth.
""German economic growth has stalled,"" the statistics office said, noting the economy grew just 1.1 percent on the year in the third quarter in calendar-adjusted terms, which take public holidays into account when measuring the number of days worked.
In the second quarter, the growth rate was 2.0 percent by the same measure.
It said investments in heavy machinery, equipment and vehicles rose 0.8 percent from the previous quarter, and as much as 0.9 percent in construction, but private consumption dropped 0.3 percent, mainly due to slow car purchases.
The data confirmed preliminary GDP data released on Nov. 14, with private spending down due to bottlenecks in the car sector stemming from the introduction of vehicle pollution standards, known as WLTP, a factor.
GERMAN PMI DROP
German private sector growth also hit its lowest level in November in nearly four years as factories churned out goods at a slower pace and activity in services also ebbed, the IHS Market survey showed.
The flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 52.2 from 53.4 in October, the lowest reading since December 2014.
Manufacturers reported weaker demand from China, Italy and Turkey, with the sector recording the biggest monthly drop in new exports orders for almost six years, IHS Markit said.
The third-quarter GDP contraction was mainly due to weakness in the car industry as it struggled to adjust to new emission testing requirements. While that issue should not affect the fourth quarter, the industry remains vulnerable to trade disruptions as a result of threatened U.S. tariffs.
Gitzel said the new WLTP pollution test process had ""left massive skid marks in the German car industry and as a result in private consumption and exports"". However, it should have only a temporary effect on consumption and exports.
He said private consumption, investment and construction would continue to fuel economic growth, but cautioned against expecting any massive ""castles in the sky.""
KfW economist Joerg Zeuner said strong growth in imports and rising investment showed continued strength in domestic demand.
""The final quarter should show a noticeable rebound, however beyond that there will not be a return to continued high quarterly growth rates,"" Zeuner said. ""The previously robust economy likely peaked in 2017 and is cooling down.""
The German government expects the economy to grow by 1.8 percent this year and next, well below the calendar-adjusted expansion of 2.5 percent seen in 2017.

Provisional data showed a 3.7 percent increase in the imports of goods and services in the third quarter, compared to a year earlier, with exports rising 1.1 percent in the same period, the statistics office said.

682,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 05:44AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, November 23:
1. Black Friday Puts Retail in the Spotlight 
It’s the day after Thanksgiving and that means a rush of shopping during the global Black Friday retail sales event.
With no earnings on tap, investors will be watching retail stocks for reactions to the promotional activities after a lower-than-expected earnings session for the retail sector.
Black Friday was traditionally when retailers moved into the black for the year as holiday shopping began and is now an annual event that promises long lines and marked down items.
Big-name retailers will be watched closely, even among that those that reported strong numbers, like Walmart (NYSE:WMT). While retailers do not break out numbers for the Black Friday event, retail analysts and social media will be closely watched for estimates of foot traffic, online sales, and popular promotions.
2. Wall Street Closes Early
The stock market closes early on Friday, after markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, with many investors still away.
Wall street looked set to open lower: S&P 500 futures fell 0.40% while Dow futures lost 0.50% and tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures decreased 0.58%.
On Friday, stock markets will close at 1:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT). The bond markets close at 2:00 PM ET.
Trading in Europe was higher, with the DAX, FTSE 100 and CAC 40 all in the green.
Meanwhile in Asia, stocks were mixed at the close. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 0.35%. The Shanghai Composite was down 2.49% while in Japan, the TOPIX rose 0.81% and the Nikkei 225 gained 0.65%.
3. Crypto Prices Continue to Tumble
The only sector not celebrating Black Friday is crypto. Prices continued to tumble on Friday, as regulators in the UK warned investors against digital coin derivatives.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) could ban some crypto-based derivatives, Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said this week.
Virtual coins have fallen dramatically in recent weeks, with Bitcoin falling 75% since its peak of almost $20,000 in December.
Cryptocurrencies overall were lower, with the total coin market capitalization at $141 billion at the time of writing, compared to $147 billion on Thursday. Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) was trading at $4,430.10, having reached a 14-month low of $4,251 during Asian trading.

4. Manufacturing and Services PMI Data Released 
The data calendar will be light on Friday.
Markit is expected to release its preliminary measurements for manufacturing and services activity at 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT).
On average, economists expect the Markit manufacturing purchase managers’ index (PMI) to stay steady compared with October. The November services PMI is forecast to tick up slightly.
5. Oil Prices Fall to Lowest Level Since 2017
Oil prices slumped to their lowest level since 2017 on Friday amid worry of oversupply and concerns over slowing economic growth.
Crude Oil WTI Futures slumped 5%, to $51.83 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude oil futures fell their lowest since October 2017 at $60.45 a barrel.
Data on Wednesday showed that inventories in the U.S. continue to rise more than expected, leading to a concern of oversupply.
U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.9 million barrels last week, compared with the general consensus of a 2.9 million-barrel increase, the EIA reported.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is expected to curb output after a meeting on Dec. 6.
The weekly U.S. Baker Hughes oil rig count, which is a leading indicator of demand for oil products, comes out later in the session."

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was much weaker than expected this month as exports fell sharply, hurt by a slowing global economy and an ongoing United States-led trade war, a survey showed on Friday.
The disappointing readings will likely be of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank who are expected to draw a line under their 2.6 billion euro asset purchase program at the end of the year. [ECILT/EU]
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.4, its lowest since late 2014, from a final October reading of 53.1, missing the median expectation in a Reuters poll for a modest dip to 53.0. The lowest forecast was for 52.3.
However, anything above 50 in the survey, which is regarded as a good guide to economic health, indicates growth.
""This is a symptom of slowing global demand - manufacturing is leading the slowdown. The trade war was widely cited, especially in manufacturing,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
An index measuring new export business, which includes trade within member countries, fell from October's 49.2 to 48.9, the lowest since IHS Markit started collecting the data in September 2014.
The PMI survey contradicts a Reuters poll last week which suggested euro zone growth will bounce back to a faster pace this quarter, allowing the European Central Bank to stop buying bonds next month as planned. [ECILT/EU]
Growth was pegged at 0.4 percent in that poll but Williamson said the PMI pointed to a weaker 0.3 percent rate and could fall to 0.2 percent, depending on how December pans out.
A PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry fell to a 25-month low of 53.1 from October's 53.7.
With no sign of an end to the trade war between the United States and China in sight - something already hitting export-sensitive economies like Germany - optimism took a hit. The business expectations index fell to 60.3 from 62.1, its lowest in almost four years.
Manufacturers also struggled this month and their PMI fell to 51.5 from 52.0, a level not seen since mid-2016. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, was dangerously close to the break-even mark at 50.4, down from 51.3.
It hasn't been below 50 since June 2013.
That slowing growth came as factories ran down old orders at their fastest rate in almost four years. The backlogs of work index fell to 48.4 from 49.0.
Other forward looking indicators also remained subdued.

684,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 03:25AM ET</span>",Soft manufacturing weighs on French business growth in November: PMI,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's private sector struggled to keep up momentum in November as manufacturing activity softened in the face of falling new orders, a monthly survey showed on Friday.
Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary composite purchasing managers index (PMI) fell marginally to 54.0 from 54.1 in October, slightly better than economists average forecast for 53.9 in a Reuters poll.
Though overall business activity remained comfortably above the 50-point threshold between an expansion and a contraction, there was a growing divergence between the services and manufacturing sectors.
Manufacturing activity eased ever closer toward contraction at only 50.7 from 51.2 in October, and a touch below economists' average forecast for 51.0.
Meanwhile, in the larger service sector, PMI eased back to 55.0 - spot on expectations - from 55.3 in October, though IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said the sector's vigor may not hold at those levels for much longer.
""Service companies are struggling to find an pricing power amid relatively sluggish demand, which is being driven by the weakness in manufacturing,"" Williamson said.
""Services are resilient at the moment, but there are downside risks to that, and it's manufacturing that is clearly the key area of concern,"" he added.
New factory orders and hiring in the manufacturing sector contracted in November for the first time in more than two years with export demand softened amid international trade tensions.
Less exposed to foreign demand, the service sector managed to keep up growth by holding down price increases much lower than their input prices, pinching margins.
Hiring growth in the sector, which has been leading a labor market recovery as France's biggest employer, eased to the slowest pace since August 2017.

685,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 12:05AM ET</span>",Singapore October core inflation edges up to 1.9 percent year-on-year,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's core inflation gauge edged higher in October to 1.9 percent from a year earlier due to higher cost of electricity and gas, data showed on Friday. 
It was slightly above the 1.8 percent on-year increase seen in September, and in line with a Reuters poll. 
The central bank's core inflation measure excludes changes in the price of cars and accommodation, which are more influenced by government policies. 

Singapore's headline consumer price index, however, rose less than expected at 0.7 percent in October from a year earlier, unchanged from September. This was slightly below the median forecast in the Reuters poll which called for all-items CPI to rise 0.8 percent.
 
"
686,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 10:45AM ET</span>",Mexico price pressures lower than expected in early November,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican consumer price inflation cooled slightly more than expected during the first half of November, data from the national statistics agency showed on Thursday.
Annual inflation in Latin America's second-biggest economy eased to 4.56 percent in the first two weeks of November from 4.87 percent in the second half of October, the data showed.
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast an inflation rate of 4.61 percent in early November. The latest figure was the lowest half-month inflation rate since the first two weeks of June, according to official data.
Mexico's central bank has flagged concerns over price pressures, and last week raised its benchmark interest rate to a nearly 10-year high of 8.0 percent, warning that the incoming government's policies risked fanning inflation.
The bank targets an inflation rate of 3 percent, with a one percentage point tolerance threshold up or down.
A breakdown of the latest data showed that Mexican consumer prices rose by 0.61 percent during the first half of November compared with the prior month. That compared with a Reuters poll forecast for an increase in prices of 0.66 percent.
The core price index <MXCPIH=ECI>, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.19 percent.

687,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",ECB policymakers united behind stimulus exit plan in Oct: minutes,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers stressed at their meeting in October the need to reaffirm plans to dial back monetary stimulus even as some saw growing risks to the economy, minutes showed on Thursday.
Investors have been questioning the ECB's resolve to follow through on plans to stop its bond purchases at the end of the year and raise interest rates sometime after next summer. 
ECB rate-setters acknowledged the disappointing economic data on Oct 24-25 but took the view that the picture was still one of widespread economic growth and accelerating inflation.
""It was important to emphasize that the incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remained overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation,"" the ECB said in the minutes of the meeting.
The central bank kept rates at record lows at the meeting and repeated its intention to stop adding to its 2.6 trillion euros ($2.97 trillion) of bonds at the end of the year in light of higher inflation. Calls for adopting a more cautious outlook were isolated.
""While there was broad agreement that at present the risks to growth could still be considered to be balanced overall, a remark was made that a number of arguments pointed towards risks to the growth outlook tilting to the downside,"" the ECB said in the accounts.
And the prospect of a new round of cheap, multi-year loans to banks, known as targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), was barely broached.
With the latest TLTRO starting to mature in 2020, ECB President Mario Draghi said two policymakers had brought up the topic at the October meeting.
""The remark was made that the maturity of some of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations would fall below one year in the course of the next year, which could impact the evolution of excess liquidity and might affect banks’ liquidity position,"" the ECB said. 
Sources have told Reuters no decision on the matter is expected in December, either. 
Euro zone banks took up 739 billion euros at the ECB's latest round of TLTRO, in March 2017. So far 14.6 of that has been repaid, with the rest falling due in 2020 and 2021.
That may prove painful in countries such as Italy, where banks have to repay some 250 billion euros worth of TLTRO money amid rising market rates and an unfavorable political situation.

688,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",ECB Minutes Reiterate Plans to Wind Up Stimulus This Year,"Investing.com - Minutes from the European Central Bank's Oct. 25 policy meeting indicated that policymakers are on track to wind up its asset purchase program in December, despite growing concerns over risks to the economic outlook.
Policymakers believe that risks to the euro area outlook were roughly balanced, although some noted that there were “a number of arguments pointed towards risks to the growth outlook tilting to the downside”.
""It was important to emphasise that the incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remained overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation,” the ECB said.
Updated forecasts in December would evaluate the impact of trade developments on the euro zone outlook, the minutes said.
“The December projections would provide an updated assessment of the impact of developments in trade on the outlook for euro area growth, which had been revised down successively in recent staff projection exercises, reflecting to a large extent the impact of external factors.”
The ECB kept interest rates on hold last month and reiterated that they would remain at current levels through the summer of 2019 at the earliest.
At 7:37 AM ET (11:37 GMT), EUR/USD was trading at 1.1411 from around 1.1414 ahead of the release, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8873 from 0.8866 earlier.
The ECB's next monetary policy meeting will take place on Dec. 13."
689,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 04:09AM ET</span>","Japan inflation lacks momentum, keeps BOJ's target elusive","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation was unchanged in October from the previous month as soft household spending kept firms from hiking prices, a sign the economy lacks the momentum needed to achieve the central bank's 2 percent target.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which strips away the effect of volatile food costs, rose 1.0 percent in October from a year earlier, government data showed on Thursday, matching a median market forecast.
With half of the gain due to higher energy costs, the Bank of Japan may face increasing difficulty achieving consistent price growth as global trade frictions and slowing Chinese demand cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy.
In a sign inflationary pressure is barely building up, an index excluding the effect of both fresh food and energy costs showed inflation of 0.4 percent in October, steady for three straight months.
""The data shows it will take quite a long time for inflation to hit the BOJ's target,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The BOJ is unlikely to change its stance"" of maintaining its massive stimulus program, he added.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reassured markets the central bank will ""patiently maintain"" its massive stimulus program as inflation remained distant from his target.
NEW HEADWINDS LOOM
Stubbornly soft inflation has dashed the BOJ's hopes that solid economic growth would translate into higher prices, forcing the central bank to maintain its huge stimulus despite unwelcome side-effects such as the erosion of financial institutions' profits from years of near-zero interest rates.
Despite grumbling over the rising negative impact of its stimulus, the BOJ is likely to keep inflation as its primary policy consideration, sources have told Reuters.
Many analysts expect core consumer inflation to stall at or slow from current levels in coming months, given recent declines in crude oil prices.
The central bank will face additional challenges from one-off factors that could push down consumer prices next year, such as expected cuts in mobile phone charges.
The darkening outlook for Japan's economy also bodes ill for the BOJ's efforts to fire up inflation to its elusive target.
Escalating Sino-U.S. trade frictions are beginning to hurt Japanese business sentiment, stoking fears that any rebound in growth from an economic contraction in July-September could be weaker than expected.
Japan's government maintained its upbeat economic assessment on Thursday but pointed to signs of weaknesses in Asia as trade frictions dim the region's growth outlook.
Overall annual consumer inflation, which includes fresh food and energy costs, ticked up to 1.4 percent in October from 1.2 percent in the previous month, as summer typhoons and rain damaged crops and pushed up vegetable prices.
Analysts say such rises in grocery prices could leave households with less money for non-essential spending, curbing consumption. 
""Underlying trend inflation remains weak, and prices will continue to be swayed by external factors like currency and oil moves,"" said Taro Saito, an economist at NLI Research Institute.

""There's a good chance core consumer inflation will slide below 1 percent by the end of this year.""

Growth is seen easing to 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent in 2019 from a projected range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 2018, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement on Thursday. Gross domestic product for the third quarter disappointed, rising an annualized 3 percent from the second quarter and 2.2 percent from a year ago, lower than the government initially forecast.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 10:12PM ET</span>","Singapore third-quarter GDP growth well below forecast, trade frictions dent outlook","By Fathin Ungku
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy expanded at a much slower pace than initially thought in the third quarter, with the government flagging further moderation in the current quarter and warning that the U.S.-Sino trade war will hurt growth in 2019.
The weakening outlook for the prosperous city-state - a bellwether for global growth because international trade dwarfs its domestic economy - underlines a shakeout in financial markets in recent months as investors worry about world trade, investment and corporate earnings prospects. 
The economy grew 3.0 percent in the July-September quarter from the previous three months on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis, revised final figures from Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) showed on Thursday. 
That was well below the government's initial estimate in October of 4.7 percent growth and also a median forecast of 4.2 percent in a Reuters poll of 11 analysts. In the second quarter, the economy expanded 1 percent.
The weaker than expected economic momentum in the third quarter was largely driven by slackening in the manufacturing sector, a factor that looks set to keep policy makers cautious given the worsening international trade environment and the Sino-U.S. tariff row. 
""We did expect industrial production growth to moderate. But the pace of moderation was more prominent than initially thought,"" UOB economist Alvin Liew said.
The city-state's manufacturing sector grew at 3.5 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, slowing sharply from 10.7 percent growth in the quarter earlier. 
SLOWER GROWTH IN 2019
On a year-ago basis, gross domestic product grew 2.2 percent in the third quarter, slower than the advance estimate of 2.6 percent growth, and below a 2.4 percent rise forecast in the Reuters poll. 
The MTI revised its forecast for GDP growth for 2018 to 3.0 to 3.5 percent, from 2.5 to 3.5 percent previously. It gave a wide range for 2019's GDP growth forecast of between 1.5 to 3.5 percent. 
""The external demand outlook for the Singapore economy in 2019 is slightly weaker as compared to 2018. At the same time, risks in the global economy are tilted to the downside,"" Loh Khum Yean, permanent secretary for trade and industry said.
Singapore's policymakers have repeatedly warned that a heated trade war between the United States and China - one of the city state's major trade partners - could hurt the domestic economy.
""There is the risk of a further escalation of the ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and its key trading partners, which could trigger a sharp fall in global business and consumer confidence,"" Loh said.
Export growth to China has slowed for 5 months in a row, raising worries about the outlook as the Sino-U.S. trade tensions showed no signs of abating.
A Singapore central bank official told reporters at a news briefing following the data release that the inflation and monetary policy outlook remains unchanged. 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore, which manages policy through changes to the exchange rate rather than interest rates, has tightened monetary settings at both of its semi-annual meetings this year, most recently in October. 
Analysts at Capital Economics cautioned of further pressure on the economy from steady interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""Looking ahead, the outlook for Singapore's economy will depend in large part on the prospects for the global economy,"" they said.

""Local interest rates are already at their highest since the global financial crisis and are likely to increase further if the U.S. Fed continues to raise rates, as we expect.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales rose slightly in October and snapped a six-month streak of drops but ongoing weakness in the housing market led a national realtors association to ask the Federal Reserve to take a break from interest rate hikes.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that existing home sales rose 1.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.22 million units last month.
While that was up slightly from a 5.15 million-unit pace in September, it remained 5.1 percent lower than in October 2017, the sharpest 12-month drop since July 2014.
NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said rate increases by the Federal Reserve, which has been slowly raising borrowing costs since December 2015, was dragging on the market.
""Demand is being choked off by higher interest rates,"" Yun said. ""Maybe the Federal Reserve can take a little pause in their interest rate hikes to give the chance for the housing market to be on firmer ground.""
Home sales had fallen in each of the six prior months. A dearth of properties for sale has pushed up prices, sidelining many would-be homeowners. 
Data on Tuesday showed homebuilding rose in October on a rebound in multi-family starts but construction of single-family homes fell for a second straight month, underscoring how rising mortgage rates and rising home prices have been sapping demand.
Supply has also been constrained by rising building material costs as well as land and labor shortages.
The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs in September for the third time this year and is widely expected to hike rates again in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales rising to 5.20 million from a previously reported 5.15 million. Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales.

The median house price increased 3.8 percent from one year ago to $255,400 in October.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",U.S. business spending slowing; housing market weak,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods were unexpectedly unchanged in October and shipments rebounded modestly, which could temper expectations of an acceleration in business spending on equipment early in the fourth quarter.
While other data on Wednesday showed home resales rising last month after six straight monthly declines, house purchases remained sharply down this year. Sluggish business spending on equipment together with a lackluster housing market could stoke fears that higher interest rates are hurting the economy.
There was also disappointing news on the labor market. The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose to more than a four-month high last week. 
""The economy may have seen its best day already for growth and prosperity back a couple of months ago in late summer,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG. ""Winter is coming for the economic outlook where business investment spending looks to be topping out, and companies have let a few workers go."" 
The Commerce Department said the flat reading in orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, followed a downwardly revised 0.5 percent drop in September. 
These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent in September. 
Last month, there were declines in orders for primary metals and machinery. That offset increases in orders for fabricated metal products, computers and electronic products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.2 percent last month. Core capital goods orders increased 6.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.3 percent in October after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent drop in the prior month.
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
They were previously reported to have slipped 0.1 percent in September. Business spending on equipment stalled in the third quarter and is faltering despite the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut. 
Some companies including Apple Inc (O:AAPL) used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale. Spending on equipment could also be undercut by declining oil prices. Brent crude has dropped about 28 percent since early October amid rising concerns about slowing global growth.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 1.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.22 million units last month. Sales, however, were 5.1 percent lower than in October 2017, the sharpest 12-month drop since July 2014.
The report came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a second straight monthly decline in single-family homebuilding in October.
FOCUS ON FED 
The raft of tepid economic data, a sharp stock market selloff and signs of slowing global growth likely will put the Federal Reserve under the spotlight. Officials at the U.S. central bank have recently started talking about headwinds to domestic growth. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates in December for the fourth time this year.
The dollar (DXY) was trading lower against a basket of currencies on Wednesday. U.S. Treasury prices fell, while stocks on Wall Street rebounded after a brutal two-day drop.
Lack of growth in core capital goods orders in October suggests that shipments of these goods could drop in November, posing a downside risk to GDP estimates for the fourth quarter.
Economists say the White House's ""America First"" policies, which have resulted in tit-for-tat tariffs with major trade partners as well as a trade war with China, are also weighing on business investment. 
""It appears that businesses are becoming more concerned about domestic growth and the negative impact on trade conflicts and future trade relationships, and may be more reluctant to up their investment,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
A third report on Wednesday from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 224,000 for the week ended Nov. 17, the highest level since the end of June.
Data for the prior week was revised to show 5,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists had forecast claims slipping to 215,000 in the latest week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,000 to 218,500 last week.
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. The four-week average of claims rose by 6,750 between the October and November survey weeks, suggesting some moderation in job growth this month. 
""The initial claims data signal some softening in the labor market in that period relative to the reference week for the October report,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 

Payrolls increased by 250,000 jobs in October, with the unemployment rate holding near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent.

(Reuters) - U.S. borrowers filed the fewest applications for home refinancing in almost 18 years last week even as mortgage rates drifted lower in step with U.S. bond yields, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on refinancing activity fell 5.0 percent to 783.7 in the week ended Nov. 16. This was the weakest reading since December 2000.
On the other hand, MBA's seasonally adjusted measure on loan applications to buy a home rose to 227.7, up 3.1 percent for its biggest weekly gain since the July 5 week. It fell to its lowest since February 2017 the week before.
Overall mortgage activity still edged lower by 0.1 percent from the week before to 316.4, which was the lowest since December 2014, MBA's total application index showed.
The latest figures were not adjusted for the U.S. Veterans Day holiday last week, MBA said.
The mixed readings came as most borrowing costs fell with lower Treasury yields as investors moved into bonds due to volatility in the stock market.
Worries about slowing global growth have roiled Wall Street this week.
“Treasury rates declined last week as equity markets continued to see large swings amidst investor concerns over global economic growth,"" Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
Interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages whose balances are $453,100 or less on average edged down to 5.16 percent from the prior week's 5.17 percent, which was the highest since April 2010. 
Other mortgage rates that the MBA tracks were unchanged to down 10 basis points last week.
Last week, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) declined by over 11 basis points. On Wednesday, they were up 1.5 basis points at 3.063 percent after hitting a seven-week low of 3.036 percent on Tuesday.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 08:52AM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders unchanged; shipments rise,"WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods were unexpectedly unchanged in October and shipments rebounded modestly, which could temper expectations of an acceleration in business spending on equipment early in the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the flat reading in orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, followed a downwardly revised 0.5 percent decline in September.
These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent in September. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.2 percent last month. Core capital goods orders increased 6.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.3 percent in October after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent drop in the prior month.
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They were previously reported to have slipped 0.1 percent in September. 
Business spending on equipment stalled in the third quarter, raising concerns about the durability of the economic expansion that is now in its ninth year and the second longest on record.
Business spending on equipment has faltered despite the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut. Some companies including Apple (O:AAPL) used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale. 
Spending on equipment could also be undercut by declining oil prices. Brent crude has dropped about 28 percent since early October amid rising concerns about slowing global growth. 
The Federal Reserve has noted the slowdown in business spending, saying in its policy statement earlier this month that ""business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.""
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, tumbled 4.4 percent in October. That was the biggest drop since July 2017 and reflected a 12.2 percent decline in demand for transportation equipment.
Durable goods orders edged down 0.1 percent in September.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 0.2 percent last month. Orders for defense aircraft plunged 59.3 percent and bookings for civilian aircraft dropped 21.4 percent. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received only 18 aircraft orders in October compared to 65 in September.

The U.S. Department of Labor said that the number of individuals applying for initial jobless benefits in the seven days ended November 17 increased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 224,000 from the previous week’s upwardly revised total of 221,000.
The four-week moving average was 218,500, an rise of 2,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended November 10 declined to 1.668 million from 1.670 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for a drop to 1.635 million. These claims reflect people who recently lost their jobs and are already receiving benefits.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 04:47AM ET</span>",Britain records bigger-than-expected budget deficit in October,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain recorded a much larger budget deficit than expected in October, according to the first borrowing figures since finance minister Philip Hammond promised an end to austerity was within sight. 
The deficit in October rose to 8.820 billion pounds from 7.235 billion pounds a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, marking the biggest October shortfall for three years.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 6.15 billion pounds.
While tax receipts continued to grow robustly, government spending increased compared with a year ago.
The ONS cited ""notable"" growth in expenditure on goods and services, as well as social benefits. Interest payments on government debt also increased.
Still, for the first seven months of the 2018/19 financial year, the deficit stood at 26.7 billion pounds, down almost 30 percent on the previous year and the lowest at this stage of the financial year in 13 years.
In his budget statement on Oct. 29, Hammond announced tax cuts for households and the easing of welfare curbs for poorer working families as well as a big increase in spending on the health services.
But he also warned that an end to the severe spending cuts endured by many government departments since 2010 would depend on Britain securing a Brexit deal with the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May last week agreed a draft withdrawal deal with Brussels. But it faces stiff resistance in her Conservative Party, meaning it could fail in parliament.
Hammond wants to steadily cut national debt as a share of GDP which he says is too high to easily support a big rise in public spending during a future recession.
Public debt, excluding public-owned banks and the Bank of England's stimulus program, stood at 1.5985 trillion pounds in October, or 75.0 percent of gross domestic product.

That was down from 79.0 percent in the same month of 2017 but still double its level before the financial crisis.

The city-state's headline consumer price index probably rose 0.8 percent in October from a year earlier, the poll of 10 economists showed, accelerating from September's 0.7 percent climb.
The pick-up was due to a ""gradual improvement in domestic demand"", said Charnon Boonnuch, an economist with Nomura.
The poll also showed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) core inflation measure also likely increased to 1.9 percent in October from a year earlier, compared to a 1.8 percent rise the previous month.
The central bank's core inflation measure excludes changes in the price of cars and accommodation, which are influenced more by government policies.
""The MAS Core Inflation is also expected to inch higher... and is on track to exceed 2 percent slightly toward year-end,"" ANZ said in a research note to clients. 
A higher core inflation measure would give the MAS a case to tighten monetary policy further, analysts said. 
""We still hold that the MAS will further tighten in 2019,"" said Nomura's Boonnuch. 
Singapore's central bank in October tightened monetary policy for the second time this year, saying the city-state's economy is likely to expand steadily barring a setback to global growth from trade frictions between the United States and China.

""This (higher core inflation in October) validates MAS' decision,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank.

The companies signed up for $8.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $8.4 billion a year earlier, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA) said.
The increase in volume was helped by an expanding U.S. economy and lower corporate taxes, which continued to support capital spending by businesses.
""October new business generation shows no apparent signs of slowing down, despite slight—and steady—increases in long-term interest rates and reports of tariff concerns,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
""With another round of interest rate hikes scheduled before year-end, we will be monitoring closely any changes in business conditions.""
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals were 76.5 percent in October, up from 75.7 percent in September.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for November was 58.5, down from the October index of 63.2.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 11:57AM ET</span>","U.S. housing starts rise, but underlying trend weak","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rose in October amid a rebound in multi-family housing projects, but construction of single-family homes fell for a second straight month, suggesting the housing market remained mired in weakness as mortgage rates march higher.
Other details of the report published by the Commerce Department on Tuesday were also soft. Building permits declined last month and homebuilding completions were the fewest in a year. Housing starts increased 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.228 million units last month. 
""Rising interest rates and rising home prices are creating affordability challenges that are causing buyers to take pause and re-assess their situation,"" said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta. 
Building permits fell 0.6 percent to a rate of 1.263 million units in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a 1.225 million-unit pace last month. 
The struggling housing market is in stark contrast with the broader economy, which has enjoyed two straight quarters of robust growth and an unemployment rate at a near 49-year low of 3.7 percent. Prolonged housing weakness, together with a relentless sell-off on the stock market could stoke fears over the durability of the economy's strength. 
In addition to rising borrowing costs, the housing market is also being squeezed by land and labor shortages, which have led to tight inventories and more expensive homes. Many workers are being priced out of the market as wage growth has lagged.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is hovering at a seven-year high of 4.94 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Wages rose 3.1 percent in October from a year ago, trailing house price inflation of about 5.5 percent. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower on Tuesday, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index hitting a three-week low following weak results and forecasts from retailers including  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Kohl's Corp, and home improvement chain Lowe's Cos.
The dollar rebounded from two-week lows against a basket of currencies, while longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell.
Residential investment contracted in the first nine months of the year and housing is likely to remain a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter. Economists expect housing activity to remain weak through the first half of 2019.
SINGLE-FAMILY HOME BUILDING FALLS
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 1.8 percent to a rate of 865,000 units in October after declining in September.
Single-family homebuilding has lost momentum since hitting a pace of 948,000 units last November, which was the strongest in more than 10 years.
A survey on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dropped to a more than two-year low in November, with builders reporting that ""customers are taking a pause due to concerns over rising interest rates and home prices.""
Single-family starts in the South, which accounts for the bulk of homebuilding, fell 4.0 percent last month. Single-family homebuilding jumped 14.8 percent in the Northeast and fell 2.0 percent in the West. Groundbreaking activity on single-family homes dropped 1.6 percent in the Midwest.
Permits to build single-family homes fell 0.6 percent in October to a pace of 849,000 units. These permits remain below the level of single-family starts, suggesting limited scope for a strong pickup in homebuilding.
The declining affordability is boosting the rental housing market. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment surged 10.3 percent to a rate of 363,000 units in October. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes fell 0.5 percent to a pace of 414,000 units.
""Many renters have opted to renew their existing leases because they feel they are priced out of the housing market,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We could see a bit more strength in apartment starts in coming months.""
Tuesday's data also suggested that housing supply is likely to remain tight in the near term. Homebuilding completions in October fell 3.3 percent to a rate of 1.111 million units, the lowest level since September 2017.
Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. 

The stock of housing under construction rose 0.5 percent to a more than 11-year high of 1.137 million units last month. But the multi-family homes segment made up just over half of housing inventory under construction last month.

While that matched the median estimate of economists, single-family home starts fell for a second month. Permits, an indication of future construction, fell 0.6 percent to a 1.26 million rate, also in line with projections.

The Confederation of British Industry said its monthly order book balance rose to +10 from -6 in October, the sharpest fall in two years.
November's reading was stronger than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
""It's encouraging to see an improvement in the manufacturing sector after October's stark survey, with order books and output growth on the up,"" Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's top central banker on Tuesday rapped the country's scandal ridden banks for their errant behavior, saying strong penalties were required to punish misdeeds, but cautioned over regulation risks crimping much-needed credit to the economy. 
In a dinner speech in Melbourne, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said banks should consider correcting their internal incentive system that focuses on sales and short-term objectives. 
Lowe's speech comes as Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA) CEO Matt Comyn testifies under oath for a second day at a powerful government-mandated inquiry that has exposed widespread financial sector misconduct since the start of this year.
""The vast bulk of the people who work for Australia’s financial institutions do want to do the right thing, and they do want to serve their customers as best they can,"" Lowe said in the speech titled ""trust and prosperity"".
""But, like everybody else, they respond to the incentives they face.""
Australian banks have been accused of predatory lending and poor financial advice as they amassed huge profits at the cost of customers' interest.
In response to the allegations, they have slowed mortgage lending, their biggest source of revenue. 
Lowe said banks need to take risks and manage them well.
""If they become afraid to lend simply because of the consequences of making a loan that goes bad, our economy will suffer. So a balance needs to be struck here,"" he said.
""Strong penalties can play an important role in incentivising good behavior, and this is an area we should be looking at. But we do need to get the balance right as there can be unintended consequences."" 
The banks have tightened lending standards in the face of pressure from regulators. That has exacerbated weakness in Australia's once-hot housing market. 
HOUSING DOWNTURN
Lowe sounded comfortable about the softening in the property sector though that comes after ""very large run-ups"" in Sydney and Melbourne, the two biggest markets. 
He also noted the downturn in home prices comes against the backdrop of a strong world economy, robust domestic activity, falling unemployment, record low interest rates and rapid population growth. 
""This is a reasonably favorable backdrop against which to be having an adjustment in the housing market.""
""But we do need to watch things closely,"" he said. 
Lowe also touched upon stagnant real wage growth since 2012 that has hurt living standards even as Australia's A$1.8 trillion economy has outperformed its global peers by extending its recession-free run for 27 straight years.
Weak wage growth has been the single biggest factor restraining the RBA from raising borrowing costs. It has left its policy rate at a record low 1.50 percent since last easing in August 2016. 
Lowe expects a pick-up in household incomes as the labor market continues to tighten, though the gains are expected to be gradual. 
The RBA has become more optimistic about the economy but minutes of its Nov.6 policy meeting released earlier in the day revealed policymakers were in no hurry to jack up rates just yet.

In his speech, Lowe repeated that there was no strong case for a near-term change in rates as it awaits a pick up in inflation, although the next move will likely be up, than down.

Imports in October likely increased 6.8 percent from a year earlier, after rising 9.9 percent in September, according to the median forecast of 13 analysts in the poll.
Thailand likely recorded a deficit of $190 million in October, the poll showed, compared with September's surplus of $490 million.
The commerce ministry said last month it still expected exports - a key driver of growth - to increase 8 percent this year, after rising 9.9 percent last year.

Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) November policy meeting on Tuesday showed policy makers expect above-trend growth this year and next, helped by interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent. 
Earlier in November, the RBA predicted the unemployment rate would further ease to 4.75 percent by June 2020 from a 6-1/2 year trough of 5 percent now and 5.25 percent from an earlier estimate in August.
Indeed, members saw a chance of a more ""pronounced decline"" in the jobless rate in the near term given the strength of leading indicators.
Growth in the A$1.8 trillion economy is seen averaging around 3.5 percent this year and next, before slowing a tad to around 3 percent in 2020. Wages and inflation are also seen ticking higher, albeit gradually.
""The main source of the upward surprise had been business investment, owing to unexpected strength in both mining and non-mining investment,"" the minutes showed.
""In addition, the terms of trade had been higher than expected over the previous year and the Australian dollar had depreciated.""
IMF ONBOARD
The RBA is not alone in its optimism about the Australian economy, which is in its 27th year of recession-free growth.
In a report out on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it expected economic activity in Australia to stay robust in the near-term, helping cut labour market slack. 
The IMF also agreed with the RBA's assessment that it was still too soon to withdraw policy support given the unemployment rate still had further to fall. 
Despite strong jobs gains, household incomes had been growing at an unusually slow pace for some time, while recent falls in home prices in Sydney and Melbourne had added to the pressure on spending power.
Tuesday's minutes provided some colour into the RBA's thinking about the next move.
Members considered arguments from various commentators in favour of a future rate hike, which included stronger-than-expected economic momentum and financial stability risks from high household debt. 
Some had also argued that a higher cash rate would create room for future cuts. 
Meanwhile, the prime argument for a decrease was that even easier policy would lead to a faster pick-up in inflation. 
In the near-term though, the RBA's own assessment was that there was no ""strong case"" for a policy change, although the next move was still more likely to be up than down. 

""...members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy would continue to support economic growth and allow for further gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target,"" the minutes showed. 
Governor Philip Lowe singled out global trade tensions as a significant risk to world growth as the United States and China slap tariffs on each other's imports. 
Trade relations between the world two biggest economies seemed to worsen over the weekend when U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Brazil mid-November inflation slows below target's midpoint,"By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Lower fuel costs likely helped to bring Brazil's mid-November inflation rate back below the official target's midpoint, the latest Reuters poll shows, bolstering the view that a recent price spike was more a blip than a consistent upward trend.
That is likely to allow the central bank to take its time before raising interest rates from all-time lows, maintaining support for a still-fragile economic recovery.
Consumer prices tracked by the benchmark IPCA index probably rose 4.44 percent in the 12 months through mid-November, according to the median of 15 forecasts compiled by Reuters, down from a 4.56 percent end-October rate. 
The central bank targets a 4.5 percent year-end rate for 2018 and 4.25 percent for 2019, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.
Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) expect inflation to decelerate even more by year-end, pushed down by lower fuel and electricity costs. Still, food prices should remain high, in line with a trend seen throughout the year.
Food and energy prices are notoriously volatile categories that largely fall out of the central bank's control. When stripped of volatile items, so-called core inflation has hovered around 3.5 percent, suggesting the central bank has no reason to rush.
The IPCA index, scheduled for Friday at 9:00 a.m. local time (1100 GMT), likely rose 0.24 percent from the month before. 
Widespread unemployment amid an underwhelming economic recovery has kept a lid on price hikes. Meanwhile, the victory of far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro in the presidential election dispelled concerns over a potential currency selloff that could boost inflation.

The central bank last month kept the benchmark Selic rate at a record-low 6.50 percent and acknowledged reduced upward risks to inflation. In the minutes of that meeting, which took place just after the election, policymakers said inflation would likely peak in the second quarter of 2019 before easing towards its targets.

The NAHB and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) housing market index fell to 60 points in November, which was the lowest level since the 59 recorded in August 2016. That compared with a reading of 68 in October and a consensus reading of 67 among analysts polled by Reuters.
The index's eight-point drop was the biggest monthly decline since a 10-point decrease in February 2014.
The index's seasonally-adjusted component on current single-family home sales decreased to 67, the lowest since August 2016, from 74 in the prior month.
The seasonally-adjusted gauge on expectations of home sales in six months tumbled to 65 in November, matching the level last seen in May 2016. It was 75 in October.

The barometer on home builders' view on prospective buyers declined to 45, the lowest level since July 2016 and below 53 in October.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Home prices could fall in some smaller Chinese cities in 2019: Fitch,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Home prices in some smaller Chinese cities could fall next year as the world's second-largest economy slows, Fitch Ratings said on Monday, while adding the government is expected to step in to stem any precipitous decline. 
Nationwide growth in China's property prices has moderated this year in response to measures to curb speculation. But many investors are still exploiting regulatory loopholes, turning to smaller and less restrictive cities. 
A broad slowdown in the economy, however, is threatening to further chill the sector, which is a significant growth driver. Property sales by floor area have been declining month-on-month, though they are still higher this year on the whole compared with 2017.
Homebuilders are likely to face more difficult market conditions in 2019, with slowing economic growth and deteriorating sentiment likely to drag down sales volumes and stifle home-price gains, Fitch said in a statement, after cutting its outlook on the sector to negative from stable.
Property developers, in a bid to spur sales, have tried to manipulate prices, deliberately postponing sales to prop up prices, illegally providing loans for downpayment or even publishing false price information, according to the government.
But the rating agency said the downturn is likely to be muted, and the government has considerable scope to ease policies to support the market if required. 
Sales volumes may fall up to 10 percent, following low-single-digit gains in 2018, with declines likely to be the strongest in lower-tier cities, it said. 
Smaller cities will be most affected by the scaling back of monetized resettlement of shanty-town residents, Fitch said. 
Lower-tier cities have been broadly driving price gains in the overall market this year, partly due to China's long-term campaign to modernize housing developments.
BOOST FROM REDEVELOPMENT 
Shanty-town redevelopment has boosted property demand as residents use cash compensation to buy a new home when existing ones are demolished.
Not all analysts are as pessimistic as Fitch about 2019. 
Sales volume is headed for a decline next year, although the downturn should be ""shallower"" and ""shorter"" than previous ones, said Rosealea Yao, a Beijing-based property analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. 
For 2018, the market could expand 2 percent to a record 1.7 billion square meters, in a fourth straight year of gains, Yao wrote in a note on Monday. 
China's home prices have risen 42 consecutive months, according to data for 70 major cities tracked by the country's statistics bureau. 
Prices for the rest of China's 600-plus cities are not regularly published by the bureau. 
""Home prices are likely to remain largely stable, but could fall in some lower-tier cities. This would represent a significant softening from the 12 percent year-on-year rise in average nationwide prices in January-September 2018,"" Fitch said. 
""That said, prices will be closely managed by the government, which suggests any price moves will be modest.""
The pent-up demand created by tight restrictions in higher-tier cities will limit sales declines in those areas, Fitch said. 
Gavekal's Yao said that by region, the east, central and southwest provinces have solid population growth and economies, so sales have been more sustainable. 

The northeast is ""particularly troubled"", she said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore is expected to report slower third-quarter economic growth than initially thought, a Reuters poll showed, as the manufacturing sector faces strains from weaker global demand and an intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China. 
The government's finalised gross domestic product (GDP) was forecast to rise 4.2 percent in July-September from the quarter earlier on a seasonally adjusted and annualized basis, the poll of 11 economists showed, below the 4.7 percent rise seen in the advanced estimate but still much stronger that the 1.2 percent growth clocked in the second quarter.
""Final third quarter GDP is expected to be revised downwards, given the slower than expected manufacturing numbers and monthly indicators for the services sectors such as bank loans and property sales showing weaker numbers,"" said Maybank Kim Eng Securities economist Lee Ju Ye. 
On a year-on-year basis, third quarter GDP growth was forecast at 2.4 percent, slightly below the 2.6 percent advanced estimates and lower than the second quarter's 4.1 percent rise. It also marked the third successive quarter of softer annual growth.
While the city-state's economy grew strongly in 2018 and continued to motor at a reasonable pace through the first half of the year, stresses have started to emerge in recent months.
Singapore's central bank has warned that a heated trade war between the United States and China - one of the city state's major trade partner - could hurt the domestic economy. 
Export growth to China has slowed for 5 months in a row, raising worries about the outlook as the Sino-U.S. trade tensions showed no signs of abating.
""We see more slowing throughout 2019,"" Steve Cochrane, Moody's Chief Asia Pacific economist said, adding that the softening reflects cooling global growth. 
The Ministry of Trade and Industry had forecast full-year growth of 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 2018. Manufacturing and exports of electronics were one of Singapore's main drivers of growth last year, which saw GDP grow at its fastest pace in three years.
But year-on-year exports of electronics has been contracting this year while factory production unexpectedly declined in September. 

""There's been a shift in the pattern of exports this year. It used to be focused on electronics but now it has shifted to the non-electronics sector like pharmaceuticals,"" Cochrane said.

Export orders last month were expected to have risen 4.4 percent from a year earlier, according to the median of forecasts from 14 analysts in the poll. September saw a 4.2 percent annual increase. 
Growth forecasts ranged between 2.50 percent and 8.4 percent.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 09:32PM ET</span>","Japan's exports rebound in October, driven by U.S. car imports","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rebounded in the year to October, reversing from the prior month's surprise drop as U.S.-bound car shipments grew, although slowing global demand and the intensifying U.S.-China trade war cloud the outlook for export-reliant Japan.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Monday showed exports rose 8.2 percent in October from a year before, slightly below a 9.0 percent gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
The export growth followed a revised 1.3 percent annual drop in September, which analysts say was caused by natural disasters that forced a closure of an international airport and crimped factory output, distribution of goods and inbound tourism.
Monday's trade news followed gross domestic product data issued last week that showed Japan's economy, the world's third largest, shrank more than expected in the third quarter, hit by the natural disasters and sluggish exports.
While the economy is expected to return to growth this quarter as temporary effects from natural disasters fade, Japanese policymakers remain wary about the overall economic impact of global trade friction and slowing external demand.
""Japan's exports rebounded from a decline caused by natural disasters, but they are losing momentum compared with last year due to sluggish shipments to Asia caused by China's slowdown,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""The U.S.-China trade war has not yet had much impact on Japan's exports, but it warrants attention given that it could cause full-blown effects from next year onwards,"" he added.
Monday's trade data showed exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 9.0 percent in the year to October led by cars, car engines and plastic raw materials, following the prior month's drop.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, rose 7.3 percent.
U.S. TRADE DEFICIT
Japan's exports to the United States grew 11.6 percent in the year to October, led by shipments of cars. U.S.-bound auto exports stood at 154,085 cars, up 3.0 percent year-on-year, rising for the first time in five months.
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Japan as well as China over trade, asserting that Tokyo treats the United States unfairly by shipping millions of cars to North America while blocking imports of U.S. autos and farm products.
In September, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump agreed to start trade talks in an arrangement that appeared, at least for now, to protect Japanese automakers from further tariffs on their exports, which make up about two-thirds of Japan's $69 billion annual trade surplus with the United States.
Imports from the United States rose 34.3 percent in October, led by feed corn, liquefied petroleum gas and crude oil, helping reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States by 11.0 percent versus the same month last year to 573.4 billion yen ($5.09 billion).
Overall imports rose 19.9 percent in the year to October reflecting a spike in crude oil prices as well as effects of natural disasters.
The rise in imports exceeded the median estimate for a 14.5 percent annual increase, resulting in a trade deficit of 449.3 billion yen.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing production increases; headwinds growing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output rose for a fifth straight month in October, shrugging off a sharp drop in motor vehicle production and suggesting underlying strength in factory activity despite growing headwinds that are expected to slow the sector in 2019.
The Federal Reserve said on Friday manufacturing production rose 0.3 percent last month. Data for September was revised up to show output at factories increasing 0.3 percent instead of advancing 0.2 percent as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output rising 0.2 percent in October. Manufacturing, which accounts for more than 12 percent of the economy, is expected to slow down next year in part as the stimulus from the Trump's administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades.
Manufacturing surveys have suggested a moderation in factory activity amid labor shortages as well as more expensive raw materials caused by the White House's protectionist trade policy. 
A strong dollar, which has gained about 8.1 percent this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners, is also hurting exports, and there are signs of slowing growth in other economies, including China.
""The manufacturing sector is still coping fairly well with the dollar's recent appreciation and the slowdown in global growth,"" said Andrew Hunter, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. 
""But the recent weakening in the global manufacturing PMIs, particularly in China, suggests that the current strength of the factory sector is unlikely to be sustained,"" Hunter said, referring to purchasing managers' indexes.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with traders focused on worries about a slowing global economy. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
AUTO PRODUCTION SLUMPS
Motor vehicle production slumped 2.8 percent in October after rising 1.3 percent in September. Economists blamed the drop on U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, and warned of further harm to production if the duties were not scrapped.
""While automakers have successfully countered industry headwinds, such as tighter bank lending for autos, U.S. import tariffs on steel and aluminum continue to pose downside risks amid late-cycle demand fatigue,"" said Stephen Ciccarella, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing gained a solid 0.5 percent last month, boosted by a strong increase in the output of business equipment. That followed a 0.2 percent rise in September.
Business equipment production increased 0.8 percent, matching September's rise. The strong gains suggest a pickup in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter after it stalled in the July-September period.
October's rise in manufacturing production offset decreases in mining and utilities output, leading to a 0.1 percent gain in industrial production last month. Industrial output rose 0.2 percent in September.
The Fed said Hurricanes Florence and Michael had lowered the level of industrial production in both September and October, but the effects of the storms ""appear to be less than 0.1 percent per month.""
Mining output fell 0.3 percent in October after slipping 0.1 percent in September. Oil and gas well drilling rebounded 1.6 percent after declining for three straight months. With oil prices dropping to an eight-month low on Tuesday, economists expect mining production to remain weak.
""Given the steep declines in oil prices since early October, these declines in mining activity are likely to gather momentum in the coming months,"" said Jonathan Millar, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
Utilities output dropped 0.5 percent in October after dipping 0.1 percent in the prior month.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose to 76.2 percent in October, the highest since July 2015, from 76.1 percent in September. 
Overall capacity use for the industrial sector fell to 78.4 percent from 78.5 in September. It is 1.4 percentage points below its 1972-to-2017 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 12:33PM ET</span>",Student delinquencies up as U.S. household debt hits another record,"By Jonathan Spicer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The total debt shouldered by Americans has hit another record high, rising to $13.5 trillion in the last quarter, while an unusual jump in student-loan delinquencies could provide another signal that the U.S. economic expansion is growing old.
Flows of student debt into serious delinquency - of 90 or more days - rose to 9.1 percent in the third quarter from 8.6 percent in the previous quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported on Friday. That propelled the biggest jump in the overall U.S. delinquency rate in seven years. 
It was a reversal after a period of improvement for student debt, which totaled $1.4 trillion. Serious-delinquency flows have been growing on auto debt since 2012 and on credit card debt since last year, raising red flags for some economists.
The world's largest economy has grown well above its potential this year on the back of strong consumer spending and the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s. If growth continues for another year it will be the longest U.S. expansion ever. 
Total household debt, driven by a $9.1 trillion in mortgages, is now $837 billion higher than its previous peak in 2008, just as the last recession took hold and brought on massive deleveraging across the United States. Indebtedness has risen steadily for more than four years and sits more than 21 percent above a trough in 2013.
The $219 billion rise in total debt in the quarter ended September 30 was the biggest jump since 2016. 
While borrowers are far more creditworthy and lenders are more stringent than in the run-up to the last downturn, the upward creep in serious delinquencies in automobile, credit card and now student debt could unsettle policymakers at the Fed and elsewhere. 
Some 4.7 percent of outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency in the third quarter, up from 4.5 percent previously. This was ""primarily due to a large increase in the flow into delinquency for student loan balances,"" the New York Fed said in its report.
If the jump in student delinquencies persists, it could raise questions about the ability of income-based repayment programs to ease debt burdens on lower-income borrowers. Unlike auto and credit card lenders, student lenders have not loosened standards in recent years. 
Separate data from the New York Fed showed that borrowers aged 30 to 39 years and those 50 and older drove the jump in flows to serious delinquencies, a measure economists use to gauge market stress and likelihood of defaults.

Mortgage delinquency transitions worsened slightly. With the central bank having settled into a gradual rate-hike cycle, mortgage originations grew to $445 billion, from $437 billion in the previous quarter, suggesting borrowers are locking in lower costs while they can.

The core inflation measure which excludes energy and food was revised down.
Eurostat said that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.2 percent year-on-year in October after a 2.1 percent increase in September and a 2.0 percent gain in August. It was the biggest increase since December 2012.
The headline figure supports the European Central Bank's decision to end its price-boosting bond-buying program at year-end, as inflation is now overshooting the ECB target of price growth below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.
In less positive news for the ECB, inflation excluding the volatile components of energy and unprocessed food -- the core indicator that the central bank watches in its policy decisions -- was revised down by Eurostat to 1.2 percent on the year, from a previous estimate of 1.3 percent. It was however still growing faster than the 1.1 percent increase posted in September.
On the month, headline inflation went up by 0.2 percent in October, in line with market expectations, but slowing from 0.5 percent in September.
The narrower core indicator, watched by many market participants, which excludes energy, food, tobacco and alcohol, was confirmed at 1.1 percent on the year.
The rise in headline inflation was mostly driven by energy prices which jumped 10.7 percent year-on-year in October, while prices for other industrial goods went up by only 0.4 percent.

Inflation in the services sector, the largest in the euro zone economy, was 1.5 percent on the year, but prices dropped by 0.3 percent on the month.

(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QMf43B) 
The median estimate from a poll of 12 economists saw seasonally-adjusted growth of 0.6 percent in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Respondents' estimates ranged from 0.2 percent to 1.1 percent.
Gross domestic product grew 1.0 percent in the June quarter, slowing from the first quarter's 2.1 percent, which was the fastest pace in five years.
The poll's median forecast saw annual growth at 4.2 percent in the September quarter, below the June quarter's 4.6 percent.
The central bank has forecast slower growth in July-September and said it might lower its 2018 export growth forecast following September's unexpected decline in shipments.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, which is heavily reliant on external demand, has seen a pick-up in growth, although exports have slowed and tourism took a hit after a boat accident in July killed 47 Chinese visitors.
Thailand's exports to China, its second-biggest market, slumped 14 percent in September on-year, and are likely to remain weak in the wake of the intensifying Sino-U.S. trade war.
Tim Leelahaphan, an economist of  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), said while growth likely slowed, it would remain robust and in line with Thailand's potential growth rate of around 4 percent.
Political campaign spending leading up to a general election, which needs to be held by May, should give a ""short-term boost to growth"" through campaign-related activity and rural spending, he said.
The median forecast in the poll for full-year growth in 2018 was 4.5 percent and was 4.2 percent for 2019. Last year's growth was 3.9 percent, the fastest expansion in five years.
In July-September, Thailand's year-on-year exports growth slowed to 2.6 percent from the June quarter's 12.3 percent. Manufacturing also moderated.
Growth in third quarter foreign tourist arrivals slowed sharply to 1.9 percent on-year, with Chinese visitors down 9 percent.
But annual growth in private consumption accelerated to 6.5 percent the third quarter, with domestic car sales surging.
Private investment rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier, while government expenditure increased 2.3 percent.
The National Economic and Social Development Board, which compiles GDP data, forecast GDP to grow 4.2-4.7 percent this year, with exports up 10 percent. It will publish new projections on Monday.

The central bank on Wednesday left its policy interest rate  unchanged at 1.50 percent. But it noted a reduced need for accommodative policy, reinforcing the view that it might next month hike the rate for the first time in more than seven years.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 10:15PM ET</span>",India house prices to rise at half the rate of inflation in 2019: Reuters poll,"By Vivek Mishra and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - India house prices will rise at half the rate of consumer price inflation next year, hit by dwindling credit supply, according to a Reuters poll of housing market experts who said Delhi, the national capital, will be hit hardest.
House prices have risen at almost double-digit rates for over a decade in a country of 1.3 billion people, where for many, owning a home is still a dream. Major cities in India have become some of the most densely populated in the world.
Asia's third-largest economy is also grappling with a liquidity crunch after a large lending firm, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), defaulted on a short-term debt payment in June.
The Reserve Bank of India and the government have since tussled over tight liquidity. The government has blamed the central bank and has asked it to ease lending regulations for banks and financial firms.
Rising bad debts and non-performing assets have made major banks and other large financial institutions cautious on lending, leading to a slowdown in the property market, which relies heavily on borrowing for both home building and buying.
""The liquidity crunch is likely to continue in 2019 and push (house) price growth to an all-time low. It will also lead to a scarcity in funds, pushing home loan interest rates higher,"" said Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK property consultants.
""And thus, NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) and other commercial banks will be alert over further loan disbursements until normalcy returns to the market. This has created a deep-rooted problem. Only the fittest can survive,"" he said.
Puri also added the lack of credit ""will be worse"" for the housing market and smaller real-estate firms than the impact from the high-value currency ban two years ago and the hasty implementation of a goods and services tax last year.
House prices rose at an average annual rate of 8.5 percent last year, according to Reuters calculations based on the RBI's NHB Residex (National Housing Bank Residential index) measure.
The Reuters poll of 14 property market experts, conducted Oct. 29-Nov. 14, showed they expected national house prices to rise 2.8 percent this year and 2.0 percent next, around half the rate of the current and expected rate of consumer price inflation.
While the consensus is based on different measures, a majority in the poll provided their forecasts based on NHB Residex. The common theme across forecasts irrespective of the methodology clearly shows a sluggish pace of house price growth over the next year.
If the prediction for house price growth for this year is realized, it will be the lowest in at least a decade and likely the first time since the financial crisis house price growth in India has not outpaced inflation.
A regional breakdown shows a much worse picture for Delhi.
House prices in Delhi, including the National Capital Region, home to 20 million people, are forecast to fall 2.0 percent this year and 2.5 percent next. 
(https://tmsnrt.rs/2PiM0Ut)
""Frankly speaking, Delhi's real estate is highly overvalued; there are no fundamental (reasons) to prevailing prices and dynamics. Fifty-five percent of properties built in the last decade were in unattractive locations, which simply had no takers,"" said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director of realty consultancy Liases Foras.
""Apart from that, the increasing pollution really suggests doom for the market in Delhi. Water scarcity, pollution and floods are major factors which will impact prices and valuations over the coming years.""
Property prices in Mumbai, India's financial capital, were expected to stagnate this year and next. For Bengaluru and Chennai, the median forecast was for house prices to gain between 1 percent and a little over 2 percent in the next year.
High prices are deterring new buyers across most Indian cities, on top of rising interest rates and an economy that is now cooling.
When asked to rate the real estate market nationally, 11 of 14 analysts said it was ""overvalued"" relative to economic fundamentals.
Delhi and Mumbai were either ""overvalued"" or ""extremely overvalued"", according to a majority of respondents. But 10 of 13 analysts said homes in Bengaluru and Chennai were ""fairly priced"".

""Most markets, except Bengaluru, have seen a pronounced fall in demand due to lower affordability,"" said Arvind Nandan, executive director of research at Knight Frank India.

725,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Hong Kong's Economy Likely Slowed Last Quarter Amid Trade Gloom,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s economic growth is expected to have continued slowing last quarter, as the U.S.-China trade dispute and the deceleration on the mainland worsen the outlook for the trade-dependent economy.
Gross domestic product grew 3.3 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of data due at 4:30 p.m. Hong Kong time on Friday, a second straight quarterly deceleration. Retail sales growth was the lowest in September in more than a year, with a slump in luxury spending a sign of worsening sentiment from Chinese tourists.
The combination of domestic and international uncertainty points to a more modest outlook for the economy, after posting growth rates in excess of 3 percent for the past seven quarters.
While the government has kept its forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent growth this year so far, there will be a ""significant impact"" from the U.S.-China trade conflict on the economy next year, a senior official told lawmakers last month.
Citing the trade war,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc, United Overseas Bank Ltd, and ING Bank NV have downgraded their forecasts for Hong Kong’s full-year growth.
""Hong Kong is a small, open economy that is heavily reliant on the mainland economy. When the mainland isn’t doing very well, we won’t do well either,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist with ING in Hong Kong.
Consumption Weakens
Reduced consumption is the main factor determining the outlook for the third quarter, according to Pang. A high down payment ratio for property buyers means this takes more of their disposable income, leaving less for consumption of goods and services, she said.
Retail sales in September slowed the most since June 2017, and spending on watches, jewellery and clocks was the lowest since November last year.
Retail sales doesn’t include services, which make up more than half of consumption expenditure.
Cooling Property Market
The property market has shown signs of a downturn since September, when existing home prices started ticking down, mortgage applications plummeted, and luxury home transactions dropped to the lowest in data back to 2005.
That decline could lead to reduced demand for real-estate services and layoffs in related jobs but the effect was more likely to be seen in the current quarter, according to Pang, who is forecasting growth to slow again to 2.8 percent in the current three-month period.
The trade dispute between China and the U.S. is bound to damage Hong Kong’s economy, as those nations are its top two trading partners and it’s a key connector for business between the two.
September export growth slowed to 4.5 percent from double-digit growth in the previous two months and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council halved its forecast for full-year export growth to 3 percent after its export sentiment index plunged.
""The impacts on Hong Kong’s exports and business sentiment have already begun to surface, and could turn more apparent in the period ahead,"" a spokesman at the office of the government economist wrote in an emailed statement. ""If the trade conflicts are to escalate further, Hong Kong would face a less favorable economic environment.""

726,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 01:06PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales rebound, but consumer spending slowing","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in October as purchases of motor vehicles and building materials surged, but data for the prior two months was revised lower and the underlying trend suggested that consumer spending was probably slowing down. 
Still, the report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed broad gains in sales ahead of the holiday shopping season, which bodes well for consumer spending and the overall economy as the fourth quarter gets under way. 
""This morning's release confirms our expectations of a strong holiday season,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But, as the calendar flips to 2019, we expect a further moderation in spending, as the boost from tax cuts will start to fade for consumers.""
Retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month. Retail sales in September slipped 0.1 percent instead of rising 0.1 percent and sales in August were also weaker than previously thought.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0.5 percent in October. Sales rose 4.6 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3 percent last month. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Data for September was revised lower to show core retail sales rising 0.3 percent instead of gaining 0.5 percent as previously reported. Core retail sales fell 0.2 percent in August rather than being unchanged.
While that suggests some loss of momentum in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, consumption is being supported by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package. Declining oil prices are seen aiding retail sales in the months ahead. 
A robust labor market, marked by a 3.7 percent unemployment rate, is also underpinning spending. The lowest jobless rate in nearly 49 years is boosting wages, with annual wage growth recording its biggest increase in 9-1/2 years in October. 
Jobs market strength was underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a marginal increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week.
Strong domestic demand and a tightening labor market support views that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in December for the fourth time this year. The U.S. central bank last Thursday kept rates unchanged, but said data ""indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.""
""The backdrop of strong growth and subdued inflation should keep the Fed on track for continued gradual rate hikes through the first half of 2019,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies after Thursday's data, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.

The retail sales pace, if sustained, could keep the economy on a solid growth path even as business investment is slowing, the trade deficit is expected to deteriorate further and the housing market continues to weaken.
The economy's strength was highlighted by higher-than-expected quarterly sales from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) on Thursday. The world's largest retailer raised its full-year outlook. 
Though the Commerce Department said it could not isolate the impact of Hurricanes Florence and Michael on October's retail sales, the storms probably buoyed purchases of automobiles and building materials last month amid recovery efforts.
Auto sales jumped 1.1 percent last month after falling 0.1 percent in September. Sales at building material stores surged 1.0 percent in October. 
There were also increases in sales at clothing stores, online retailers and service stations last month. Americans also spent more on hobbies and at bookstores, while cutting back on furniture purchases. 
But spending at restaurants and bars slipped 0.2 percent, likely hurt by Michael, which soaked the Florida Panhandle in mid-October. Sales at restaurants and bars dropped 1.5 percent in September.
Other data on Thursday offered a mixed picture of the manufacturing sector in early November. The New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index rose to a reading of 23.3 this month from 21.1 in October.
A slight moderation in the new orders index was offset by strong increases in labor market measures. 
Separately, a survey from the Philadelphia Fed showed a slowing in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month, with its current general activity index tumbling to a reading of 12.9 from 22.2 in October amid a sharp slowdown in new orders.
Firms, however, remained upbeat about business conditions over the next six months. There was also a strong improvement in capital expenditure plans.

""The real risk to the outlook for manufacturers remains global trade risks,"" said Adam Ozimek, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""If this can be avoided, demand should remain strong for manufacturers.""

The Commerce Department said on Thursday business inventories rose 0.3 percent after increasing 0.5 percent in August. September's increase in inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product, was in line with economists' expectations.
Retail inventories edged up 0.1 percent in September as reported in an advance estimate published last month. Retail inventories increased 0.6 percent in August.
Motor vehicle inventories advanced 0.4 percent in September rather than the 0.3 percent rise reported last month. Auto inventories surged 1.8 percent in August.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, slipped 0.1 percent in September as estimated last month. They dipped 0.1 percent in August. Wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent in September and stocks at manufacturers gained 0.5 percent.
Inventories rebounded in the third quarter after being depleted in the April-June period. Inventories added 2.07 percentage points to the third quarter's 3.5 percent annualized growth rate.
Given strong domestic demand, businesses are likely to continue boosting stocks of goods, which should underpin production at factories and support economic growth in the fourth quarter.
Business sales increased 0.4 percent in September after climbing 0.5 percent in August. Sales at retailers rebounded 0.2 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August.
At September's sales pace, it would take 1.34 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from August.

Retail sales volumes in October alone dropped by 0.5 percent from September, in contrast to average forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists for them to rise by 0.2 percent. 
Year-on-year growth slowed to 2.2 percent from an upwardly revised 3.3 percent in September, the slowest since April and weaker than economists' forecasts for it to hold at September's original 3.0 percent reading.
""Retail sales slowed after a buoyant summer with the mild autumn hitting winter clothes sales,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said, adding that household goods sales also fell after strong growth in the two previous months.
Looking at the three months to October as a whole, which smooths out some monthly volatility, sales growth slowed to 0.4 percent from 1.2 percent, also the weakest growth since April.
Britain's economy has slowed since June 2016's Brexit vote but enjoyed a solid summer, with household spending growing by 0.5 percent in the three months to September.
Less than five months before Britain is due to leave the European Union, there have been signs this week of some respite for households, with underlying pay growth picking up to its fastest since 2008 at 3.2 percent and inflation holding at an 18-month low of 2.4 percent.
But October data from the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard showed households were continuing to shop cautiously after reining in spending in September, and that some shoppers were delaying purchases ahead of anticipated Black Friday discounts in November.
Thursday's ONS data showed the sharpest monthly fall in purchases of household goods, such as electronics and home appliances, since December 2017.
Year-on-year growth in fuel sales was the weakest since March 2017.
Many British retailers have reported difficult trading conditions.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 12:05AM ET</span>",China's home prices gather pace but speed bumps seen ahead,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices picked up slightly in October, led by sustained gains in smaller cities and suggesting a key driver of economic growth remained resilient, although investor caution points to moderation heading into 2019.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 1.0 percent in October from a month earlier, a touch higher than the previous month's reading of 0.9 percent, according to Reuters calculations based on an official survey on Thursday.
While the sector's solid growth could cushion the impact of a government crackdown on debt and escalating U.S. trade tensions, analysts warn of challenges in coming quarters as property investment further slows and sales contract.
The prices gains were mostly driven by China's 35 smaller cities, which posted an average price increase of 1.1 percent in October, accelerating from 0.9 percent in the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement accompanying the data.
(Cooling China's property market: http://tmsnrt.rs/2BSc9Bx) 
China's long-term campaign to modernize housing developments across the country has also sustained the property market. Analysts say the so-called shanty-town redevelopment project has boosted property demand as residents use any cash compensation to buy a new home when their existing one is demolished.
""The difference in price gains is very pronounced, with transactions in central and western China supporting the growth,"" said Zhang Dawei, analyst at Hong Kong-based real estate research consultancy Centaline.
""With inventories in those regions depleted, investment demand still high, and the shanty-town redevelopment program ongoing, price gains there have risen above the national average.""
China has injected billions of yuan into its shanty-town redevelopment program through the central bank's so-called Pledged Supplementary Lending (PSL) facility. The funds are largely used as cash compensation to residents whose old homes are being demolished. 
In October, price gains in provincial capitals Guiyang, Shijiazhuang and Wuhan were the biggest among the 70 cities surveyed by NBS.
China's 31 tier-2 cities - which include provincial capitals - saw an average price increase of 1.0 percent in October from a month earlier, slowing from the previous month even though more tier-2 cities posted gains than in September. 
China's four biggest cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou posted no change in their prices. 
The data confirmed the 42nd straight month of price increases, Reuters calculations showed, defying tougher curbs designed to rein in a near-three year real estate boom that has spilled over from megacities to the hinterland.
In a sign strength remains broad-based, 65 out of the 70 cities surveyed by NBS reported a monthly price increase for new homes, compared with 64 in September.
Compared with a year earlier, new home prices rose 8.6 percent, the fastest pace since July last year and quickening from September's 7.9 percent gain.
China's property market has been relatively resilient, despite tighter property curbs, as many investors exploited regulatory loopholes and turned to smaller and less-restricted cities.
COOLING SIGNS
A slowdown in broader economic momentum, however, is feeding through to parts of the property sector, a key driver of gross domestic product. In the third quarter, China's economy expanded at its weakest pace since the global financial crisis.
Growth in China's real estate investment in October slowed to a 10-month low and home sales fell again, as developers held back expansion plans in the face of softening economic conditions.
""Despite stable property price inflation in October, we expect the property sector to cool significantly in 2019,"" said economists at Nomura in a note.
""Tightening measures in large cities will not be reversed quickly unless there are signs of a sharp decline and support from PSL to lower-tier cities cannot continue indefinitely.""
Market sentiment has turned more cautious since the start of the second half of this year following a surge in failed land auctions. 
Transactions fell sharply over the period dubbed ""Golden September and Silver October"", traditionally a high season for new home sales.
Central bank data this week showed household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 563.6 billion yuan in October from 754.4 billion yuan in September. 

Some banks have recently lowered mortgage interest rates by 5 to 10 basis points for first-time property buyers, a likely spill-over effect from Beijing's recent moves to cut banks' reserve requirements to boost market liquidity, and mortgage loans have been issued at a faster pace nation-wide.

734,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>",Australian Employment Surges on Full-Time Jobs; Currency Climbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian employment surged in October, led by full-time jobs, as record-low interest rates helped spur hiring. The currency jumped.
The data suggest policy makers’ patience -- they have kept the cash rate at 1.5 percent for more than two years -- is being rewarded with stronger employment and faster economic growth. Governor Philip Lowe is betting on a tightening labor market to fuel wage growth and inflation and lay the ground for the first rate increase since 2010.
“The Reserve Bank would be very happy with today’s report,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed, who previously worked at the RBA. “It consolidated the gains from last month and strong growth in full-time roles points to a thriving jobs market.”
The Australian dollar rose to 72.77 U.S. cents at 12:25 p.m. in Sydney from 72.35 cents before the report. Traders are now pricing in a 40 percent chance of a rate hike in August next year, from 25 percent before the release.
The solid report comes a day after data showed wages rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter, the fastest annual pace in three years. However, economists noted that outcome was inflated by a 3.5 percent increase in the minimum wage. Inflation, meanwhile, is still bumping along below the bottom of the central bank’s 2 to 3 percent target.
“Much progress still needs to be made, which suggests that a rate hike in the near-term is unlikely, but it is still a step in the right direction,” Pickering said. “Wage growth, rather than employment, is the more pressing issue for the RBA.”
Australia’s economy expanded 3.4 percent in the second quarter, the fastest annual pace in six years, after growing 3.2 percent in the previous three months.

735,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 11:44AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer inflation rises; oil prices may slow momentum,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nine months in October amid gains in the cost of gasoline and rents, pointing to steadily rising inflation that likely will keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again next month.
Though overall inflation could slow in the months ahead following a recent slump in oil prices, economists said Fed officials were likely to regard any retreat as temporary and focus on underlying price pressures.
The U.S. central bank, which has a 2 percent inflation target, left interest rates unchanged last Thursday after a two-day policy meeting. In its policy statement, the Fed noted that annual inflation measures ""remain near 2 percent.""
""Fed officials are likely to look past the swings in energy prices that could slow the overall CPI in coming months to see further upward pressure on underlying prices,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""As such, we still expect the Fed to raise interest rates in December."" 
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month, the biggest gain since January, after edging up 0.1 percent in September. In the 12 months through October, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, picking up from September's 2.3 percent rise.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2 percent. The so-called core CPI had gained 0.1 percent for two straight months. In the 12 months through October, the core CPI increased 2.1 percent after advancing 2.2 percent in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 0.3 percent and the core CPI gaining 0.2 percent in October.
The dollar (DXY) was weaker against a basket of currencies after touching a 16-month high earlier this week while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street initially rose on the inflation data and a rebound in oil prices, which tumbled more than 7 percent on Tuesday, before moving lower.
Oil prices have lost more than a quarter of their value since early October amid a surge in supply and increasing concerns about an economic slowdown. The drag on inflation from oil prices is likely to be offset by a tightening labor market, which is spurring faster wage growth.
The unemployment rate is at nearly a 49-year low of 3.7 percent and annual wage growth recorded its largest increase in 9-1/2 years in October. 
""In the medium- to longer-run we believe this increase in wage growth will both push up business costs as well as support demand, leading to firming price inflation,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""In the shorter-run, however, the consumer price outlook will be challenged by the stronger dollar and weaker energy prices.""
CHEAPER FOOD
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 2.0 percent for five straight months. Economists believe the core PCE price index slipped just below 2.0 percent in October. The government will publish the PCE price index data at the end of the month.
""Core inflation that is close to but just below target will not prevent the Fed from raising rates in December,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""However, it strengthens the argument that aggressive hikes are unnecessary despite continued strong growth.""
Last month, gasoline prices rebounded 3.0 percent, accounting for more than one-third of the increase in the CPI, after slipping 0.2 percent in September. 
Food prices fell 0.1 percent after being unchanged in September. Food consumed at home declined for a second straight month in October, held down by cheaper bread, cereals, pork, dairy products, fruits and vegetables.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3 percent in October after advancing 0.2 percent in the prior month. 
Healthcare costs increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in September. Apparel prices edged up 0.1 percent after jumping 0.9 percent in September. 
There were also increases in the costs of household furnishings and used motor vehicles and trucks as well as motor vehicle insurance and tobacco.

But prices for new motor vehicles dropped 0.2 percent last month. Communications costs fell as did prices for recreation and personal care products.

The Labor Department said on Wednesday its consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% last month, picking up from the 0.1% increase seen in September.
The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts.
In the 12 months through October, inflation rose 2.5%, in line with expectations and up from 2.3% in September.
Core CPI, a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.2% from a month earlier, matching consensus. The annual increase in the core CPI was 2.1%. Economists had forecast an increase of 2.2%.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Recent solid U.S. economic reports and an upbeat assessment of the economy from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have triggered expectations for a faster-than-expected pace of rate hikes from the Fed.
Although the Fed left interest rates on hold last week, the central bank delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy and labor market, reaffirming expectations for a December rate hike. Policymakers are widely expected to raise interest rates at the end-of-the-year meeting for what would be the fourth time in 2018 and currently have plans for three further rate hikes in 2019.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy contracted for the first time since 2015 in the third quarter as global trade disputes and problems in the auto industry put the traditional growth engine of exports into reverse, raising concerns that a long expansion is faltering.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in Europe's biggest economy fell 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, the Federal Statistics Office said on Wednesday. That compared with a Reuters forecast of a 0.1 percent drop.
But the Economy Ministry said the upswing would resume in the fourth quarter, adding that the slowdown between July and September had been a temporary phenomenon as car companies struggled to adjust to new pollution standards known as WLTP.
""A 0.2 percent contraction isn't a catastrophe,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in Berlin.
Compared with the same quarter of the previous year, the economy grew 1.1 percent in the third quarter, calendar-adjusted data showed. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 1.3 percent.
""The slight decline in GDP compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to foreign trade developments: provisional calculations show there were fewer exports but more imports in the third quarter than in the second,"" the Office said.
Separately, Germany's BDI industry association cut its 2018 export growth forecast to 3 percent from 3.5 percent on Wednesday, the second cut in as many months. 
The third-quarter dip in GDP was the first time the economy has contracted since the first quarter of 2015.
The government had flagged a weaker third quarter last month, citing bottlenecks in the car sector stemming from the introduction of WLTP as a factor.
""Germany doesn't have an economic problem but rather an auto sector problem. Due to the sluggish certification of cars, car production had to be noticeably reduced, with collateral damage for other sectors too,"" said Andreas Scheuerle at DekaBank.
The Economy Ministry said problems adapting to the WLTP had probably shaved up to 0.4 percentage points off third quarter GDP.
""The upturn was merely disrupted during the third quarter,"" the ministry said in its monthly report, adding: ""Once these special effects have dissipated, the German economy's upturn will continue.""
However, the ZEW research institute said on Tuesday that investors do not expect the German economy to recover rapidly from the weak patch.
Concerns are growing in the German economy, which is in its ninth year of expansion, about the impact of global trade disputes and Britain's departure from the European Union.
In addition to anxiety about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's abrasive trade policy, German firms are concerned about instability at home where Chancellor Angela Merkel's awkward 'grand coalition' has come close to collapsing twice.
Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said that even though he expected the auto sector to rebound in the fourth quarter, the GDP figures period were a ""wake-up call that political stability and strong growth are by no means a given"".
""The poor export performance, despite a weak euro exchange rate, suggests that trade tensions and weaknesses in emerging markets could continue to weigh on Germany's growth performance,"" he said in a research note.

Last month, Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce cut its 2018 growth forecast to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent and predicted a slowdown to 1.7 percent next year as the economy faces growing risks at home and abroad.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China delivered a mixed economic report card for October on Wednesday as softening retail sales pointed to a consumption slowdown, even as a pick-up in industrial output and investment suggested support measures may be starting to take hold.
Taken together with weak credit data the previous day, the latest readings reinforced consensus views that the world's second-largest economy will continue to cool in the next few quarters.
Facing the weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis, Chinese policymakers are fast-tracking big road and rail projects, pushing banks to increase lending, and cutting taxes to ease strains on businesses. And more action is likely on the way.

""Policy measures, including funding support for private firms, need some time to show results. GDP growth in the fourth quarter could dip below 6.5 percent,"" said Wang Jun, Beijing-based chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
Manufacturing has been supported by resilient exports as firms rush to ship goods to the United States ahead of higher tariff rates, amid persistent trade tensions between the world's largest economies.
Investors are hoping for some progress that front when U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping meet later this month.
But the bigger worry for China lies at home, with domestic consumption starting to slow amid mounting household debt, while the real estate sector - a major driver - continues to cool.
Retail sales rose 8.6 percent in October from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said, the slowest since May. Analysts had expected only a marginal dip from 9.2 percent in September.
A slump in auto sales has put the world's biggest car market on the verge of its first annual contraction since at least 1990, while garment sales are growing at the weakest pace in over two years, pointing to faltering consumer confidence.
""There are myriad reasons for this step-down in consumer spending: the increase in mortgage debt is eating into disposable income, investment returns are falling, and the closure of many online lenders is cutting off a key source of consumer finance,"" Everbright Sun Hung Kai said in a note.
Beijing is hoping to offset the drag by cutting import tariffs and income tax - it is even reportedly considering making mortgage payments tax-exempt - but those policies may not have much impact, Everbright said.
E-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) reported a record 213.5 billion yuan ($30.70 billion) in sales on Sunday from China's Singles' Day - an annual 24-hour buying frenzy. But the pace of growth dropped to its slowest rate in the event's 10-year history.
Slower retail sales were due to seasonal factors, Liu Aihua, a spokeswoman at the statistics bureau, told reporters.
However, analysts noted sales growth has been on a downward trajectory since March.
""Almost all categories in retail sales disappointed in October. We think the government's fiscal stimulus came in too late, and people now tend to save more and spend less,"" Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING bank in Hong Kong.
""We expect the effect of the personal income tax cut will start to be felt in November, when retail sales may gain some traction.""
China in October raised the threshold for collecting individual income tax to 5,000 yuan per month from 3,500 yuan in the hopes of boosting consumption.
FACTORY GROWTH - FOR NOW
One of the few positive surprises was industrial output, which rose 5.9 percent. It had been expected to ease slightly from September's 5.8 percent.
But analysts warned the rebound may be short-lived, saying exports could fall sharply if the U.S. proceeds with a sharp hike in duties on Chinese goods from January. Surveys show factory export orders have been shrinking for months.
China watchers were also heartened by signs of improvement in overall investment growth, which hit a record low earlier this year as regulators reined in local government spending.
Fixed-asset investment growth quickened more than expected to 5.7 percent in January-October. Analysts had expected only a slight tick up to 5.5 percent.
Infrastructure spending, a major growth lever that Chinese policymakers have pulled in past slowdowns, also showed some signs of life. It picked up to 3.7 percent in the first 10 months of the year from 3.3 percent previously, suggesting the government's growth steps are starting to have an effect.
The state planner gave the greenlight to 45 projects worth 437.4 billion yuan ($63 billion) last quarter. In response, cement production jumped 13.1 percent in October.
Private sector fixed-asset investment also edged up, to 8.8 percent. It accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.
China has pledged to ramp up infrastructure investment further to spur demand. But even if projects get funding swiftly, economists note it will take some time before the new spending works its way through the economy and growth starts to stabilize.
COOLING REAL ESTATE
Possibly adding to consumer jitters, even China's vaunted property market is showing signs of fatigue, with growth in real estate investment cooling to a 10-month low and home sales falling again last month.
Property investment, which mainly focuses on residential but also includes commercial and office space, grew 7.7 percent in October on-year, slowing from 8.9 percent in September, Reuters calculations showed.

Property sales by floor area fell 3.1 percent, following a 3.6 percent decline in September, official data showed.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>","Japan's economy contracts in third quarter, trade war clouds rebound outlook","By Stanley White and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank more than expected in the third quarter, hit by natural disasters and a decline in exports, a worrying sign that trade protectionism is starting to take its toll on overseas demand.
The contraction in the world's third-largest economy adds to growing signs of weakness globally, with China and Europe losing momentum. Data released later in the day showed Germany's economy also contracted in the third quarter on weak foreign trade.
Despite the setback, Japan's government stuck to its view that the economy continues to recover moderately, blaming the contraction on typhoons and an earthquake that halted factories and stifled consumption.
But some analysts said such one-off factors alone could not explain the downturn, pointing to worrying declines in exports amid slowing Chinese demand and the fallout from escalating global trade friction.
""The decline in exports cannot be attributed entirely to the natural disasters,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""The message is China's economy is weakening, which means Japan's exports will be slow to recover and growth will stall around the first half of next year.""
The annualized 1.2 percent contraction in July-September was bigger than a median estimate for a 1.0 percent drop and followed a robust 3.0 percent expansion in the previous quarter, government data showed on Wednesday.
The slump was driven largely by a 1.8 percent fall in exports, the biggest drop in more than three years. Capital expenditure, which rose 3.1 percent in April-June, dropped 0.2 percent to mark the first decline in two years, the data showed.
Analysts do expect a rebound in the current quarter, but warn it could be tepid and growth could stall next year, when the strains from trade conflicts become more acute.
""Japan's economy may slow down from January onwards as the U.S.-China trade war intensifies,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""U.S. tariffs on its imports of Chinese goods take effect in January, curbing Chinese shipments, which will in turn damage Japanese exports and capital expenditure,"" he said.
POLICYMAKERS IN A BIND
Heightening overseas uncertainties add to headaches for Japanese policymakers, already worried by the expected blow to consumption from next year's scheduled sales tax hike.
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of GDP, fell 0.1 percent in July-September as consumers spent less on travel, lodgings, and dining out.
While the government is considering a stimulus package of around 10 trillion yen ($88 billion) to offset the tax hike impact, a darkening overseas outlook could strengthen politicians' calls for even bigger spending.
That puts policymakers in a bind. Many analysts see little room for the Bank of Japan to ramp up an already huge stimulus drive that is straining financial institutions.
Japan's ballooning debt pile, the biggest among advanced economies, also constrains the government's ability to deploy a big spending package.
""Monetary policy is stretched so it would be difficult to take additional easing steps. Fiscal measures are already being considered to offset a blow from the sales tax hike, so there's little room left on this front too,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But you cannot rule out the possibility of a bigger spending package, depending on the extent of economic slowdown.""
Japanese factories were quick to recover from the third quarter's natural disasters. The bigger concern among Japanese firms is the trade war between the United States and China, as it threatens Japan's exports of car parts, electronics and heavy machinery.
Government data published last month showed exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, fell in September for the first time in seven months.

""IT-related exports to Asia have been slowing from around spring, so we need to be mindful of the impact trade frictions and China's growth outlook could be having on Japan's economy,"" Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters after the GDP data came out.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 01:35AM ET</span>",Malaysia's third-quarter GDP growth seen rising slightly to 4.6 percent year-on-year: Reuters poll,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia likely had slightly faster economic growth in the third quarter, a Reuters poll showed, which would snap a three-quarter streak of slowing expansion even as external demand remains weak. 
The median forecast from 15 economists is for annual growth of 4.6 percent in July-September, a marginal rise from the previous quarter's 4.5 percent pace.
Individual forecasts for the quarter - the first full one with Mahathir Mohamad back as prime minister - ranged from 4.1 to 5.0 percent.
Malaysia's forecast for full-year growth this year is 4.8 percent. In 2017, the economy expanded 5.9 percent.
Standard Chartered said private consumption likely remained strong even after the introduction of a sales tax to replace a broader goods and services tax (GST) that Mahathir had promised, before his coalition's stunning election victory in May, to scrap.
The absence of GST in July and August ""may have boosted private spending"" in those months, the bank said in a Nov. 9 note.
However, overall GDP growth in the quarter for the trading nation was crimped by weak crude oil and natural gas production, it added. 
Third quarter growth would have been reined in by slower exports compared with the previous three months, contributing to softer domestic indicators, according to Euben Paracuelles, an economist with Nomura.
""The spillover into the rest of the economy in Malaysia tends to be fairly significant and quick because of the size of the export sector,"" he said.
Exports rose 6.7 percent in September from a year earlier, rebounding from a 0.3 percent annual drop a month earlier, according to government data.
However, the trade surplus for July-September of 25.2 billion ringgit ($6.01 billion) was 4.1 percent smaller than that of one year earlier. In April-June, the surplus was 27.2 billion ringgit, or a 12.9 percent annual rise.
Last week, Malaysia's central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at 3.25 percent. It raised its rate by 25 basis points in January, its first hike since July 2014.

On Nov. 2, Mahathir's administration presented a proposed 2019 budget that includes cuts in public spending and increased revenue from privatizing infrastructure assets and a one-off dividend of 30 billion ringgit ($7.16 billion) from state energy firm Petronas.

Industrial output jumped 5.9% in October, outperforming previous expectations of a 5.7% growth, the NBS said.
Meanwhile, Fixed-asset investment growth came in at 5.7% in the January-October period, again beating analysts’ estimates of a 5.5% growth.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.8% in January-October, compared with an increase of 8.7% in the first three quarters. Private investment accounts for about 60% of overall investment in China.
Retail sales, on the other hand, rose 8.6% year-on-year in October. Markets expected sales to rise by 9.1%.
Trade disputes with the U.S. continued to impact China’s economic outlook, analysts said.
Negotiations between the two nations have stalled after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered new tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year.
However, on Wednesday, top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told CNBC in an interview that communications between China and the U.S. are now at all levels of two governments, adding that he has spoken to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about it as part of their preparation for the upcoming G-20 summit.

745,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",China's October property investment growth hits 10-month low as economy slows,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's real estate investment in October cooled to a 10-month low and home sales fell again, as developers held back expansion plans in the face of broadly softening economic conditions. 
The property market - a key driver of economic growth - has been cooling in recent months, as land auctions tumbled and various tightening measures kept overall home sales in check.
Property investment, which mainly focuses on residential but also includes commercial and office space, grew 7.7 percent in October from a year earlier, slowing from an 8.9 percent expansion in September, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data out on Wednesday.
Analysts have warned that weakening momentum in the sector could heighten risks for the broader economy, which is slowing on the back of a heated trade row with the United States and a years-long campaign by authorities to clamp down on easy credit.
Third quarter growth in the world's second-biggest economy cooled to its weakest quarterly pace since the global financial crisis, and analysts expect a further slackening over the coming year. 
The property market has been relatively resilient in the face of a raft of curbs, as many investors exploited regulatory loopholes and turned to smaller and less-restricted cities.
Some speculators are also betting that local governments, which rely on revenue from real estate, will be reluctant to overly tighten the screws in the sector.
Property sales by floor area were down 3.1 percent in October from a year earlier, compared with a 3.6 percent fall in September. In year-to-date terms, property sales rose 2.2 percent in the first ten months, official data showed.
The weakness in the period, dubbed ""Golden September and Silver October"", traditionally a high season for new home sales, was mainly led by tepid transactions in bigger cities. 
Sentiment started to turn cautious after the second half of 2018 due to a surge in failed land auctions, especially in bigger cities, as developers struggled with thinning margins amid the prolonged curbs and softening economic conditions. 
Land transactions by area fell 22 percent in 40 major Chinese cities in October from the preceding month, while the land transaction premium rate was two percentage points lower than September, according to data from CRIC, a private research firm.
As economic headwinds rise, home buyers are staying on the sidelines.
New construction starts measured by floor area rose 14.7 percent in October from a year earlier, compared with a 20.3 percent gain in September, Reuters calculations showed.
China's real estate developers raised 13.56 trillion yuan ($1.95 trillion) in the first ten months, up 7.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, the NBS said. 
The growth rate compared with a 7.8 percent increase in January-September period. 
Official data for September showed smaller cities helped quicken China's new home price growth, with a modest lowering in bank mortgage rates providing a filip, though the backdrop of a weakening economy is expected to keep sales modest. 
Some banks have recently lowered mortgage interest rates by 5 to 10 basis points for first time property buyers, likely a spill-over effect from Beijing's recent moves to cut banks' reserve requirements to boost market liquidity, and mortgage loans have been issued at a faster pace nation-wide.

Central bank data this week showed household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 563.6 billion yuan in October from 754.4 billion yuan in September.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 02:05PM ET</span>","Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary face tough Brexit ride: ING","LONDON (Reuters) - The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary face being hit hard by Brexit, a new ING report estimates, as changes to key supply chains and a drop in expat worker remittances compound what could be a 20 percent cut in the countries' EU funding.
The Dutch bank's report, published on Tuesday, said the carmaking, agriculture and textiles industries would suffer the most from potential disruption arising from Britain's planned withdrawal from the European Union in March 2019.
Britain is Poland's second largest export market and Poland maintains a large trade surplus with the UK worth just over 8 billion euros ($9.02 billion) a year. 
Both Hungary and the Czech Republic meanwhile are exposed to British demand for vehicles, with 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent of the respective GDP linked to value added exports to the UK. 
The biggest threat, though, will be what Brexit could mean for the 2021-27 EU budget, discussions around which are already taking shape, the ING report indicated.
Currently, Britain contributes around 6 percent of the EU’s budget but its departure will also see average EU GDP per capita levels decline. 
That will mean Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary's GDP per capita levels are no longer below the average and the funding they receive will therefore most likely get cut. 
""This and fresh priorities will have profound implications for the 2021-27 budget round, potentially delivering 20 percent plus declines in real terms for the likes of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary,"" ING estimated.
Any extension in the Brexit transition period beyond 2020 would soften that figure somewhat, it acknowledged, but the money central European-born workers living in Britain send back to their homeland, known as remittances, is also likely to fall.
Britain plans tighter controls on immigration after Brexit.
Poland is the largest recipient of remittances with total inflows of 1 billion euros a year. Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria are all quite far behind at 0.3, 0.15, 0.14 and 0.07 billion respectively.
But there are nuances there too. Many Polish workers have been in Britain for more than 10 year, meaning they will not have to leave after Brexit.
""Romania may be more exposed from a decline in remittances than Poland, since the Polish presence in the UK workforce is more mature,"" ING said.
The report noted that some western EU states could also suffer from Brexit, with the Netherlands relying for 3.44 percent of its GDP on British demand, 1.5 times the EU average.
Ireland is also exposed, with its central bank forecasting that if Brexit were to leave British-Irish trade governed by World Trade Organisation rules for countries with no bilateral deals, Ireland's gross domestic product (GDP) would decline 2.9 percent lower in the long run.

Worker shortages have become an increasing concern for U.S. companies now that unemployment has fallen to 3.7 percent, and part of the problem has been a decline in the rate at which working-age people participate in the labor force. 
The San Francisco Fed paper, whose lead author is the bank's new president Mary Daly, analyzed Canada's track record of a rising participation rate, and found that most of the difference can be attributed to policies like childcare subsidies and parental leave policies that make it easier for Canadian women to remain in the workforce after they have children. 
""The contrast between the incentives Canada and the United States offer prime-age workers to remain attached to the labor force is clear,"" Daly and her co-authors wrote.

Fears about trade disputes, the risk of a disorderly Brexit and political uncertainty at home are weighing on Europe's largest economy, which is in its ninth year of growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy, which likely shrank in the third quarter, is set to grow more slowly in the coming year than previously thought, according to a Reuters poll of economists who cited the U.S.-China trade war as the biggest threat.
Nearly all economists, 33 of 36, said downside risks to Japan's economy have increased compared with three months ago, the Nov. 6-12 poll showed.
Asked to identify next year's biggest economic risk, 16 economists picked ""U.S.-China trade friction,"" 10 selected ""China's economic slowdown"" and eight said ""New Japan-U.S. trade negotiations"", the survey found. 
One pointed to fallout stemming from further interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Japan's place in the global supply chain makes it vulnerable to higher tariffs on U.S.-bound Chinese exports. Manufacturers in China use parts and equipment from Japan to make smartphones and computers, and Japanese factories in China also ship goods to the United States.
""Potentially the biggest risk from intensified U.S.-China trade tension is the indirect impact on corporate sentiment and capital expenditures,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities Japan.
Japan's economy is expected to shrink in the third quarter, according to a separate Reuters poll, hurt by a string of natural disasters and a slump in export demand.
But for the whole year through March 2019, they predict it will grow 1.0 percent, down from the 1.2 percent growth projected last month. 
Looking ahead to next year, the world's third-biggest economy will likely take a big hit in the fourth quarter -- shrinking at an annual pace of 3.2 percent -- when authorities plan to hike the sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent, the poll showed.
The tax hike will raise revenue for increased pension and social welfare costs as the country's population ages.
NO POLICY CHANGE ANY TIME SOON
The poll found core inflation, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, is set to rise 0.9 percent in the current fiscal year ending March 2019. 
It is forecast to rise at the same pace - excluding effects of the scheduled sales tax hike - next fiscal year too.
The Bank of Japan is expected to keep its pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and long-term rates around zero percent till the end of 2019, the poll found.
Nearly every respondent who answered an additional question said that the BOJ's next move would be to tighten policy, not loosen it, but a strong majority said that wouldn't likely happen until 2020 at the earliest. 
The two most common replies on what steps the central bank would eventually take to tighten policy were to raise the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target or expand the range it allows the yield to trade. 
CELL PHONE RATES
Signs that Japan's major mobile phone carriers plan to cut fees next year will depress the core consumer price index (CPI), economists predicted, possibly creating a headache for the central bank, which is trying to spur inflation.
But views were split on whether such cuts would boost overall consumer spending.
Japan's mobile carrier NTT Docomo Inc (T:9437) plans to cut mobile charges by up to 40 percent in the April-June quarter following government criticism that fees are left artificially high due to a lack of competition in the industry.
Other big carriers like KDDI Corp (T:9433) and SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) could follow suit.
Thirty-four of 37 economists believe cuts in mobile phone fees will push down the core CPI. Sixteen said that would boost consumption, while 18 said it would not.
""It could support consumer spending to some extent as people are conscious of the planned sales tax hike,"" said Takashi Shiono, economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities Japan. 
""But we don't think it will have an effect on consumer spending as people will be inclined to save money.""

Data last month from the INSEE national statistics office said the French economy had expanded by 0.4 percent in the third quarter - falling short of forecasts for 0.5 percent growth.
Economists have said the French economy would need to grow by about 0.8 percent in the last quarter to hit the 1.7 percent rate that President Emmanuel Macron's government is forecasting for the full year.

The Bank of France added in its business climate survey on Monday that industrial production in October had slowed down, mainly due to sluggishness in the automobile sector which has seen new industry regulations impact car production.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 10:49AM ET</span>","Energy, services fuel jump in U.S. producer prices","By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose more than expected in October and at their fastest pace in six years but measures of underlying price pressure cooled, bolstering the view that the U.S. central bank is not facing a resurgence in inflation.
Other data on Friday suggested U.S. consumers polled this month expected less inflation over the next year compared to their expectations a month earlier.
Prices paid by producers rose 0.6 percent in October, the biggest gain since September 2012, with much of the increase fueled by a jump in costs for energy and trade services, according to figures published by the U.S. Labor Department.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected producer prices to rise 0.2 percent from September. 
But for a core measure of producer price pressures, cost gains slowed, the data showed. Producer prices outside food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent in October, down from a 0.4 percent gain in September. Compared to a year earlier, these core prices were up 2.8 percent, compared to 2.9 percent in the 12 months through September. 
U.S. stocks opened lower as a batch of weak Chinese data raised concerns about global growth. Yields on U.S. government debt, however, fell.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Thursday and said it remained on track to continue raising borrowing costs gradually. It is widely expected to raise rates in December.
The U.S. central bank has been slowly hiking interest rates since 2015 to keep inflation under control. The Fed seeks to keep prices for consumers rising 2 percent annually and monitors producer prices for signs that inflationary prices might be building.
In October, those inflationary pressures appeared strongest in relatively volatile goods and services. Producer prices for trade services, which include costs for retailing and wholesaling merchandise, rose 1.6 percent, the biggest gain since October 2014. Costs surged 2.7 percent for energy, the fastest increase in five months. 
U.S. consumers surveyed in November expect prices to rise 2.8 percent over the next year, according to the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment. That's down from an expectation of 2.9 percent in the university's October survey. Over the next five years, however, inflation expectations rose slightly. 
U.S. consumer sentiment has been on an upward trend since 2015, although the University of Michigan's November survey showed a slight cooling from October.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent in September, slightly faster than its initial estimate of a 0.3 percent increase. 
With U.S. job and wage growth bolstering domestic demand, businesses are expected to boost stocks of goods, which could underpin production at factories.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain enjoyed its fastest economic upturn since late 2016 during the third quarter, spurred by a surge in consumer spending over the hot summer and the soccer World Cup, which now appears to be tailing off ahead of Brexit.
The economy expanded 0.6 percent in the three months to September, matching the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and accelerating from 0.4 percent the quarter before, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.
Britain's growth outpaced the euro zone's by a large margin over the quarter, and finance minister Philip Hammond said the figures showed the underlying strength of the economy. 
Still, analysts said there were worrying signals for the months ahead, despite better-than-expected trade data.
Business investment unexpectedly fell 1.2 percent, the biggest drop since early 2016, adding to signs of rising caution among companies ahead of Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union in March.
""Looking beneath the surface, the uptick is skewed by the summer's buoyant, World Cup-fueled retail activity,"" said Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors.
""With order books weakening and major hiring and investment decisions being held back, business activity looks set to lose steam in the coming quarters.""
In September alone, Britain's economy stagnated for a second month running, compared with forecasts for a 0.1 percent expansion, while the annual growth rate held at 1.5 percent.
Sterling and British government bonds showed little reaction to the data, which were largely as expected.
SLIPPING DOWN THE RANKINGS
The figures showed net trade contributed 0.8 percentage points to the economic growth rate in the third quarter, the biggest boost since early 2016, as car imports dropped sharply -- tallying with weak car sales data.
Household spending remained solid, expanding 0.5 percent after a 0.4 percent rise in the second quarter.
Surveys of companies over the last month suggest growth looks likely to lose momentum in the final months of 2018, as the seasonal spending boost from increased eating and drinking fades away.
A Reuters poll of economists published on Friday suggested growth in the fourth quarter would decline to 0.3 percent, a view shared by the Bank of England.
Britain's growth slowed after the June 2016 Brexit vote, its annual rate slipping from top spot among the Group of Seven group of rich nations to jostling with long-term laggards Japan and Italy for last place.
Consumers in particular were squeezed by the jump in inflation that followed the pound's tumble after the referendum, especially as wages have failed to keep up.

On Thursday, the European Commission forecast Britain would rank joint-bottom with Italy for economic growth among EU nations in 2019.

The Labor Department said its producer price index increased 0.6% last month. In the 12 months through October, the PPI rose 2.9%.
Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.2% last month and increasing 2.5% from a year ago.
The core PPI increased by 0.5% from a month earlier and rose 2.6% in the 12 months through October.
Core PPI is a key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs.
The numbers support an expected increase of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed held interest rates steady on Thursday, as expected, but remained on track to continue gradually raising interest rates.
The central bank hiked U.S. interest rates three times this year and is widely expected to do so again in December.
The “growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year,” the Fed said in its statement, indicating the central bank sees some moderating of the economy, but is content with its slow and steady rate hike pace."

“The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued,” said Rob Kent-Smith the ONS’s head of national accounts.
Some signs of weakness in September pointed to slower growth ahead of Brexit. Slowing retail sales and a decrease in domestic car purchases were offset by growth in the services sector, which expanded by 0.4% in the third quarter.
Month-on-month, GDP was flat, falling short of forecasts for an expansion of 0.1%.

The sales drop to 2.38 million vehicles comes amid broader slowing economic growth and a biting trade war between China and the United States. It follows an 11.6 percent drop in September and a 3.8 percent fall in August.
The October drop set a record for the steepest monthly fall since a 26.4 percent tumble in January 2012, which was in part due to the timing of the China New Year holiday that year.
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said overall sales for the first 10 months of the year totalled 22.87 million vehicles, down 0.1 percent from the same period a year earlier. 

The industry body did not immediately give a reason for the drop in October, but last month cited the impact a sluggish economy and the trade war are having on sales.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian retail inflation likely slowed to its slowest pace in 12-months in October after food and fuel costs fell, keeping the official consumer prices gauge below the central bank's medium-term target for a third consecutive month, a Reuters poll found.
With the battered rupee gaining slightly against the dollar, a recent cut in fuel taxes and easing global crude oil costs, consumer price inflation likely slowed to 3.67 percent in October from 3.77 percent, according to the poll of 35 economists.
If the data meets forecasts, October will mark the third straight month retail inflation has been below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4 percent, supporting the central bank's surprise decision to hold interest rates at its meeting last month.
However, the RBI's shift in its stance to ""calibrated tightening"" from ""neutral"" at its Oct. 5 meeting suggests it may raise rates again, tracking other emerging market central banks grappling with weaker currencies as the U.S. Federal Reserve proceeds with a series of rate rises that have propped up the dollar.
""The key factors driving inflation are muted fuel and food prices. Both factors should keep monetary policy on a slightly somber note,"" said Shashank Mendiratta, economist at ANZ Bank, one of the most accurate forecasters of Indian inflation last year.
""But the tightening cycle has not ended yet, because there is still some upside risk to oil prices.""
The latest inflation data, due 1200 GMT on Nov. 12, will be the first since a set of accusations have surfaced from top RBI policymakers that the government is attempting to influence central bank policy.
While the government appears to have called a truce, economists say the administration's demands that the central bank relax lending curbs and relinquish surplus reserves pose a significant risk to the inflation outlook.
""The RBI has had success in anchoring inflation expectations over the past five years. Any erosion of independence could permanently reverse this trend, affecting spending and saving decisions and wage negotiations and ultimately push up actual inflation,"" noted Shilan Shah, senior Indian economist at Capital Economics. 
While core price pressures likely remained elevated again in October, wholesale price inflation probably eased to 5.00 percent from 5.13 percent in September. 

Industrial output likely expanded at an annual 4.3 percent pace in September, the same pace as in August, according to the median forecast of 24 economists.

764,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 11:33PM ET</span>",China's producer inflation slows again in October on ebbing domestic demand,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate inflation slowed for the fourth month in October on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity, signaling Beijing would likely roll out more growth-boosting measures in the face of trade frictions with the United States. 
Consumer prices, meanwhile, increased at the same pace in October from the previous month with food prices stable, official data from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday.
The producer price index (PPI), a measure of the prices businesses receive for their goods and services, rose 3.3 percent in October from a year earlier, easing from 3.6 percent in September, the statistics bureau said. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the October producer price inflation rate - also used by economists as a rough gauge of industrial profit trends - would ease to 3.3 percent. On a month-to-month basis, the PPI increased 0.4 percent.
""Rising import prices are likely to put some upward pressure on producer prices, but not enough to prevent PPI inflation from falling,"" said Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics.
""Indeed, we think policymakers will pay more attention to evidence that underlying price pressures remain subdued and will continue to ease policy over the coming months to shore up economic activity.""
Economic momentum in China has been softening in the past months, and last week President Xi Jinping acknowledged that the world's second-largest economy is facing ""growing downward pressure."" 
Underlying factory-gate inflation in recent months has been crimped by easing consumption, with China's fixed-asset investment growth hovering around record lows and industrial profit growth slowing for the fifth consecutive month in October.
Beijing's clamp-down on financial risks has also slowed credit demand somewhat, while many mid-sized companies have struggled to pass on higher prices to consumers. 
Private and official factory surveys have shown a worrying months-long downturn on export orders, suggesting Beijing's intensifying trade dispute with the United States is starting to put a strain on businesses. 
Government data on exports, however, highlighted remarkable strength, likely due to shippers rushing to beat higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods due to come into effect at the start of next year.
The rising headwinds to growth have prompted Beijing to ramp up stimulus measures - including cuts to cash banks must hold as reserves and higher fiscal spending - to spur domestic demand.
Raw material prices increased 6.7 percent in October from a year earlier, down from a 7.3 percent gain in September. Inflation in the fuel processing sector and chemicals manufacturing industry slowed in October from the previous month. 
YUAN IMPACT
Analysts believe inflation on both consumer and producer measures is set to cool through to the end of the year as China's economy slows and commodity prices fall, though the yuan's continued depreciation will put some upward pressure on import prices.
""If the renminbi weakens further over the months ahead as we expect, the cost of Chinese imports would continue to rise. That said, the impact of this on domestic prices wouldn’t be large,"" Capital Economics' Liu said. 
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.5 percent in October from a year earlier, same as September's rate and analysts' forecast. 
On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.2 percent, moderated from 0.7 percent gain in the preceding month.
The NBS attributed the monthly CPI slowdown to a fall in food prices, which dropped 0.3 percent from September despite supply disruptions caused by flooding and the outbreak of African swine flu.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.8 percent year-on-year in October, compared with 1.7 percent a month earlier.
China has set its consumer inflation goal at 3 percent for 2018, same as last year. The state planner recently said consumer prices are expected to remain within a reasonable range. 

""We expect inflation to be trending down in the coming months as economic activities continue to slow,"" Raymond Yeung, Greater China Chief Economist at ANZ said.

The Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight funds rate unchanged at 2.00% to 2.25% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.
The Fed raised rates by a quarter point for the third time this year in September and indicated one more rate hike for December.
The Fed said that ""the labor market has continued to strengthen,"" with economic activity rising at a ""strong"" rate, reinforcing investor expectations for a rate hike at the December meeting.
""Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined,"" the Fed said. ""Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.""
The mention of moderating business fixed investment was one of the small changes from the Fed's previous statement. 
Data last week showed that the U.S. economy produced more jobs than expected last month and wage growth remained intact. The unemployment rate held steady at a 48-year low.
Some market participants had been keen to get a sense of whether the October stock market rout would feature in the statement and possibly give the Fed reason to pause. But language in the statement was largely as expected, paving the way for the dollar to extend gains on improved expectations for a December hike.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.62% to 96.40.
Stock market reaction was muted. The S&P sold off quickly and rebounded just as quickly to settle in the same area it was before the statement came out.
Nearly 80% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike rates in December, above the 72% odds a day earlier, according to investing.com's Fed rate monitor tool.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will not follow up the monetary policy statement with a press conference, but that will change from the Dec. 19 meeting, with a press conference then expected after every Fed meeting."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Nov. 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 215,000 claims received, which was 1,000 more than previously reported. 
The weekly claims were in line with predictions of economists polled by Reuters, who had forecast 214,000 people would file for benefits. The Labor Department said claims for North Carolina continued to be affected by Hurricane Florence, while Hurricane Michael impacted those for Florida and Georgia. Claims data for Massachusetts was estimated.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to 213,750 in the latest week, a decline of 250 from the prior week's upwardly revised reading of 214,000.

The Federal Statistics Office said on Thursday that seasonally adjusted exports fell by 0.8 percent on the month in September, with imports down 0.4 percent.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.3 percent rise in exports and a 0.8 percent increase in imports. Germany's trade surplus narrowed to 17.6 billion euros ($20.09 billion) from a revised 18.2 billion euros in August.
""A combination of slowing world trade and temporary factors like the new emissions norms for autos hit the German export sector over the summer months,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski wrote in a research note.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth data for the third quarter next Wednesday.
Trade disputes abroad and political tensions at home are both leaving their mark on a still exports-dependent economy which is now in its ninth year of expansion.
Household spending has become an important growth driver for Germany as exports have weakened. Consumers are reaping the benefits of record employment levels, rising real wages, increased job security and cheap credit due to the euro zone's expansive monetary policy.
Nonetheless, several economic institutes said last week the German economy probably shrank in the third quarter after posting quarterly growth rates of 0.4 percent in the January-March period and 0.5 percent in the second quarter.

However, data released on Tuesday showed industrial orders rose unexpectedly in September, driven by bulk orders and higher demand from domestic and other euro zone clients, suggesting the economy ended the third quarter on a solid footing.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",China October exports surprisingly strong in race to beat higher U.S. tariffs,"By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported much stronger-than-expected exports for October as shippers rushed goods to the United States, its biggest trading partner, racing to beat higher tariff rates due to kick in at the start of next year. 
Import growth also defied forecasts for a slowdown, suggesting Beijing's growth-boosting measures to support the cooling economy may be slowly starting to make themselves felt. 
The upbeat trade readings from China offer good news for both those worried about global demand and for the country's policymakers after the economy logged its weakest growth since the global financial crisis in the third quarter.
October was the first full month after the latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect on Sept. 24, in a significant escalation in the tit-for-tat trade battle.
But analysts continue to warn of the risk of a sharp drop in U.S. demand for Chinese goods early in 2019, with all eyes now on whether presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping can make any breakthroughs on trade when they meet later this month.
China's exports rose 15.6 percent last month from a year earlier, customs data showed on Thursday, picking up from September's 14.5 percent and beating analysts' forecasts for a modest slowdown to 11 percent.
""The strong export growth in October was buoyed by front-loading activities by exporters...,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China Economist at ING in Hong Kong, noting the month is traditionally quieter due to long holidays.
""We expect exports to remain strong toward the end of the year as businesses are afraid of a failure in the Trump-Xi meeting, which could lead to broader tariffs on more Chinese goods from the U.S.,"" Pang said.
Washington has vowed to hike the tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent at the turn of the year, while Trump has warned that if talks with Xi are not productive, he could quickly slap tariffs on another $267 billion in Chinese imports.
Despite several rounds of U.S. duties this year, China's exports have been surprisingly resilient as firms ramped up shipments before even tougher measures went into effect.
Container ship rates from China to the U.S. West Coast remain near record highs, suggesting shipments will remain solid well into November and possibly early December. China's exports to the U.S. rose 13.2 percent from a year earlier in October.
In another positive sign, China's exports by volume also showed solid growth, according to Oxford Economics, which estimated they rose ""an impressive"" 9.9 percent.
But analysts say robust export readings won't last much longer, noting Chinese factory surveys have been showing contracting export orders for months.
U.S. orders for Chinese goods at the latest Canton fair dropped 30.3 percent from a year earlier by value, as higher U.S. tariffs made goods from batteries to farm tractors more expensive.
TRADE SURPLUS FUELING TENSIONS
Trump has railed against China over intellectual property theft, entry barriers to U.S. businesses and its persistently large trade surplus with the United States. Several rounds of talks this year have appeared to yield little progress.
For the first 10 months of the year, China's surplus with the United States, its largest export market, totaled $258.15 billion, widening sharply from $222.98 billion in the same period last year.
While the monthly surplus has eased somewhat to $31.78 billion in October from a record $34.13 billion in September, it remains elevated by historical trends.
For trade with all countries, China's surplus was around $34 billion for October, compared with forecasts of $35 billion and September's $31.69 billion. 
IMPORTS ALSO SURPRISINGLY SOLID
While China's exports are expected to falter soon, its imports, especially commodities, could remain strong for months to come as Beijing rolls out more measures such as infrastructure spending to boost domestic demand, economists at ANZ said. 
Imports for October quickened to 21.4 percent from 14.3 percent in September, beating analysts' forecasts for a slight cooling to 14 percent.
China's crude oil imports in October rose to all-time high as private refiners rushed to stock up ahead of winter, while demand for copper and iron ore was also solid though down from September levels.
China cut import taxes on more goods including machinery from Nov. 1, on top of reductions implemented earlier this year, to reduce costs for consumers and companies.
""Import growth also overshot expectations quite a lot. Import growth actually reflects some front-loading in China as well - buying before Chinese tariffs come into effect,"" Chi Lo, greater China economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), told Reuters.
""More importantly, it also reflects some of Beijing's promise to buy more - as a way to help soothe the trade conflict with the U.S.""
President Xi told a trade expo in Shanghai this week that he expects China to import $30 trillion worth of goods and $10 trillion worth of services in the next 15 years.
Last year, Xi estimated that China would import $24 trillion worth of goods over the coming 15 years.

Banks likely extended 862 billion yuan ($196.56 billion) in net new yuan loans in October, a traditionally weaker month due to long holidays, according to the poll, which surveyed 32 analysts. 
While the figure appears modest compared with the 1.38 trillion yuan increase in new loans in September, it would mark the biggest October gain since Reuters started compiling the data in 1990. 
Chinese policymakers have stepped up efforts in recent months to keep credit flowing to struggling smaller firms, especially private companies which account for 60 percent of the economy and 80 percent of urban jobs. But banks prefer dealing with firms which have state banking, considering them lower risk.
Serena Zhou, China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong, said the drop in loans from September did not suggest a significant change in policy direction.
""The expected dip was mainly due to unfavorable seasonality in October,"" said Zhou, referring to the National Day lull. 
She estimates the October average for the past three years was even lower, at 663 billion yuan. 
The impact on smaller firms has been compounded by mounting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory measures in kind by Beijing, which is hurting sales and driving up operating costs. But investment and consumption in China had already been showing signs of slowing before the trade dispute flared.
China has released net liquidity worth 2.3 trillion yuan ($332.04 billion) into the market by reducing banks' reserve requirements this year, after offsetting maturing medium-term lending facility loans, according to central bank chief Yi Gang. 
Broad M2 money supply was seen rising 8.4 percent in October from a year earlier, slightly higher than September's pace of 8.3 percent, according to the poll.
Annual outstanding yuan loan growth was seen at 13.3 percent in October, also reflecting a marginal pick-up from September.
Total new bank loans in January-September jumped 17.7 percent from a year earlier to 13.14 trillion yuan, and are on track for another record year.
But the increased lending has barely compensated for shrinking shadow loans as regulators continued their crackdown on riskier types of financing. The shadow banking sector has been a significant source of funds for private firms. 
A shift to more aggressive credit easing at the same time as business is slowing could also risk a flareup in debt in China, undermining a multi-year government campaign to reduce systemic financial risks. Corporate bond defaults are on track to hit a record this year. 
""Activity growth is in a tug of war. Administrative policy loosening has stepped up, but local governments still face a dilemma as the central government has also made requests to control local government debt,"" analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote this week.
""Weaker sentiment because of the trade dispute has continued to weigh on domestic economic activities such as car sales.""

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is due to release the October lending and money supply data sometime during Nov. 10-15.

Monthly inflation decelerated to 148 percent from 233 percent in September, the data showed, but left the OPEC nation on track to reach the 1 million percent inflation in 2018 expected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after five straight years of recession. 
""The figure is still scandalously high,"" said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado. The legislature has become the only source for economic indicators after the central bank stopped publishing such information nearly three years ago as the economy unraveled amid a collapse in crude oil prices.
Socialist President Nicolas Maduro in August slashed five zeroes off the ailing bolivar currency and boosted the minimum wage thirty-fold in an effort to stabilize inflation, which has eroded purchasing power and contributed to an exodus that has seen 2 million Venezuelans migrate since 2015.
But inflation has continued unabated. Critics blame years of government intervention in the economy through strict foreign exchange restrictions and price controls for the economic collapse, which has led to chronic shortages of food, medicine and other basic goods.
Maduro blames a U.S.-led ""economic war"" for Venezuela's woes, arguing that sanctions imposed by Washington are intended to destabilize his government and control the country's oil wealth.

Local economists are concerned that inflation could accelerate in the final two months of the year due to bonuses paid to state workers to boost purchasing power during the holiday season. The IMF expects hyperinflation to reach 10 million percent in 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. borrowers filed the fewest applications to buy a home and to refinance one in nearly four years last week as some 30-year mortgage rates increased to their highest levels in about 8-1/2 years, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based industry group's seasonally adjusted gauge on mortgage requests, which is seen as a proxy on future housing activity, fell 4.0 percent to 316.2 in the week ended Nov. 2. This was the weakest reading since December 2014.
Home borrowing costs rose last week in step with higher bond yields due to upbeat payrolls data last month which showed wages recording their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years.
""Rates increased slightly last week, as various job market indicators showed a bounce back in job gains and an acceleration in wage growth in October,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasts, in a statement.

Interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages, whose balances are $453,100 or less, on average rose to 5.15 percent, the highest since April 2010. Last week, they averaged 5.11 percent.
Other 30-year mortgage rates were up 3 basis points to 7 basis points last week.
Rising rates, together with tight housing inventories, have hurt loan demand to buy a home.
""It’s evident that housing inventory shortages continue to impact prospective homebuyers this fall,” Kan said.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on purchase mortgages fell 5 percent to 213.6, the lowest in two years.
The group's seasonally adjusted measure on mortgage refinancing activity decreased 2.5 percent last week to 861.8. It held above a near 18-year low of 838.1 reached a month ago.

The share of refinancing as a part of total applications shrank to 39.1 percent from 39.4 percent the week before.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 03:58AM ET</span>",German industry output edges up on strong building sector,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose slightly more than expected in September, helped by strong growth in construction, data showed on Wednesday, suggesting that a weaker third quarter in Europe's largest economy may be temporary.
Fears about a trade war with the United States and the risk of a disorderly Brexit are weighing on growth expectations, and leaked government documents have shown economic advisors slashing their forecasts for this year.
Economy Ministry data showed industrial output was up 0.2 percent in September, just beating a Reuters forecast for a meager 0.1 percent rise, the second consecutive monthly increase after the August figure was revised up to 0.1 percent.
Previously, it had reported a 0.3 percent decrease.
""The increase in production in September is pleasing but we're not in the clear .. industrial production has contracted significantly in the third quarter,"" said Sophia Krietenbrink of Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce. 
Striking a more upbeat tone, the Economy Ministry said a weak phase in the industrial sector in the third quarter was temporary and mostly linked to slower production in the auto sector due to adjustments for a new pollution standard. 
""A revival in industrial production is expected by the end of the year,"" said the ministry in a statement.
Output in the construction sector rose by 2.2 percent in September while it fell by 1.0 percent in the intermediate goods branch and by 3.3 percent in the energy sector.
The output data followed an unexpected rise in order data in September, driven by big ticket items and higher domestic and euro zone demand. 
Several economic institutes said last week the German economy probably shrank in the third quarter after posting 0.4 percent growth in the first quarter and 0.5 percent growth in the second.
The NBR group of local newspapers reported on Tuesday that the German government's economic advisors, who present their report later on Wednesday, had cut this year's growth forecast to 1.6 percent from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent.

For next year, they now see 1.5 percent growth, down from their earlier forecast of 1.8 percent.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>","Food prices lift Brazil October inflation, but spike set to fade","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Rising food prices likely drove Brazil's inflation rate to a 1-1/2 year high in October, a Reuters poll showed, but that spike is likely to fade in coming months.
That should give the central bank plenty of leeway to hold interest rates at an all-time low as it seeks to strengthen an underwhelming economic recovery.
Consumer prices tracked by the benchmark IPCA index probably rose 4.66 percent in the 12 months through October, according to the median of 18 forecasts ranging from 4.50 to 4.77 percent.  
That would be the highest reading since mid-March 2017, firmly above the 4.5 percent midpoint of the central bank's 2018 target range. Yet the headline figure likely overstates inflationary pressures in Latin America's largest economy, economists said.
When stripped of volatile items such as power and food costs, the inflation rate has been hovering closer to 3.5 percent.
In fact, once those one-off pressures subside, Citibank economists expect inflation to end 2018 at 4.3 percent before falling to 4.25 percent in 2019 -- the exact midpoint of the central bank's target range for that year.
The IPCA, scheduled for Wednesday at 9:00 a.m. local time (1100 GMT), likely rose 0.55 percent from October, the survey showed. 
Such a result would largely confirm the central bank's assessment that monetary policy ought to remain loose and allow it to hold off from hiking in the short-term. 

The victory of far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro in the presidential election, embraced by investors as a sign that belt-tightening reforms are coming soon, also reduced the risk of a currency selloff that could bump up import costs and wider inflation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth slumped to a two-year low in October as growing trade tensions and tariffs, alongside rising political uncertainty, put a dent in exports and optimism, a survey showed on Tuesday.
However, while survey and official figures on Tuesday showed the slowdown is relatively widespread, the clouds over the euro zone are not as dark as recently feared.
Any positive signs will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank as they look to halt their 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program by the end of the year, shutting off one of the main sources of stimulus to the euro zone economy.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, fell to 53.1 in October from September's 54.1, its lowest since September 2016.
But it was above a 52.7 flash estimate and still comfortably higher than the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.
""The underlying progress in the economy looks pretty solid,"" said James Nixon at Oxford Economics.
Official figures showed that industrial orders in Germany rose just 0.3 percent in September but a Reuters poll had predicted a 0.6 percent fall, suggesting Europe's biggest economy ended the third quarter on a solid footing.
And the final German services PMI was revised up to 54.7 from a preliminary reading of 53.6 - one of the biggest upward adjustments in the survey's history.
Activity in France accelerated as companies stepped up hiring after an increase in new business and Spain's service sector expanded at its fastest rate since June, also supported by growth in new business, earlier PMIs showed.
""October's PMI data suggests that most of the major euro zone economies will perform a little better in Q4 than in Q3,"" noted Jack Allen at Capital Economics. 
As a whole, the bloc's economy expanded 0.2 percent in the third quarter, official data showed late last month, and a Reuters poll predicted it would be 0.4 percent this quarter. 
But Italy's service sector contracted for the first time in more than two years last month in a sign the euro zone's third largest economy is struggling.
Markets barely moved after Tuesday's releases as traders braced for mid-term elections in the United States and some potentially lively sessions ahead. 
Muddying the outlook for the region, Italy's government is in a stand-off with the European Commission over its borrowing and longstanding German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she would not be seeking re-election as head of her party.
Whether Britain and the European Union part ways amicably and an ongoing trade war between the United States and China also took its toll on business optimism. The future output index fell to a near four-year low of 60.5 from 62.1. 
""There are clearly negative headwinds coming from the fears of trade protectionism and stock markets have had a bit of a wobble,"" Nixon said.
""But the headline falls we have seen in GDP and some of the survey data are massively overstating the effect of those headwinds.""
A sister survey on Friday showed factory activity in the euro zone grew at its weakest pace in more than two years last month as export orders fell for the first time since late 2014 and the latest release suggests the slowdown is enveloping the bloc's dominant services sector. 
The euro zone services PMI fell to 53.7 from September's 54.7, a low not seen since the start of 2017, but above the 53.3 flash reading.

Adding to evidence of a slowdown, new business growth was at its second lowest since the start of 2017. The sub-index registered 53.9, down from 54.8 in September.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers index for services rose in October to 55.3 from 54.8 in September, although this was worse than a preliminary reading of 55.6.
The index rose further away from the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
IHS Markit's overall PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, rose marginally to 54.1 from a 21-month low of 54.0 in September, worse than the 54.3 originally reported.
In France's dominant service sector, companies took on new workers at the fastest pace since February while the flow of new business was the best since April.
""Panellists often mentioned strong demand conditions in their reasoning for increases,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said. 
However, optimism for the future eased slightly as input prices continued to grow much faster than service providers' selling prices, squeezing their margins.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 03:43AM ET</span>",Surprise rise in German orders eases growth concerns,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose unexpectedly in September, driven by bulk orders and higher demand from domestic and other euro zone clients, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting Europe's largest economy ended the third quarter on a solid footing.
Orders edged up 0.3 percent after an upwardly revised increase of 2.5 percent in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. That beat market expectations for a fall of 0.6 percent.
""The small increase is pushing growth concerns into the background,"" Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger said. 
For the third quarter as a whole, industrial orders fell 1.0 percent on weak foreign demand, the Economy Ministry said. This suggests manufacturing hardly contributed to overall economic growth in the July-September period.
""Bulk orders were the main driver behind the slight increase in September,"" DIHK economist Sophia Krietenbrink said.
""Nevertheless, there is a clear downward trend for the first three quarters,"" she added. Krietenbrink said business sentiment was deteriorating due to international trade tensions, weaker global demand and higher energy and commodity prices.
The Economy Ministry pointed to special factors in the automobile sector, where the introduction of new regulation has caused production delays.
""The development of industrial orders in August and September suggests that bottlenecks in vehicle registration due to new testing rules for cars (WLTP) are slowly clearing up,"" the ministry said.
The new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to halt deliveries of some models that had yet to be re-certified.
The ministry said manufacturing was likely to propel growth in the fourth quarter as many companies are still enjoying an unusually high level of orders.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth data next week.

Several economic institutes said last week the German economy probably shrunk in the third quarter after posting quarterly growth rates of 0.4 percent in the first and 0.5 percent in the second quarter.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected to shrink in the third quarter after natural disasters disrupted production and a slowdown in overseas demand undermined exports, a Reuters poll found on Tuesday.
Strong typhoons in western Japan and a powerful earthquake in the northern island of Hokkaido forced some factories and major airports to close temporarily. 
Analysts believe Japan's economy will recover from the setbacks caused by the quarter's natural disasters, but see risks to growth from declining momentum in the global economy. 
Spillover effects from the US-China trade dispute were also a worry, they said. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew an annualised 3.0 percent in April-June on strong capital spending, the fastest growth since 2016, but was seen shrinking 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in July-September, an annualized rate of 1.0 percent.
""Data will likely show the economy was at a standstill,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
He sees the economy remaining on a recovery trend, led by the corporate sector, but noted that a slowdown in exports was a concern because some overseas markets were softening.
""We need to take heed of the risk that the pace of economic recovery in October-December in Japan may be weak - depending on the global economy.""
The poll found capital spending would be flat in July-September after growing 3.1 percent in the second quarter.
Analysts project capex will recover on demand for labor-saving technologies to cope with labor shortages and construction work for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. 
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of GDP, was seen slipping 0.2 percent for the quarter, following a 0.7 percent gain in April-June. 
External demand - or exports minus imports - was seen likely to take 0.1 percentage point off GDP growth, the poll showed.
SMBC Nikko Securities expects the economy will return to growth in the fourth quarter as it recovers from the effects of natural disasters. 
""But...the global economy has already hit its peak and there is a growing risk that downward pressure from the Sino-U.S. trade war could intensify in 2019,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The Cabinet Office will publish the GDP data on Nov. 14 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, Nov. 13).

Business expectations for the year-ahead improved to their strongest level since July 2011, which companies that took part in the monthly survey attributed to a sustained rise in new business and increased advertising.
The index's headline figure rose to 56.9 in October from 54.7 in September, remaining above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction since early 2016.
""Notably, output was driven by stronger domestic demand, with total new business rising at the quickest pace in close to a year,"" said Sian Jones, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Employment in the services sector rose in October for the first time since May even though the increase was fractional, while the rate of inflation picked up for the second month in a row, the survey showed.
Input prices increased and companies passed greater cost burdens on to clients through higher charges.

Last week, a separate PMI report showed Russian manufacturing activity expanded in October at the fastest pace in six months thanks to growing output and new orders.

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 60.3 in October, from 61.6 the previous month.
Economists had forecast a reading of 59.3.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector, and a reading below 50 signals contraction.
“The non-manufacturing sector has again reflected strong growth despite a slight cooling off after a record month in September,” ISM chair Anthony Nieves explained in the report. “There are continued concerns about capacity, logistics and tariffs,” he added but noted that “respondents are positive about current business conditions and the economy.”

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to six-month high at 52.4 on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 50.2 September.
It marked the 25th consecutive month that the index held above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction.
Some of the momentum seen last month though may peter out as new business expansion was largely driven by new contracts and work to recover from an earthquake and other natural disasters in September.
""Business activity expanded at the fastest pace in six months as firms observed the best monthly improvement in demand conditions since May 2013,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""However, many respondents noted that the rise in both output and new sales was a normalization effect following the business impact of natural disasters in September.""
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, also rose to a five-month high of 52.5 from 50.7 in the previous month.
Businesses in the northern island of Hokkaido quickly resumed operations after a strong earthquake caused a island-wide blackout last month.
Business confidence remained solid due to optimistic sales forecasts and plans to increase investment, the survey showed.
That should be welcome news for policy makers as globally manufacturers are facing pressure from the heated U.S.-China trade war as well as a potential peak in corporate earnings. 

A separate survey on Japan's manufacturing PMI for October earlier this week showed the sector expanded at the fastest rate in four months. It was helped by new export orders returning to growth in a sign the world third biggest economy is exhibiting some resilience to global trade frictions.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity in Britain's dominant services sector slowed to a seven-month low last month and firms' expectations for the coming year are the gloomiest since just after the 2016 Brexit vote, a major survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 52.2 in October from 53.9 in September, its lowest since a patch of unusually icy weather in March and a bigger fall than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
Britain's economy has slowed since the June 2016 referendum, and Monday's data added to signs that a patch of solid consumer-led growth over the summer months is now fading as firms focus on risks from Brexit and warning signs about the global economy.
""With autumn upon us, consumers are tightening their belts. And with the prospect of any greater certainty seemingly as distant as ever, businesses ... are struggling to maintain their confident outlook,"" said Chris Sood-Nicholls, a managing director at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank's commercial lending unit.
Businesses' expectations for stronger activity over the next 12 months were the weakest since July 2016, when they briefly hit a post-financial crisis low following the vote to leave the European Union.
Sterling briefly dipped to a day's low against the U.S. dollar after the data, but market reaction was muted overall.
Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to agree a withdrawal deal with the EU to ensure goods, services and workers will continue to be able to cross borders easily after Britain leaves the bloc on March 29 next year.
GLOBAL ECONOMY WORRIES
Businesses also reported headwinds from a slowing global economy, trade tensions, and financial market turbulence.
""It therefore remains unclear as to the extent to which Brexit worries are exacerbating or obfuscating a more broad-based slowing of the economy,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
Last week the Bank of England forecast Britain's rate of economic growth would halve to 0.3 percent in the final three months of 2018 from an estimated 0.6 percent in the third quarter of the year, when good weather lifted consumer spending. 
But Governor Mark Carney said the central bank would look beyond what it expects to be short-term growth volatility, and might need to raise interest rates faster than markets expect if Brexit ends up going relatively smoothly.
The weak services data follows the softest manufacturing PMI since the Brexit vote.
The two PMIs, combined with more robust construction data, are jointly the weakest since March and point to quarterly growth of 0.2 percent if things do not improve, IHS Markit said.
Businesses said new orders were coming in at the slowest rate since July 2016, and their costs were rising at the fastest rate since June due to higher fuel bills and rising wages.
However, they expected orders to pick up if the Brexit talks were concluded successfully.
The services PMI in Britain does not include the public sector or retailers, who enjoyed strong consumer spending over the summer but face longer-term challenges from online sales.

Consumer-facing firms such as hotels, restaurants and leisure companies reported the weakest PMI performance.

Research firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.2 in October from 53.9 in the previous month and weaker than forecasts for a reading of 53.3.
“The disappointing server sector numbers bring mounting evidence that Brexit worries are taking an increasing toll on the economy. Combined with the manufacturing and construction surveys, the October services PMI points to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.2%, setting the scene for GDP growth to weaken sharply in the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
""The economy is facing other headwinds, including a broader global slowdown, trade wars, heightened geopolitical uncertainty and tightening financial market conditions. It therefore remains unclear as to the extent to which Brexit worries are exacerbating or obfuscating a more broad-based slowing of the economy, which would have important implications for policymaking.”
New business growth slowed for the third time in the past four months in October. Companies noted that Brexit-related uncertainty and concerns over the global economic outlook had constrained demand for business services.
The survey also indicated that the degree of positive sentiment for the year ahead sank to its lowest level since July 2016 amid uncertainty over Brexit and concerns over the broader economic outlook.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 02:21AM ET</span>","Indonesia's third quarter GDP growth slows as consumer, export sectors struggle","By Maikel Jefriando and Nilufar Rizki
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's economic growth slowed in the third quarter, losing momentum from the previous three months and pointing to tougher conditions for the Southeast Asian economy, which has struggled with capital outflows and weaker exports and household spending.
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 5.17 percent in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said on Monday, compared with a 5.15 percent expansion expected in a Reuters poll and the second quarter's 5.27 percent. The April-June quarter pace was the fastest since late 2013.
The slowdown was largely due to softer household consumption in the third quarter and a negative contribution from foreign trade.
Although the expansion was a notch faster than expected, economists warn growth may weaken further.
""We think growth will tend to be slower in the coming future due to the impact of weakening rupiah,"" Fakhrul Fulvian, Jakarta-based chief economist of Trimegah Securities said. He expects GDP to grow 5.13 percent in 2018 and 5 percent in 2019.
The rupiah <IDR=> is down around 9 percent this year, making it the second worst performing currency among emerging Asian markets.
Though a weaker currency has not stoked inflation, the central bank has raised interest rates five times since May to slow capital outflows in a measure analysts say could dampen domestic demand.
Capital Economics emerging Asia analyst Alex Holmes said growth will probably stay around 5 percent over the next couple of years.
""A key drag on growth over the next year is likely to be the export sector,"" Holmes said in a note, adding that weaker global growth and subdued commodity prices could hold back export revenues.
Weaker coal and palm oil prices have been a drag on Indonesia's exports, with the fall in the local currency unable to offset the hit to revenues from the softer commodity prices.
The export sector's contribution to GDP in the third quarter was wiped by imports. Indonesia's statistics bureau chief, Suhariyanto, blamed this on declining non-oil and gas commodity prices as well as slower growth in main trading partners like China and Singapore.
Stronger investment and government spending also failed to mitigate slowing household consumption, which accounts for more than half of Indonesia's GDP.
While a trade war between the United States and China is expected to hurt economic growth in the region, most analysts say Indonesia, which is less integrated into global production supply chains than its regional peers, will not be among the worst hit.
The trade war, however, could pressure Indonesia's economy through its financial markets.
In addition to Bank Indonesia's rate hikes, the government has delayed infrastructure projects and raised tariffs for a wide range of consumer goods, which could further hurt growth.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Rahul Bajoria said tighter fiscal policy next year also clouds growth outlook.
While the government's official GDP growth target this year is 5.4 percent, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati last month told parliament 2018 growth was more likely to be 5.14 percent.
The government projects growth at 5.3 percent for next year.
Andry Asmoro, Bank Mandiri's economist, said the third quarter growth figures were unlikely to affect the central bank's monetary stance.
""The global challenge is still huge and prioritising stability over growth remains relevant in the current environment,"" he said.

Although the rate of growth in new business has slowed, Irish service providers continued to experience strong inflows of new work in October, with an increase in orders from the United Kingdom that respondents put down to weakness in the euro.
The survey also showed that the rate of prices charged ticked up, with Irish service providers passing on higher business costs such as insurance to their customers.

The Emirates NBD Egypt Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the non-oil private sector weakened to 48.6 in October from 48.7 in September, below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
September's return to contraction followed expansionary readings in July and August.
Daniel Richards, MENA economist at Emirates NBD, said the data ""suggests that private sector firms remain under pressure as Egypt's IMF-sponsored economic reform program continues"".
""That being said, the reading is still far higher than those seen at the start of the process in November 2016, and future expectations remain robust.""
The PMI has had an average reading of 47.9 since the International Monetary Fund reform program began.
The non-oil private-sector sector saw a decline in output for the second consecutive month, which companies attributed to lower demand for goods and services due to challenging market conditions.
Companies also saw a decrease in export orders in October, though at a slower pace than seen in September, which they linked to challenging economic conditions in international markets.
Egypt's fiscal year runs from July to June.
Egypt has been implementing a series of tough economic reforms as part of the three-year $12 billion deal with the IMF. Measures included devaluing the Egyptian pound, slashing energy subsidies and imposing new taxes in an attempt to draw back investors who fled during the 2011 uprising.

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.8 in October from 53.1 in September, the lowest since September 2017, and creeping closer to the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
Any prolonged weakness in the services sector would complicate Beijing's efforts to steady growth in the face of the trade dispute with the United States, a manufacturing slowdown at home and campaigns to curb excess capacity, pollution and corporate debt. 
A cooling this year of the Chinese property market, another major contributor to the economy, has also weighed on demand for real estate services. 
Significantly, Caixin's sub-index for new business orders showed virtually no growth at 50.1 in October, down from 52.4 the previous month and the worst performance since a contraction in November 2008 during the global financial crisis. 
That dented business confidence towards future activity to a three-month low, according to the survey. 
The nation's financial services sector was especially hard-hit by the subdued market conditions. 
China is leaning on services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to reduce the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment. 
Some firms surveyed by Caixin also expressed concerns of the possible impact of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute on future activity. 
The impact of the trade frictions on business confidence, and real activity, was starting to show in the broader economy.
A separate Caixin survey published last week showed China's manufacturing sector hardly grew in October after stalling in the previous month. 
October was the first full month after the latest U.S. tariffs went into effect. 
Washington and Beijing slapped additional tariffs on each other's goods on Sept. 24, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to hit China with more duties.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Monday, fell to 50.5 in October from 52.1 a month earlier. That was the lowest level since June 2016. 
Offering a glimmer of hope, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had what the U.S. president described as a ""very good"" phone discussion about trade last week. 
Plans were being made for them to meet on the sidelines of the G20 leaders summit in Argentina at the end of November.
SUPPORT FOR PRIVATE FIRMS
Beijing has already stepped up liquidity support for the economy by cutting the level of cash banks must hold as reserves four times so far this year, and is also boosting fiscal spending. 
President Xi on Thursday promised to help China's struggling private firms, which dominate the services sector.
He pledged to roll out more tax cuts and financial aid, underscoring government resolve to back-stop the private sector as the world's second-largest economy slows.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a slower-than-expected 6.5 percent in the third quarter, its weakest since the global financial crisis. 
After declining for the first time in more than two years in September, employment in China's services sector increased at the start of the fourth quarter as some businesses hired additional workers to expand business operations, the Caixin survey showed. 
While the uptick would provide some respite to policymakers concerned about unemployment, the rate of payroll growth was marginal and weaker than the historical trend, the Caixin survey shows. 
Economists say business conditions will get worse before they can get better.

792,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Australia's Property Slump Casts Doubt on Household Spending,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s falling house prices are raising doubts about the resilience of household spending.
There are signs of weakness emerging, with data Friday showing retail sales growth tumbled sharply in the third quarter. Australians were happy to fund higher spending by putting away less savings as the value of their homes increased. But when prices drop, as they have nationwide for 13 months, building a buffer traditionally becomes the priority over shopping.
For Governor Philip Lowe, uncertainty about consumption has been one of his more regular warnings on the economy. It’s also a key reason why the Reserve Bank of Australia’s board is set to keep the cash rate unchanged at a record-low 1.5 percent Tuesday for a 25th meeting. Record household debt and stagnant incomes mean there’s little scope to absorb higher borrowing costs.
“There will be a need for more deleveraging,” Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at Pacific Investment Management Co., said in an interview in Hong Kong following a visit Down Under.
“If house prices continue to fall, which looks quite likely, you will probably see consumer spending slowing as well. Whether that is enough to push Australia into a recession is a different question. We are not forecasting a recession in Australia but a slowdown looks quite likely,” said Fels.
Data Friday showed retail sales rose just 0.2 percent last quarter, from 1 percent in the previous three months, while a report two days earlier showed inflation still subdued.
The RBA releases its quarterly updated forecasts Friday. One risk to the outlook cited in the previous Statement on Monetary Policy was spending, with the central bank noting that housing accounts for about 55 percent of total household assets.
“Lower housing prices could lead to lower consumption growth than is currently forecast,” it said in August. “Although the earlier gains in national housing wealth may not have encouraged much additional consumption, it is possible that the consumption decisions of highly indebted and/or credit-constrained households could be more sensitive to declines in housing prices.”

793,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Cuba lowers economic growth forecast as trade continues to drop,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba’s economic growth will come in at around 1 percent this year, compared with the 2 percent previously forecast, due to a fall in exports and tourism revenue, state-run media reported over the weekend.
The Caribbean island's gross domestic product grew 1.8 percent last year and 0.5 percent in 2016.
Economy and Planning Minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez reportedly told a council of ministers meeting that the lowered GDP growth forecast for this year was due to ""less than expected revenues from activities such as tourism, the harvest (sugar) and mining (nickel),"" three key revenue sources for Cuba.
Gil said austerity measures, which began in 2016, would continue into 2019. They include cuts in energy and fuel to state companies and reduced imports of consumer goods and inputs for the economy.
Cuba's economy is notoriously inefficient and dependent on foreign revenues. The government also spends a large amount of its revenue on the country's free healthcare system, education and other services.
The Trump administration is also tightening sanctions on Cuba that have been in place for more than a half a century and which were loosened a bit under former U.S. President Barack Obama.
Some economists have estimated that Cuba's import dependence is as much as 17 cents for every dollar of product produced.
Cuba's GDP fell 35 percent in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, which supported the country financially during the Cold War.
The rise of Hugo Chavez and his Venezuelan socialist revolution led to a partial revival of the Cuban economy as Venezuelan oil was sold to Havana at favorable terms and Cuba sent doctors and other goods to its ally. But the trade relationship has deteriorated due to Venezuela’s economic crisis and declining oil exports.
Cuba’s export revenues have declined every year since 2014, even as debt payments mounted, offset somewhat by increased revenues from telecommunications and remittances, though those earnings are treated as state secrets.
Combined exports and imports fell around 25 percent from 2013 through 2017, with imports dropping to $11.3 billion from $15.6 billion during that period, according to the government.
In August, the government slapped a hold on already approved ""non-essential"" imports.
Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who currently teaches at the Universidad Javeriana Cali in Colombia, said the country was piling up budget deficits to keep the economy growing. Cuba's budget deficit reached 8 billion pesos last year, nearly 9 percent of its GDP, Vidal said.

""This helps stimulate growth, but by accumulating a financial bubble in the form of public bonds in the hands of state banks,"" he said. ""It can't go on forever.""

Factory goods orders rose 0.7 percent amid strong demand for transportation equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Data for August was revised up to show factory orders surging 2.6 percent instead of the previously reported 2.3 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 0.5 percent in September. Orders increased 8.4 percent on a year-on-year basis in September.
Worker shortages, an increasingly bitter trade war between the United States and China, a strong dollar and slowing global economic growth are restraining momentum in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
An Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturers published on Thursday showed a measure of new factory orders dropping to a 1-1/2-year low in October.
In September, orders for transportation equipment increased 1.9 percent, reflecting a 118.7 percent jump in orders for defense aircraft and parts. Transportation equipment orders soared 13.3 percent in August.
Orders for civilian aircraft and parts tumbled 17.5 percent in September. Orders for motor vehicles rose 0.5 percent.
There were increases in orders for primary metals, machinery and computers and electronic products in September. Orders for electronic equipment, appliances and components fell.
The Commerce Department also said September orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, slipped 0.1 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods fell 0.2 percent in August.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, dipped 0.1 percent in September instead of being unchanged as reported last month.
Core capital goods shipments fell 0.1 percent in August. Business spending on equipment stalled in the third quarter.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>",U.S. trade gap widens; deficit with China rises to record high,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit rose to a seven-month high in September as imports surged to a record high amid strong domestic demand, offsetting a rebound in exports.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap increased 1.3 percent to $54.0 billion, widening for a fourth straight month. Data for August was revised to show the trade deficit rising to $53.3 billion instead of the previously reported $53.2 billion.
The trade deficit continues to deteriorate despite the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has left the United States locked in a bitter trade war with China as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with other trade partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China jumped 4.3 percent to a record high of $40.2 billion in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall trade deficit rising to $53.6 billion in September.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade gap increased to an all-time high of $87.0 billion in September from $86.3 billion in August.
The government reported last week that the trade deficit subtracted 1.78 percentage points from gross domestic product in the third quarter. That was the most since the second quarter of 1985 and reversed the 1.22 percentage points contribution in the April-June period.
In September, imports of goods and services increased 1.5 percent to $266.6 billion, an all-time high. Imports of capital goods such as telecommunications equipment, civilian aircraft engines and computers were the highest on record.
There were also increases in imports of toys, cell phones, apparel and household goods.
Exports of goods and services rose 1.5 percent to $212.6 billion in September. Exports were lifted by shipments of industrial supplies and materials, which were the highest on record. Soybean exports decreased by $0.7 billion in September.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 09:16AM ET</span>",U.S. job growth jumps; annual wage gain biggest since 2009,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in December.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate steady at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent even as more people entered the labor force, in a sign of confidence in the jobs market.
Sustained labor market strength could ease fears about the economy's health following weak housing data and stalling business spending. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 250,000 jobs last month as employment in the leisure and hospitality sector bounced back after being held down by Hurricane Florence, which drenched North and South Carolina in mid-September. 
There were also big gains in manufacturing, construction and professional and business services payrolls. Data for September was revised to show 118,000 jobs added instead of the previously reported 134,000. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 190,000 jobs in October and the unemployment rate unchanged at 3.7 percent. The Labor Department said Hurricane Michael, which struck the Florida Panhandle in mid-October, ""had no discernible effect on the national employment and unemployment estimates for October."" 
Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent, in October after advancing 0.3 percent in September. That boosted the annual increase in wages to 3.1 percent, the biggest gain since April 2009, from 2.8 percent in September. 
Employers also increased hours for workers last month. The average workweek increased to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in September.
Strong annual wage growth mirrors other data published this week showing wages and salaries rising in the third quarter by the most since mid-2008. Hourly compensation also increased at a brisk pace in the third quarter.
Firming wages support views that inflation will hover around the Fed's 2.0 percent target for a while. The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding the volatile food and energy components has increased by 2.0 percent for five straight months. 
The Fed is not expected to raise rates at its policy meeting next week, but economists believe October's strong labor market data could see the U.S. central bank signal an increase in December. The Fed raised borrowing costs in September for the third time this year.
U.S. Treasury yields rose after the data while the U.S. dollar (DXY) pared gains against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock index futures pared gains.
WORKER SHORTAGE
Employers, scrambling to find qualified workers, are boosting wages. There are a record 7.14 million open jobs. 
Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) announced last month that it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees starting in November. Workers at United States Steel Corp (N:X) are set to receive a hefty pay rise also.
Employment gains have averaged 218,000 jobs per month over the past three months, double the roughly 100,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
That is seen supporting the economy through at least early 2019 when gross domestic product is expected to significantly slow as the stimulus from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.9 percent last month.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 7.4 percent last month from 7.5 percent in September. The employment-to-population ratio rose two-tenths of percentage point to 60.6 percent, the highest since January 2009. 
Last month, employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 42,000 jobs after being unchanged in September. Retail payrolls rose by only 2,400, likely restrained by layoffs related to Steinhoff's Mattress Firm bankruptcy as well as some store closures by Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ).
Construction companies hired 30,000 more workers in October. Jobs in the sector have been increasing despite weakness in the housing market. Government payrolls rose by 4,000 jobs in October.
Manufacturing employment increased by 32,000 jobs in October after adding 18,000 positions in September. Job gains in the sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, could slow after a survey on Thursday showed a measure of factory employment fell in October. 
So far, manufacturing hiring does not appear to have been affected by the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has contributed to capacity constraints at factories. The United States is locked in a bitter trade war with China as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with other trade partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.

Despite the protectionist measures, the trade deficit continues to deteriorate. In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the trade gap increased 1.3 percent to $54.0 billion in September, widening for a fourth straight month.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 01:24PM ET</span>","Bank of England hints at faster hikes, but says Brexit options wide open","By David Milliken and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Thursday that interest rates might need to rise a bit faster than investors expect, but it warned that all bets would be off if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal in less than five months.
The BoE's nine rate-setters all voted to hold rates at 0.75 percent, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists, after raising them in August for only the second time in a decade.
Governor Mark Carney said the BoE did not expect a disruptive no-deal Brexit, but if it happened, the central bank would be in uncharted territory and it was not possible to predict if rates would need to rise or fall in response.
Brexit is dominating the outlook for the world's fifth-largest economy which has slowed since 2016's referendum. 
""Since the nature of EU withdrawal is not known at present, and its impact on the balance of demand, supply and the exchange rate cannot be determined in advance, the monetary policy response will not be automatic and could be in either direction,"" Carney told a news conference.
The BoE cut rates and ramped up its bond-buying program after the shock referendum vote. Carney cautioned against assuming it would do the same in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Unlike 2016, inflation is above target and the BoE would be responding to actual economic damage, not a fall in confidence. 
Sterling would probably fall and push up inflation. Combined with a hit to supply chains and possible trade tariffs, that would argue for raising rates, Carney said. 
On the other hand, policymakers would need to balance the hit to growth from lost trade, uncertainty and tighter financial conditions. That would normally make a case for lower rates.
Sterling briefly edged up against the dollar  after the BoE policy announcement and was on track for one its biggest daily gains this year due to optimism about Brexit talks and broader dollar weakness.
The BoE penciled into its forecasts the bets in financial markets that there will be almost three quarter-point rate rises over the next three years. That compared with just over one in the forecasts that accompanied August's rate rise. 
Asked whether investors were pricing in enough rate hikes, Carney pointed to the BoE's forecast that inflation would still be above its target in two years' time, suggesting he thought investors were being a bit too cautious about the pace of hikes.
""November's statement makes it pretty clear the Bank of England would like to be hiking rates further,"" ING economist James Smith said. 
""But given that it may be quite some time before we know for sure that a no-deal Brexit has been avoided, we suspect policymakers will struggle to hike rates before May 2019 at the earliest.""
Most economists do not expect rates to rise again until the middle of next year.
CONSUMERS RESILIENT, BUSINESSES NERVOUS
The BoE said consumer spending had beaten its expectations but businesses were holding back on investment.
Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to secure a transition deal to ease Britain's exit from the EU. 
Assuming Brexit goes smoothly, the economy was likely to continue to grow by around 1.75 percent a year, the BoE said, below the rate of above 2 percent before the Brexit vote.
But the BoE said the economy was at full capacity and inflation would take three years to drop from 2.4 percent now to its 2 percent target.
The economy was expected to start running above capacity in late 2019, sooner than the BoE previously forecast, creating inflation pressure.
The forecasts did not include the stimulus from higher public spending and tax cuts in finance minister Philip Hammond's Oct. 29 budget. Like Carney, Hammond has said he might need to review his plans after Brexit.

""The (BoE) would be minded to offset such additional demand by raising interest rates a little more rapidly than the 'one hike per annum' over the next three years, which it is guiding toward,"" Investec economist Philip Shaw said.

802,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; manufacturing slowing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. unemployment aid fell last week and the number of Americans receiving benefits was the lowest in more than 45 years as labor market conditions tightened further.
Other data on Thursday showed worker productivity slowing in the third quarter, but still growing at a relatively decent clip and compensation surging, adding to recent reports and anecdotal evidence that the strong labor market was pushing up wage gains.
The economy's upbeat outlook was tempered by news that manufacturing activity slowed in October as a measure of new orders dropped to its lowest level in 1-1/2 years. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Oct. 27, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more claims received than previously reported. Claims fell to 202,000 during the week ended Sept. 15, which was the lowest level since November 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 213,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for North Carolina continued to be affected by Hurricane Florence, while Hurricane Michael impacted those for Florida and Georgia.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,750 to 213,750 last week.
The claims data has no bearing on October's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rebounded by 190,000 jobs in October after Florence depressed restaurant and retail payrolls in September. But the pick-up in job growth was likely tempered by Michael, which struck the Florida Panhandle in mid-October. 
Payrolls increased by 134,000 in September, the fewest in a year. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a near 49-year low of 3.7 percent in October.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
NEAR FULL EMPLOYMENT
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. There are a record 7.14 million open jobs in the economy, suggesting a shortage of skilled workers. 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 7,000 to 1.63 million for the week ended Oct. 20, the lowest level since July 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims decreased 6,250 to 1.64 million, the lowest level since August 1973.
In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.
That was a step down from the 3.0 percent pace logged in the April-June period, which was the strongest since the first quarter of 2015. The slowdown in productivity is in line with a moderation in gross domestic product growth for that period. 
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the July-September period after a robust 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, productivity increased at a rate of 1.3 percent.
Hourly compensation jumped at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter after rising at a 1.9 percent pace in the April-June period. Hourly compensation increased at a 2.8 percent rate compared to the third quarter of 2017. 
The rise in compensation mirrors a solid gain in employment costs in the third quarter. The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that annual wage growth recorded its biggest increase in 10 years in the July-September quarter. 
In a third report on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 57.7 last month from 59.8 in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The ISM described demand as ""moderately"" strong, a downgrade from ""robust"" in the previous months. It also said consumption had ""softened, with production and employment continuing to expand, but at lower levels compared to September."" 
According to the ISM, ""supplier labor issues and transportation difficulties continue to disrupt production, but at more manageable levels.""

The ISM's new orders sub-index fell to a reading of 57.4 last month, the lowest reading since April 2017, from 61.8 in September. The survey's factory employment measure dropped to 56.8 in October from 58.8 in the prior month.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the flat reading in construction spending followed an upwardly revised 0.8 percent jump in August. Construction spending in August was previously reported to have gained 0.1 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending nudging up 0.1 percent in September. Construction spending increased 7.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.
The upward revision to August data could have an impact on the government's third-quarter gross domestic product estimate published last Friday. The government estimated the economy grew at a 3.5 percent annualized rate in the July-September period.
In September, spending on private construction projects increased 0.3 percent to a record high after rising 0.4 percent in August. Private construction spending was boosted by increases in both residential and nonresidential outlays.
Investment in private residential projects rebounded 0.6 percent after declining 0.4 percent in August. September's increase came despite weakness in homebuilding amid rising mortgage rates, expensive raw materials as well as land and labor shortages. 
Residential investment contracted in the first nine months of this year, and is one of the risks to the economic expansion that is in its ninth year, the second longest on record. 
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, edged up 0.1 percent in September to an all-time high after surging 1.4 percent in August. 
Spending on public construction projects fell 0.9 percent in September, the largest drop since August 2017, after vaulting 2.2 percent in August. Spending on federal government construction projects tumbled 6.8 percent, the most since June 2017, after soaring 5.3 percent in August.
Investment in state and local government construction projects fell 0.5 percent in September after leaping 2.0 percent in August.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of purchasing managers declined to 57.7 last month from a reading of 59.8 in September.
Analysts had expected the manufacturing PMI to dip to 59.0.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The New Orders Index registered 57.4, a decrease of 4.4 points from the September reading of 61.8.
The Employment Index registered 56.8, a decrease of 2.0 points from the September reading of 58.8.
The Prices Index registered 71.6 in October, a 4.7-point increase from the September level of 66.9.
Commenting on the report, Timothy Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said, "" Overall, the manufacturing community continues to expand, but at the lowest level since April 2018.""

The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the last quarter.
Data for the second quarter was revised slightly up to show productivity rising at 3.0 percent pace instead of the previously reported 2.9 percent rate. Growth in second-quarter productivity was the strongest since the first quarter of 2015.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter productivity advancing at a 2.2 percent rate, following a moderation in gross domestic product growth for that period. The economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the July-September period after a robust 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter.
Compared to the third quarter of 2017, productivity increased at a rate of 1.3 percent. Productivity grew at an average rate of 1.3 percent between 2007 and 2017. That was slower than the 2.7 percent average pace between 2000 and 2007.
Sluggish productivity is one of the constraints to keeping the economy on a path of strong growth on a sustained basis.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rebounded at a 1.2 percent pace in the third quarter. Unit labor costs in the April-June period declined at a 1.0 percent rate, which was the largest drop since the third quarter of 2014. Labor costs increased at a 1.5 percent rate compared to the third quarter of 2017.
Despite moderate growth in labor costs, wage growth is picking up. Hourly compensation jumped at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter after rising at a 1.9 percent pace in the April-June period. Hourly compensation increased at a 2.8 percent rate compared to the third quarter of 2017.

The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ended October 27 decreased by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 from the previous week’s upwardly revised total of 216,000, the U.S. Department of Labor said.
Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 3,000 to 213,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 213,750, an increase of 1,750 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended October 20 fell to 1.631 million from 1.638 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an increase to 1.640 million.

The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to hold rates steady at 0.75%.
""Any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,"" the bank said in its policy summary.
The bank warned that uncertainty over Brexit is weighing on the economy.
“The recent intensification of Brexit uncertainty appeared likely to keep business spending subdued in the near term,"" the meeting minutes said.
The bank also indicated that interest rates could rise or fall after Brexit, depending on the nature of the withdrawal from the European Union.
""The MPC judges that the monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction,"" the minutes said.
Inflation, at 2.4% in September, has held above the BoE’s target rate of 2.0% since January of 2017, but concern over the lack of progress in Brexit negotiations has made the central bank reluctant to move forward with more aggressive tightening.
With less than five months until Britain leaves the European Union, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels, as Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party remains split on how close the country should remain to the bloc.
Most economists think the British central bank will wait until May 2019 to raise rates again, assuming the UK leaves the EU with a deal.

The latest deficit figure was close to the 7.36 billion riyals recorded in the second quarter.
""The improvement in fiscal performance is reflected by the decrease in the deficit with positive oil and non-oil growth, compared to the same period in 2017, and the planned budget,"" Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private sector payrolls increased by the most in eight months in October, suggesting overall job growth accelerated this month after Hurricane Florence weighed on restaurant and retail employment in September.
The strong jobs market is gradually putting upward pressure on compensation, with other data on Wednesday showing a solid increase in labor costs in the third quarter. Labor market strength is expected to underpin economic growth despite weak housing, slowing business investment and stock market turmoil.
""The economy is in great shape with lots of jobs and more money in workers' paychecks and this should help bolster the outlook as the financial markets stumble,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) national employment report showed private sector employment rose by 227,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain since February and beating economists' expectations for an increase of 189,000. September's payrolls count was revised down to 218,000 from 230,000.
The ADP report is jointly produced with Moody's Analytics. It was published ahead of the release of the government's more comprehensive October employment report on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rebounded by 190,000 jobs in October after Florence depressed restaurant and retail payrolls in September.
But acceleration in employment growth likely was tempered by Hurricane Michael, which struck Florida in mid-October. Payrolls increased by 134,000 in September, the fewest in a year. 
""The strength in the ADP report supports our view that the underlying trend in the labor market remains upbeat,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a near 49-year low of 3.7 percent in October. The ADP report showed manufacturing payrolls increased by 17,000 positions last month while construction also gained 17,000 more jobs.
There were also strong increases in professional and business, education and health, and leisure and hospitality payrolls, as well as trade, transportation and utilities. 
The dollar rose to a 16-month high against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street rallied, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on track to post their first two-day gain this month.
BROAD WAGE GAINS
Separately on Wednesday, the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index report showed wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, jumped 0.9 percent in the third quarter after climbing 0.5 percent in the prior period. 
That pushed the annual increase in wages and salaries to 2.9 percent, the biggest gain since September 2008, from 2.8 percent in the year to June. Wage growth was boosted by a surge in transportation and warehousing, likely reflecting a shortage of truck drivers. There were also gains in other industries, including information, healthcare and leisure and hospitality.
""Broadening wage pressures across industry groups and across the pay scale are helping to drive sustained gains in wages for workers,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
The jobs market is viewed as being close to or at full employment. There are a record 7.1 million job openings in the economy. Rising wages should help support consumer spending and soften the hit to the economy from a softening housing market and stalling business investment.
The surge in wages lifted the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, which increased 0.8 percent in the third quarter after rising 0.6 percent in the second quarter. The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. 
The Federal Reserve increased interest rates in September for the third time this year and removed a reference to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative"" from its policy statement. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates again in December.
Private sector wages and salaries rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter after increasing 0.6 percent in the prior period. They were up 3.1 percent in the 12 months through September, the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2008. That followed a 2.9 percent gain in the year to June. 
State and local government wages increased 0.9 percent after advancing 0.5 percent in the second quarter.

But benefits for all workers increased only 0.4 percent in the July-September quarter after rising 0.9 percent in the second quarter. They were up 2.6 percent in the 12 months through September after rising 2.9 percent in the year to June.

The result was above economists’ expectations for a flat reading.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation rise vindicates ECB stimulus curb,"By Jan Strupczewski and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation accelerated last month, providing further rationale for the European Central Bank's decision to dial back stimulus even as growth is slowing more sharply than most had forecast.
Consumer price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro picked up to 2.2 percent in October from 2.1 percent last month, Eurostat said in a preliminary report, holding above the ECB's target of just below 2 percent for the fifth month running.
Having unleashed unprecedented stimulus over the past four years, the ECB is now slowly clawing back support, satisfied that inflation is moving back to target, even if higher oil prices are accounting for much of the recent rise.
Even underlying inflation picked up finally, a comforting sign for the bank as it has argued for months that rising wages and record high employment are bound eventually to push core prices higher, even if with a significant lag.
Indeed, inflation excluding food and fuel prices rose to 1.3 percent from 1.1 percent, slightly beating expectations. An even more narrow measure watched by market analysts, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent.
But the ECB's plan to raise interest rates late next year may be challenged by alarmingly slow growth, which risked putting downward pressure on inflation and putting the ECB's credibility on the line as it has missed its annual inflation target for five years.
Preliminary figures put third quarter growth at 0.2 percent, half of the ECB's own expectation and the previous quarter's figure.
For now the bank is playing down the steady stream of weak economic readings with ECB chief Mario Draghi calling it a slowdown rather than a downturn. He added that even when its asset buys end, policy will be exceptionally loose with rates still at record lows.
Still, economists say much will depend on whether growth can rebound in the last three months of the year as the third quarter's level was below what is considered the bloc's natural or potential rate.
Growth below potential would suggest that it stops absorbing spare capacity and inflation pressures will not be generated at the rate now expected. That is a problem as the ECB sees inflation only at 1.7 percent through 2020, a figure it argues still falls short of its mandate.
In separate data, Eurostat said euro zone unemployment in September was flat at 8.1 percent of the workforce with 13.153 million people without jobs, marginally up from 13.151 million in August.
The jobless rate has been falling steadily for years and has been holding steady at its lowest level since the euro zone's debt crisis.
The ECB plans to end its bond purchases at the end of the year and guides markets for steady interest rates ""through"" next summer.

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said its consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 2.2% in October, accelerating from 2.1% in September. Analysts had expected a reading of 2.1%.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, picked up to 1.1% yea-on-year from 0.9% in the previous month, above expectations for a gain of 1.0%.
Last week the ECB made no changes to its monetary policy, confirming that its €15 billion ($17.1 billion) in monthly asset purchases was still on track until the end of December, but maintained wording suggesting that it only “anticipates” the program to end at that time, leaving itself wiggle room in case of any surprises.
ECB President Mario Draghi emphasized that despite global uncertainties surrounding the U.S.-China trade dispute, Brexit negotiations between the UK and the European Union or Italy’s 2019 budget, he was confident that inflation was on track to reach the ECB’s target of below, but close to, 2%.
In any case, the ECB president made clear that policymakers had not discussed future steps, promising to do so at the next meeting (Dec. 13) when they have updated economic projections.
At the same time, another report showed that the unemployment rate in the euro zone remained steady at 8.1% in September."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices stayed tepid last quarter while core inflation - a measure closely followed by the central bank - dipped, knocking the local dollar and cementing expectation any hike in interest rates is still some way off.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Wednesday showed the headline consumer price index rose 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter in the September quarter, in-line with forecasts.
Annual CPI inflation crawled at 1.9 percent, again in-line with forecasts but below the 2.1 percent pace in the second quarter. Key measures of underlying inflation favored by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) averaged around 1.75 percent for the year, lagging forecasts of 1.9 percent.
The underwhelming data sent the Aussie down more than a quarter of a U.S. cent to $0.7085. It had hit a one-week top of $0.7122 on Tuesday amid an overnight rally in risk assets.
Core inflation has now undershot the RBA's long-term target band of 2 percent to 3 percent for the 11th quarter on the trot, the longest run of misses on record.
The RBA had already flagged consumer prices will remain depressed toward the end of the year before picking up next year. It, however, does not see the core measure hopping back to the mid-point of its target throughout December 2020.
The RBA will publish fresh forecasts for economic growth and inflation next Friday.
""The weaker-than-expected Q3 figures won't scare the RBA too much, but they look more like a nasty Halloween trick than a treat,"" said Paul Dales, Sydney-based economist at Capital Economics.
""Overall, these figures support our view that underlying inflation will stay below the RBA’s target for at least another two years. As such, we doubt the RBA will raise rates from 1.5 percent until late in 2020.""
A major headwind for consumer prices has been lukewarm wages growth, which is running near historic lows even as employment has boomed. Stiff competition in the country's retail sector and historically low rental growth have also weighed on inflation.
As a result, the RBA has kept interest rates at an all-time low of 1.5 percent since August 2016.
Interest rate futures do not fully price in a hike to 1.75 percent until March 2020.
NO PRICE PRESSURE
Prices for travel and accommodation, tobacco, petrol and transport saw solid increases but at a headline level this was offset by a sharp fall in child care costs, crimped by a government subsidy in July.
The ABS reported a small acceleration in inflation in tradable prices - goods that are most affected by international competition - which rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter.
In contrast, prices of non-tradables or domestic-driven inflation which mainly cover services crawled at 0.3 percent.
""There are no signs of any near-term significant price pressures in Australia,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.he added.
""We remain of the view that the RBA won’t raise interest rates until late 2020... and the next move being a rate cut cannot be ruled out.""

But the BOJ issued a slightly stronger warning on financial vulnerabilities than it did three months ago, reflecting growing concerns that years of ultra-low rates were hurting bank profits and could discourage them from increasing lending.
""Prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits from low interest rates... could destabilize the financial system,"" the BOJ said in a quarterly report assessing the long-term economic outlook and risks.
""Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it's necessary to pay close attention to future developments,"" it said. In the previous report in July, the BOJ only said such risks were not materializing.
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and long-term rates around zero percent by a 7-2 vote.
Caught between heightening external risks to growth and the mounting demerits of prolonged easing, the BOJ is set to keep policy steady for some time, analysts say.
""If it weren't for the trade friction, the BOJ would be looking for ways to normalize policy. Normalization is off the cards for now,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""There is no need to ease policy, but at the same time the BOJ can't normalize policy due to worries about trade and the chance the yen will rise.""
In the quarterly report, the central bank cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the current fiscal year ending March 2019 to 0.9 percent from 1.1 percent three months ago.
It also slightly trimmed its price forecasts for the following two years and now projects inflation to hit 1.5 percent in the year ending in March 2021 - short of its 2 percent target.
""The downgrade to the BOJ's inflation forecasts underlines that policy tightening remains a long way off,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""If anything, the board has become more pessimistic about the prospects of hitting its 2 percent inflation target.""
Inflation has remained subdued despite Japan's steady economic expansion, forcing the BOJ to maintain stimulus despite the impact on bank profits from years of near-zero rates.
The central bank took steps in July to make its policy framework more sustainable, such as allowing bond yields to move more flexibly around its target.
But the measures have done little to revive bond market trading or give relief to banks. In a semi-annual review of Japan's banking system, the BOJ warned that risk-taking in Japan's financial sector hit a near three-decade high as they struggle to earn profits.
Adding to headwinds for meeting the BOJ's price target, a recent batch of weak data suggests Japan's economy may have peaked. Many analysts warn that intensifying trade frictions and slowing Chinese demand could weigh on business sentiment and discourage firms from boosting spending.
Japanese factory output fell more than expected in September as a series of typhoons and earthquakes disrupted production, data released earlier on Wednesday showed, reinforcing expectations the economy may have contracted slightly in the third quarter.

822,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 12:48AM ET</span>",China Reports Weaker-than-expected PMI Data in October,"Investing.com - China’s manufacturing sector expanded at a slower pace in October, the latest survey from the National Bureau of Statistic showed on Wednesday.
The country’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 50.2 in October from 50.8 in September, weaker than forecasts of 50.6.
The non-manufacturing PMI also slipped to 53.9, missing forecasts for 54.6 and down from 54.9 in September.
On September 24, the U.S. and China slapped additional tariffs on each other's goods. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hit China with more duties by December.
""All the numbers from China's PMI release today confirm a broad-based decline in economic activity,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for China at ANZ in a client note.
""Besides an expected reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut next January, we expect future supportive policy actions to be measured. The government's priority is to avoid a financial blow-up,” Yeung added.
Private surveys by Caixin and IHS Markit focusing on small and mid-sized firms will be released on Thursday.

823,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 12:25AM ET</span>","China factory growth weakest in over two years, slump in export orders deepens","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector in October expanded at its weakest pace in over two years, hurt by slowing domestic and external demand, in a sign of deepening cracks in the economy from an intensifying trade war with the United States.
Anxiety about China's cooling growth and its likely drag on the global economy have vexed financial markets recently, and Wednesday's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) indicates more stress for investors through coming months.
The official PMI - which gives global investors their first look at business conditions in China at the start of the last quarter of the year - fell to 50.2 in October, the lowest since July 2016 and down from 50.8 in September.
It was a touch above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for a 27th straight month, but undershot the 50.6 forecast in a Reuters poll.
The latest reading suggests a further loss of momentum in the world's second-biggest economy, and the deteriorating environment for businesses could prompt more policy support from Beijing on top of a raft of recent initiatives.
""All the numbers from China's PMI release today confirm a broad-based decline in economic activity,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for China at ANZ in a client note, adding that conditions for the private sector is ""much worse"" than headline data suggested.
""Besides an expected reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut next January, we expect future supportive policy actions to be measured. The government's priority is to avoid a financial blow-up.""
New export orders, an indicator of future activity, contracted for a fifth straight month and at the fastest pace in at least a year. The sub-index fell to 46.9 from 48.0 in September.
While China's exports have been pretty resilient largely as firms front-loaded shipments to dodge stiffer U.S. duties, analysts see pressure building in coming months. The continued slump in export orders may be bearing that scenario out.
October is the first full month after the latest U.S. tariffs went into effect. Washington and Beijing slapped additional tariffs on each other's goods on Sept. 24, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to hit China with more duties.
If the United States follows through on its promise to increase its tariffs to 25 percent at the turn of the year, exporters will feel more pain.
""The 25 percent tariff rate will be activated in January...maybe the weakening of new export orders in the PMI is a warning sign of what's to come even though it hasn't been reflected yet in the hard data,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics.
Global policy makers remain anxious about the wider fallout of the U.S.-led protectionist policies.
Japan on Wednesday reported weak industrial output for September partly as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute weighed on its exports, while South Korea's factory output for last month shrank the most in over 1-1/2 years.
BIGGER STIMULUS?
The China PMI survey also showed the production sub-index fell to 52 in October from 53.0 in September, while a new orders saw a sharp decline to 50.8 from 52.0, in a sign of much weaker domestic demand.
The statistics bureau attributed the slump in October's manufacturing activity to the impact from a week-long national holiday and the challenging external environment.
More than 70 percent of U.S. firms operating in southern China are considering delaying further investment there and moving some or all of their manufacturing to other countries as the trade war bites into profits, a business survey showed on Monday.
China's economy grew at its weakest pace since the global financial crisis in the third quarter, as manufacturing output and infrastructure investment slowed. Analysts believe business conditions will get worse before getting better.
Firms are already facing pressure on earnings. A survey over the weekend showed profit growth at the country's industrial powerhouses cooled for the fifth consecutive month in September on the back of a greater slowdown in production and sales.
China's manufacturing sector has been squeezed by a reduction in sources of credit amid Beijing's multi-year crackdown on corporate debt and risky lending practices, with smaller firms especially under strain.
Policymakers have already shifted their priorities to reducing risks to growth. Earlier this month China's central bank announced the fourth reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut for this year, and is expected to ease monetary policy further.
It is also stepping up moves to lower financing costs and pledged more support to private firms, a key source of jobs. On the fiscal side the government is stepping up stimulus through infrastructure projects, and has also pledged more tax cuts next year to support growth.
Another sister survey released by the NBS on Wednesday showed growth in China's vast services industry cooled in October.
However, a sub-index of construction activity improved in an indication that the government's infrastructure push may be taking hold, analysts say.
All the same, some economists believe Beijing might have to sharply boost stimulus soon.
""Beijing's policy focus so far has been on containing a credit freeze,"" Nomura analysts said.
""If our more cautious views prove to be valid, growth will likely slow to such a worrying pace in spring 2019 that Beijing may have to greatly ramp-up its easing/stimulus measures at that time.""

824,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 09:40PM ET</span>",China Feels Trade War Pain as Export Gauge Signals Worse to Come,"(Bloomberg) -- An official gauge of activity in China’s manufacturing sector worsened in October as the effects of an ongoing trade war with the U.S. hit home.
The manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 50.2 this month from 50.8 in September, missing the median prediction of 50.6 in a Bloomberg survey of forecasters. A gauge of new orders for export fell further into contraction territory, to 46.9, the lowest reading since early 2016.
The majority of sub-indices declined. A level of 50 marks the dividing line between expansion and contraction.
The non-manufacturing PMI, which reflects activity in the construction and services sectors, also worsened to 53.9 from September’s 54.9 reading. The service-sector component dropped 1.3 points to 52.1, the lowest level since mid-2016, while the construction component rose to 63.9, matching the December 2017 record high.
The government this month introduced a raft of measures to stabilize sentiment, adding to steps to boost liquidity in the financial system, tax deductions for households and targeted measures aimed at helping exporters. Those measures have yet to have much effect, and in particular the export orders gauge signals that the economy will see more downward pressure in the months to come.
Top officials including President Xi Jinping also sought to bolster investor confidence, commenting on the fundamental strength of the economy and attempting to talk up the stock market, which has fallen 9 percent this month.
Those attempts have yet to prove successful, according to a set of early indicators compiled by Bloomberg Economics, which had suggested that sentiment among executives and investors continued to deteriorate in October.
On Tuesday, China’s currency slid to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in more than a decade following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to expand tariffs to cover the full range of imports from China if he is unable to extract concessions from Xi during a Group of 20 summit of world leaders in Argentina at the end of November.
“China-U.S. trade tensions have impacted some industries,” said Wen Tao, an analyst with China Logistics Information Center, which releases the PMI data. “Looking ahead, with the environment cleanup campaign in winter set to kick in, and no positive shift in China U.S. trade frictions, domestic demand will be relatively stable in November, but external demand will continue to decline,” Wen said in a statement on the organization’s website.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Japan October industrial output falls as trade friction weighs,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output fell more than expected in September as a series of typhoons and earthquakes disrupted production and a trade war between the United States and China weighed on exports, clouding the country's economic outlook.
The 1.1 percent decline in output was more than the median estimate for a 0.3 percent decline and follows a 0.2 percent increase in the previous month.
Japan exports a large volumes of electronic parts and equipment to China, which are used to make goods destined for the United States, so Japan's economic growth could weaken if Washington and Beijing remain at loggerheads over trade.
Output fell in September due to a 2.5 percent decline in production of cars and car parts, data from the trade ministry showed on Wednesday. Production of robots and machines used to make flat panel displays also fell 1.4 percent.
Inventories of electronic parts, which are used in smart phones, jumped 9.6 percent in September, the fastest increase in six months.
Economists have expressed concern that high inventories of electronic parts are a sign of weak demand, which could cause manufacturers of such goods to cut future production.
Manufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expect output to rise 6.0 percent in October but decline 0.8 percent in November.
These forecasts are in doubt after exports fell in September for the first time since 2016 as shipments to the United States and China declined, likely impeding third quarter economic growth and adding to concerns about the broadening impact of an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war.
U.S. President Donald Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports into the United States, which exceed $257 billion, if Beijing fails to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to Chinese trade, technology transfer and industrial subsidy policies.
Trump has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods.
The Bank of Japan is set to keep monetary policy steady next week and maintain its optimistic view on the economic outlook, even as global trade frictions, growth worries and volatile markets put it further away from achieving its elusive inflation target.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 12:57PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence at 18-year high; house price gains slow,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high in October, driven largely by a robust labor market, bolstering expectations that strong economic growth would continue through early 2019. 
But a weakening housing market and tightening financial market conditions are casting a shadow on the economic expansion that is in its ninth year, the second longest on record. Home price gains slowed further in August, other data showed, another sign that higher mortgage rates were weighing on housing demand.
""We don't know how long this is going to hold up, but the consumer is bullish on the outlook and this means the economy is going to continue to advance in this long economic expansion from the last recession,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index reading rose to 137.9 this month, the highest since September 2000, from a downwardly revised 135.3 in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer index slipping to 136.0 from the previously reported 138.4 in September.
Consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions improved despite a sharp stock market sell-off and jump in U.S. Treasury yields, which have tightened financial market conditions. The stock market's S&P 500 index has dropped more than 8 percent this month.
The Conference Board survey puts more emphasis on the labor market. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents saying jobs are scarce or plentiful, was the most favorable since January 2001.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. Economists said it raised the possibility that the unemployment rate could drop further from a near 49-year low of 3.7 percent. The government will publish its October employment report on Friday.
""At the end of the day, it is the job market, or the security of having a job with a regular paycheck, that supports confidence and spending,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""So far, so good.""
Consumer confidence at multi-year highs bodes well for spending in the upcoming holiday season. More consumers planned to buy automobiles and houses over the next six months, but the share of those intending to purchase major appliances slipped.
The dollar was near a 2 1/2-month high against a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street were higher. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
HOUSING DEMAND SOFTENING
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent annualized rate in the third quarter and is considered on course to achieve the Trump administration's target of 3.0 percent annual growth this year. 
Growth has been spurred by a $1.5 trillion tax cut. Economists estimate the tax cut stimulus peaked in the third quarter and expect growth to gradually slow from the second half 2019, restrained in part by higher interest rates. 
The Federal Reserve has increased borrowing costs three times this year and in September removed a reference to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative"" from its policy statement. The U.S. central bank is expected raise rates gain in December.
Higher borrowing costs have cooled housing demand; sales and homebuilding declined in September.
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 U.S. metropolitan areas rose 5.5 percent in August from a year ago after increasing 5.9 percent in July. Growth in house prices has slowed from as high as 6.8 percent in March. Prices had been boosted by a shortage of properties on the market, but now mortgage rates have risen to seven-year highs.
""The sharp gain in mortgage rates thus far in 2018 continues to weigh on home sales as well as home prices,"" said Brent Campbell, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""With the Fed continuing to tighten monetary policy through the rest of 2018 and into 2019, mortgage rates are likely to rise even more, resulting in less housing demand and modest house price growth in 2019.""

828,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Mexican economy recovers in third quarter as trade worries fade,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy rebounded in the third quarter, official data showed on Tuesday, helped by stronger industrial output and a jump in services that reflected a surge in consumer confidence in the wake of elections.
The economy grew 0.9 percent in seasonally adjusted terms in the third quarter, bouncing back from a 0.2 percent contraction in the previous three-month period, according to a preliminary estimate from national statistics agency INEGI.
Growth in services was supported by the biggest jump in consumer confidence on record after the landslide victory of leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in July's presidential election. 
Industrial output picked up from a slump in the wake of a new trade deal with the United States.
Analysts are divided on the outlook ahead. Some think spending projects by Lopez Obrador could lift growth next year, but others fear uncertainty around his economic policies could paralyze investment.
Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, the economy grew by 2.6 percent in unadjusted terms, INEGI said.
In late August, Mexican negotiators agreed to an updated North American trade deal with the United States, with Canada joining the accord a month later. 
While the deal must still be ratified in all three countries, the accord helped calm investor uncertainty after months of often contentious talks.
Analysts noted the United States, the destination for around 80 percent of Mexican exports, had stronger-than-expected growth in the third quarter. 
Analysts at Capital Economics said lower inflation, which has been easing from a more than 16-year high, and increased spending under Lopez Obrador should boost growth next year. 
The incoming president has pledged to roll out cash transfer programs to the young and elderly and ramp up building projects, including a new oil refinery.
But Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said there was ""rising market apprehension"" about what policy direction Lopez Obrador will take once he assumes office on Dec. 1 that could make national businesses ""more defensive in their spending and investment decisions.""

On Monday, Lopez Obrador said he would cancel a new airport backed by the country's business elite, sparking the biggest slump in local financial markets since the surprise election of U.S. President Donald Trump.

829,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 10:08AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises to Highest Level in 18 Years,"Investing.com - Confidence among U.S consumers rose in October, marking its highest level in 18 years, according to data released on Tuesday.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence increased to 137.9 this month, compared to a reading of 136.00 forecast by economists. That was its highest level since September 2000.
The measure had climbed to 135.3 in the previous month, despite a downward revision from an initial 138.4
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
The Present Situation Index improved from 169.4 to 172.8, while the Expectations Index increased from 112.5 last month to 114.6 this month.
The cutoff date for the preliminary results was October 18.
Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, indicated that consumers’ assessment of present-day conditions remained quite positive and attributed that perception primarily to strong employment growth.
“The Expectations Index posted another gain in October, suggesting that consumers do not foresee the economy losing steam anytime soon,” she said. “Rather, they expect the strong pace of growth to carry over into early 2019.”"
830,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Strong German inflation backs Draghi's plan to exit stimulus,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German annual inflation picked up in October to reach its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years, data showed on Tuesday, supporting European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's case for gradually winding down his unprecedented monetary stimulus.
German consumer prices, harmonized to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.4 percent year-on-year after an increase of 2.2 percent in the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said.
That was the highest reading since February 2012 and in line with market expectations. The ECB targets inflation of close to but below 2 percent for the single-currency bloc as a whole.
On a non-harmonized basis, consumer price inflation even hit a 10-year high at 2.5 percent, the data showed.
Price pressures picked up on a broad basis, suggesting that the rise was also driven by core inflation and not only by the more volatile energy and food components. Germany's preliminary inflation data do not include a figure for core inflation.
With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB last week confirmed its plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) bond-buying program at the end of this year and raise interest rates for the first time since 2011 sometime after next summer.
The euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data for October on Wednesday, with the headline figure expected to pick up to 2.2 percent after 2.1 percent in September.
The inflation figures chimed with data released earlier on Tuesday that showed Germany's jobless total fell in October and employment hit a record high in September, underlining the strength of a labor market that is supporting a consumer-led upswing in Europe's largest economy.

Eurostat said the euro area economy grew by just 0.2% in the third quarter, halving from 0.4% in the previous quarter. Economists had been expecting growth of 0.4%.
The economy expanded by an annualized 1.7% in the three months to September, slowing from a upwardly revised 2.2% in the second quarter, missing forecasts of 1.9%.
Separate reports earlier showed that the French economy accelerated in the third quarter, but growth in Italy stalled.
French GDP rose by 0.4%, boosted by increased consumer spending and business investment, up from 0.2% in the previous quarter.
But Italy’s GDP was flat compared to the second quarter, disappointing expectations for growth of 0.2%.
The stagnation in growth comes against a background of an ongoing row between Brussels and Rome over the Italian government’s budget plans.
Last week the European Commission rejected Rome’s 2019 draft budget, which would raise the country’s deficit, saying it flouted a previous commitment to lower the deficit.
Italy’s government was given three weeks to resubmit a budget proposal, but the government has pledged to stick to its spending plans."
832,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 05:43AM ET</span>","German jobless total falls, employment hits record high","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's jobless total fell in October and employment hit a record high in September, data showed on Tuesday, underlining the strength of a labor market that is supporting a consumer-led upswing in Europe's largest economy.
The Federal Labour Office said the seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 11,000 to 2.292 million, slightly below the predicted drop of 12,000.
The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.1 percent, the lowest since German reunification in 1990.
""Thanks to the continuing boom, the labor market is still in good shape...,"" KfW economist Joerg Zeuner said.
""In some sectors, however, shortages of skilled workers and young recruits are hampering the expansion of production. The care sector and the building trade are particularly affected.""
In a politically risky push to fill a record number of job vacancies and stabilize the public pension system, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition parties earlier this month agreed on a new immigration law to attract more skilled workers from countries outside the European Union.
In a further positive sign, seasonally adjusted employment as measured by the International Labour Organisation climbed by 557,000 on the year to a record of 45.0 million in September, separate Federal Statistics Office data showed.
Household spending has become an important growth driver in Germany as record-high employment, increased job security, above-inflation pay hikes and low borrowing costs all help open shoppers' wallets.

A survey last week showed that German shoppers look keen to spend in November, but their expectations for the economy and their own personal income have slipped on worries about international trade conflicts and Brexit.

833,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending solid; income gain smallest in 15 months,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose for a seventh straight month in September, but income recorded its smallest gain in more than a year on moderate wage growth, suggesting the current pace of spending was unlikely to be sustained. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Monday also showed the increase in income at the disposal of households was the smallest in 15 months and savings dropped to their lowest level since December last year. 
There are signs the stimulus from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package has peaked. Higher interest rates and falling household wealth after a sharp stock market selloff are also casting a shadow on spending.
""It remains to be seen how long the spending spree can continue,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics in Los Angeles. ""The stimulus from the tax cut has plateaued. Rising interest rates and volatile stock markets are having a psychological as well as a real effect.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4 percent last month as households bought more motor vehicles and spent more on health care. Data for August was revised up to show spending advancing 0.5 percent instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.4 percent in September. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3 percent. The so-called real consumer spending climbed 0.4 percent in August.
The data was included in last Friday's third-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending accelerating at a 4.0 percent annualized rate, the fastest in nearly four years.
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter, a slowdown from the April-June period's robust 4.2 percent pace.
The dollar (DXY) was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose, recouping some of last week's sharp losses. 
INFLATION RISING STEADILY 
The rise in real consumer spending in September set it on a solid growth path heading into the fourth quarter. Economists expect consumer spending to slow in the first half of 2019.
Personal income rose 0.2 percent last month, the smallest increase since June 2017, after gaining 0.4 percent in August. Disposable income also increased 0.2 percent. Wages climbed 0.2 percent after jumping 0.5 percent in August. 
Wage growth remains gradual despite the unemployment rate being near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent. The saving rate fell to $975.7 billion last month, the lowest level since December 2017, from $1.0 trillion in August.
Economists believe the stimulus from the tax cuts peaked in the third quarter. The stock market's S&P 500 index (SPX) has dropped nearly 8 percent this month.
For now, the fundamentals for consumer spending are strong, with consumer confidence at multi-year highs.
""We expect consumption growth to moderate in first half of 2019 as the boost from the tax cuts fades, but in the near term favorable fundamentals are likely to translate into another strong holiday shopping season,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York.
In September, spending on goods surged 0.6 percent. Consumers also spent more on sporting goods. Outlays on services gained 0.3 percent, with spending on health care offsetting a decrease in spending at restaurants and on accommodation. 
Prices continued to rise steadily in September. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2 percent after being flat in August. 
That left the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 2.0 percent for a fifth straight month. 
The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.
The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again in December despite tightening financial market conditions brought about by the stock market drop and a rise in U.S. Treasury yields. The central bank raised rates in September for the third time this year and removed a reference to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative"" from its policy statement.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",China factory growth seen cooling further as U.S. tariff impact mounts: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's factory sector likely cooled further in October as domestic demand faltered and exporters felt a bigger sting from an intensifying trade war with the United States, a Reuters poll showed.
    The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to have slipped to 50.6, the lowest since February and down from 50.8 in September, according to the median forecast of 34 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
    Separately, a private survey on China's manufacturing sector is forecast to show activity contracted for the first time since May 2017, though the decline may be marginal.
    Such downbeat readings would signal a further loss of momentum in the world's second-largest economy, adding to worries about risks to global growth, and would likely prompt Beijing to launch more support and stimulus measures on top of a raft of initiatives in recent months.
The economy grew by a slower-than-expected 6.5 percent in the third quarter, its weakest pace since the global financial crisis, and analysts believe business conditions will get worse before they get better.
    October is the first full month after the latest U.S. tariffs went into effect. Washington and Beijing slapped additional tariffs on each other's goods on Sept. 24. 
    If the United States follows through on its promise to increase its tariffs to 25 percent at the turn of the year, exporters will feel more pain, Chinese businesspeople say. 
    ""Export orders that I received from October's Canton Fair have been down drastically,"" Lu Junwen, general manager at a battery maker in Shenzhen, told Reuters. The Canton Fair, held twice a year, is China's biggest trade fair.
    ""Next year is going to be hard,"" Lu said. 
    More than 70 percent of U.S. firms operating in southern China are considering delaying further investment there and moving some or all of their manufacturing to other countries as the trade war bites into profits, a business survey showed on Monday.
Such a scenario would complicate Beijing's efforts to lift 
fixed-asset investment growth from record lows and raise the specter of major layoffs which would weigh further on consumption.
    Earlier this month, the central bank cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the fourth time this year, stepping up moves to lower financing costs and pledged more support to private firms, a key source of jobs.
Beijing has also urged banks to continue lending to struggling firms, especially smaller companies, though rising defaults are making lenders cautious about extending credit to businesses without state backing.
Economists expect Beijing will roll out more support measures in coming months, with more cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratio expected next year, a Reuters poll showed this month.
Hefty tax cuts also look to be on the cards, though that would only ease pressure on firms' bottom lines and could not compensate for slowing sales.
    ""We expect the Chinese government to continue to roll out stimulus measures that match the weakness in the economy. This should help ensure a soft landing next year,"" economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a client note on Friday.
    They expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to 6.1 percent next year. The Chinese government has maintained it can still meet its growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, slowing from 6.9 percent in 2017. 
    The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, is expected to have dipped slightly to 49.9 from 50.0 in September, putting it a whisker within contraction territory. 

    The official PMI survey is due out on Oct. 31, along with a similar official survey on services. The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will come out on Nov. 1 and its services PMI will be published on Nov. 5.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 09:48PM ET</span>","Japan retail sales growth slows, likely a drag on third quarter GDP","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose for an 11th consecutive month in September from a year earlier but the pace of gains slowed from the prior month, in a sign private consumption may not be strong enough to avoid a broader slowdown in economic growth.
The trade ministry's figures followed data that showed an unexpected drop in exports in September, raising the specter of a marked moderation in economic growth in July-September from the previous quarter's solid expansion.
Analysts expect the third-quarter slowdown to be temporary, caused by a string of natural disasters that disrupted business and consumer activity in recent months.
But the softer growth will add to wider concerns about the central bank's ability to hit its elusive annual inflation target of 2 percent.
The Bank of Japan will examine the data and coming indicators such as factory output and jobless figures at its board meeting this week, when it updates its growth and inflation projections. The data feeds into calculations for gross domestic product (GDP) for July-September, which is due out on Nov. 14.
""The third-quarter GDP likely contracted 0.1 percent as a reaction to the previous quarter's solid growth,"" said Azusa Kato, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities.
""The BOJ will probably trim growth and inflation projections slightly for the current fiscal year, but it won't move for the foreseeable future.""
September's 2.1 percent annual increase in retail sales beat the Reuters poll median forecast for 1.6 percent, trade ministry data showed on Monday, but it was slower than the 2.7 percent expansion in August.
September's gains were led by rising gasoline prices and brisk sales of machine tools, food and beverage purchases and clothing, while car sales slipped and online retailers suffered a decline.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales fell 0.2 percent in September from the previous month, following August's 0.9 percent increase.
Private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of economic activity, is key to the central bank's efforts to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target.
However, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it will take longer than initially expected to achieve that target.
Japan's economy grew an annualized 3.0 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2016, led by solid household and business spending, but risks from global trade tension cloud the outlook for export-reliant Japan.
The BOJ is widely expected to keep a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and long-term rates around zero percent at a two-day rate review ending on Wednesday.
Japan's annual core consumer inflation rose 1.0 percent in September, the fastest in seven months, although this was boosted mostly by higher oil prices, underscoring the challenge of fostering sustainable price growth.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",China's industrial profits growth slows for fifth month as orders wane,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September as sales of raw materials and manufactured goods further ebbed, pointing to cooling domestic demand in the world's second-biggest economy. 
The slowdown was in line with data last week that showed September's factory output grew at the weakest pace since February 2016. 
Slowing corporate profits will put pressure on jobs, ultimately tapping the brakes on household consumption and hurting China's overall growth.
Industrial profits rose 4.1 percent in September from a year earlier to 545.5 billion yuan ($78.57 billion), the National Statistics Bureau (NBS) said on Saturday. That was less than half of the pace in August, and the slowest since March. 
Earnings in September were mainly pressured by a greater slowdown in production and sales, declining price growth, as well as a high statistical base a year earlier, He Ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
An escalating trade war with the United States has also added to the pressure on overall output, and threatens to chill business investments and earnings growth in the months ahead. 
Data last week showed the Chinese economy in the third quarter grew at the weakest pace since the global financial crisis as manufacturing output slowed.
The manufacturing sector has also been squeezed by a reduction in sources of credit amid Beijing's multi-year crackdown on corporate debt and risky lending practices. 
While authorities are taking steps to ease pressure on firms with liquidity issues, many companies still face difficulty in obtaining funding. Interest rates on loans have also risen due to the reduced supply of credit.
A cooling property market - an engine of economic growth - has also sapped demand for construction-related goods and services, curbing industrial profits. 
Softer infrastructure investment despite Beijing approving more projects in the second half this year has also added pressure on the bottom-lines of industrial firms. 
In the first nine months of the year, industrial profits increased 14.7 percent, driven by earnings of companies producing steel, building materials, oil and petrochemicals. 
But the growth slowed from the 16.2 percent pace seen in January-August. 
Earlier this month, Jiangsu Shagang Co Ltd (SZ:002075), the listed arm of China's biggest privately owned steel mill Shagang Group, reported a 91.5 percent increase in net profit for the third quarter. 
The average profit margin for steel remains very high, according to analyst at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong.
Industrial firms' liabilities rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier by the end of September to 63.1 trillion yuan, compared with an increase of 6.6 percent by end-August. 
The statistics bureau's data covers large companies with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

838,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 02:14PM ET</span>",U.S. economic growth slows slightly in third quarter; outlook less upbeat,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years, keeping growth on track to hit the Trump administration's 3 percent target this year.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annualized rate also supported by a surge in inventory investment and solid government spending, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its first estimate of third-quarter GDP growth. 
While that was a slowdown from a 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter, it still exceeded the economy's growth potential, which economists put at about 2 percent. But there were red flags to the economic expansion that is now in its ninth year and the second longest on record. 
Business spending stalled and residential investment declined for a third straight quarter, signs that the boost from a $1.5 trillion tax cut was fading and higher interest rates were hurting the housing market.
""There will come a day of reckoning for the economy after the tax cut monies are all gone, but for today Washington really has something to crow about,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP expanding at a 3.3 percent pace in the third quarter. The fiscal stimulus is part of measures adopted by President Donald Trump's administration to boost annual growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis. 
Yet the government is also locked in a bitter trade war with China as well as trade disputes with other trade partners and the last quarter's slowdown mostly reflected the impact of Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, including soybeans.
Farmers front-loaded shipments to China before the tariffs took effect in early July, boosting second-quarter growth. Since then, soybean exports have declined every month, increasing the trade deficit. There were also decreases in exports of petroleum and nonautomative capital goods. 
Strong domestic demand, however, sucked in imports of consumer goods and motor vehicles. The widening trade gap chopped off 1.78 percentage points from GDP growth in the third quarter. That was the most since the second quarter of 1985 and reversed the 1.22 percentage points contribution in the April-June period.
The rebound in imports also reflected a rush by businesses to stockpile before U.S. import duties, mostly on Chinese goods, came into effect late in the third quarter. 
Imports subtract from GDP growth. But some of the imports likely ended up in warehouses, adding to the stockpile of inventory, which contributed to GDP.
Inventories increased at a $76.3 billion rate after declining at a $36.8 billion pace in the second quarter. 
As a result, inventory investment added 2.07 percentage points to GDP growth, the biggest contribution since the first quarter of 2015, after slicing off 1.1 percentage points from output in the second quarter.
ROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING
""Trade policy may also have driven the big swings in net exports and inventories,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""This dynamic could continue on into the fourth quarter.""
Excluding the effects of trade and inventories, GDP grew at a 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter compared to a 4.0 percent pace in April-June. 
The dollar briefly rose to a two-month high against a basket of currencies on the data.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after Amazon (O:AMZN) gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast and Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' estimates. U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
Solid third-quarter growth is expected to keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates again in December, despite a recent tightening in financial market conditions brought about by a stock market sell-off and a rise in U.S. Treasury yields. 
The Fed raised rates in September for the third time this year and removed a reference to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative"" from its policy statement. 
The GDP report showed the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.6 percent rate in the third quarter. The core PCE price index rose at a 2.1 percent pace in the April-June period.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 4.0 percent rate in the third quarter. That was the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014 and followed a 3.8 percent pace of increase in the second quarter. 
Momentum is, however, expected to slow as wage growth remains gradual despite the unemployment rate being at a near 49-year low of 3.7 percent. In addition, the stock market turmoil is seen reducing household wealth. 
Business spending on equipment increased at a 0.4 percent rate, the slowest in two years, after rising at a 4.6 percent pace in the second quarter. Businesses are struggling to find workers and the import tariffs are increasing manufacturing costs for companies, such as  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), 3M Co (N:MMM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F). 
""It appears most business leaders have become somewhat cautious about the future and are holding off committing to major investment plans,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The housing market contracted at its steepest pace in more than a year in the third quarter, also dimming the economy's outlook.

U.S. GDP registered a 3.5% advance, beating expectations for 3.3%, on the back of strong consumer spending that contributed 2.7% to the overall economic growth figure.
“But the big question for markets, particularly in light of the recent stock market movements, is whether this is ‘as good as it gets’ for U.S. growth”, ING economists James Smith and Jonas Goltermann commented. 
These experts clarified that there will be no short-term drop in growth as they expect the fourth quarter to be boosted by rebuilding and cleanup efforts from recent Hurricanes Florence and Michael.
However, they warned that they expect that growth to moderate in the coming year. 
“Tighter financial conditions – driven by higher interest rates and the stronger dollar – may start to bite, while persistent trade uncertainties and fading fiscal tailwinds may also begin to restrain activity more noticeably,” they said. 
Despite the warning, these economists made clear that the tight labor market with its positive impact on wage growth would likely continue into next year and they forecast a “decent 2.4% growth reading” for 2019.
“With that in mind, we expect the Federal Reserve to push ahead with its tightening cycle, hiking in December and three more times in 2019,” they concluded."

While President Donald Trump said third-quarter growth would be “outstanding,” economists project the expansion was a bit slower than the prior period, though still strong by recent standards.
GDP probably grew at a 3.3 percent annualized pace after a 4.2 percent gain in the prior quarter, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the strongest back-to-back quarters since 2014, amid boosts from consumer spending, business investment and the restocking of inventories.
Projections range from 2.4 percent to 4.2 percent. Here’s what some forecasters are saying ahead of the Commerce Department data due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington:
Credit Suisse
“Strong consumption and solid business investment continue to underpin growth,” economists led by James Sweeney wrote in a note. “Trade and inventories will continue to be volatile, but will largely offset each other, with a large drag from net exports balanced by a recovery in inventories.”
Business spending should remain solid, while residential investment is likely to decline. “We expect growth to remain above-trend in the medium term, but some of the strength in the past two quarters could prove temporary” as a modest slowdown in consumption and energy investment weigh on growth, he wrote.
Bank of America
“A big story of this quarter is the significant positive payback in inventories,” which are likely to contribute more than 1 percentage point to growth, economists led by Michelle Meyer wrote. Consumer spending growth should remain robust at close to 3.5 percent while equipment and government spending accelerate, though “trade will be a big drag.”
Wells Fargo
The economy should prove healthy, with real consumer spending increasing at a 3.4 percent rate, according to economist Sam Bullard. Tailwinds for the sector include job market strength, rising wages and disposable income growth, and elevated confidence, he wrote in a report.
Still, weakness in exports and a rebound in imports suggest that net exports will “exert significant drag” on overall third-quarter growth, subtracting 1.6 percentage point.
Bloomberg Economics (3.2%)
Economists Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Tim Mahedy raised their forecast from 2.8 percent to reflect “a more positive, sustained impact from changes to tax policy -- which may signal some supply-side benefits from corporate tax cuts -- while at the same time showing a smaller impact on consumer and business demand from trade tensions.”
Demand may remain intact, but “wild swings in net exports and business inventories are likely to be at least as dramatic as they were in the second quarter,” they wrote in a note."

The ECB confirmed a day earlier plans to wind down its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) stimulus program at the end of this year and raise interest rates sometime after next summer because it still sees inflation holding up despite uncertainties around growth.
Its latest Survey of Professional Forecasters on Friday backed up that line of thought, with unchanged expectations for headline inflation for this year and the next two, at 1.7 percent, and in the longer term at 1.9 percent.
But the forecasters polled by the ECB cut their estimates for core inflation, which strips out the more volatile energy and food prices, and economic growth for this year and the next.
""Respondents typically attributed their revisions to external factors such as higher energy prices weighing on disposable income, with many also noting ... some dampening impact on exports and investment due to increased uncertainty surrounding the outlook for world trade,"" the ECB said.
The euro zone's central bank targets a headline inflation rate ""below, but close to 2 percent"" over the medium term.
In its survey, the ECB also noted that growth in core prices was still accelerating, albeit now 10 basis points more slowly at 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent the next.
""The expected pick-up in underlying inflation remained
underpinned by a pick-up in annual growth in compensation per employee, which was expected to increase to 2.3 percent by 2020,"" the central bank said.

Industrial production was seen down 0.3 percent in September from the previous month, the poll of 16 economists shows. The August figure has been revised to a 0.2 percent gain from the 0.7 percent initially reported.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo's core consumer price inflation was unchanged in October from the previous month, government data showed on Friday, offering little encouragement for Japan's central bank as it struggles to reach its ambitious 2 percent inflation target.
The data comes ahead of the Bank of Japan's rate review next week, when it is set to monetary policy steady and maintain its optimistic view on the economy even as global trade frictions and volatile markets cloud the growth outlook.
The core consumer price index (CPI) for Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, rose 1.0 percent in October from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast.
The pace of gain in the core CPI, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, was unchanged from September and driven largely by rising energy costs, the data showed.
The so-called core-core CPI, which strips away the effect of both energy and fresh food prices, rose 0.6 percent in October after increasing 0.7 percent in September.
""The boost from energy costs will start petering out from November. Core-core CPI also appears to be stalling,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""We may have to wait until next year for core-core CPI to accelerate its pace of increase, with help from wage hikes.""
The BOJ issues its inflation forecasts using core CPI figures, but has been recently looking more carefully at core-core CPI as a key measurement of demand-push pricing pressures.
Inflation has remained well below the BOJ's 2 percent target despite Japan's steady economic recovery, forcing the BOJ to maintain a massive stimulus despite the rising costs such as the hit to bank profits from years of near-zero interest rates.
Some analysts warn that Japan's economy may have contracted in the third quarter as a string of natural disasters disrupted supply chains and factory output.
Bad weather during the quarter also hurt crop and pushed up vegetable prices, which could depress private consumption by discouraging households from boosting discretionary spending.
Tokyo's overall CPI rose 1.5 percent in October from a year earlier, marking the highest increase since March 2015, as vegetable prices surged 23.4 percent, the data showed.

""Private consumption lacks momentum, so companies will remain cautious of raising prices. It's hard to be bullish on the outlook for core-core CPI,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

The companies signed up for $8.5 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $8.7 billion a year earlier, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA) said.
The decline in volume was likely a result of rising diesel prices, the impact of the dollar, lack of infrastructure stimulus, rising interest rates and tariffs, said Gary Peterson, chief executive of TCF Equipment Finance, which is an ELFA member.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals were 75.7 percent in September, down from 76.4 percent in August.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

847,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 01:27PM ET</span>",U.S. business spending on equipment cooling; goods trade deficit rises,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business spending on equipment appeared to have remained slow in September and the goods trade deficit widened further as rising imports outpaced a rebound in exports, suggesting economic growth moderated in the third quarter.
But the growth pace in the last quarter was probably solid, with other data on Thursday showing gains in both wholesale and retail inventories last month. A tightening labor market, which is steadily lifting wage growth, is also supporting the economy.
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1 percent last month amid weakening demand for fabricated metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components. 
That followed a 0.2 percent decrease in the so-called core capital goods orders in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.5 percent last month. Shipments of core capital goods were unchanged in September for a second straight month. 
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
""It looks like business has ordered up all the new equipment they need for now to meet the demand for their goods and services,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The third quarter may prove to be the high-water mark for U.S. manufacturing.""
Business spending on equipment is slowing after growing at a brisk pace for more than a year. It was buoyed by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which included a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate. 
But the impact of lower taxes is being offset by the administration's ""America First"" policies, which have led to a bitter trade war between the United States and China, as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with other major trade partners. 
Companies including  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), 3M Co (N:MMM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have complained about rising manufacturing costs as a result of the duties on imported steel and other raw materials. 
In its Beige Book report published on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said ""manufacturers reported raising prices of finished goods out of necessity as costs of raw materials such as metals rose, which they attributed to tariffs.""
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said the monetary union remained fragile and failed to assuage concerns about financial instability in Italy. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
TRADE DRAG
In another report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 0.8 percent to $76.0 billion in September. Exports of goods rose $2.5 billion to $141.0 billion last month, boosted by shipments of industrial supplies, motor vehicles, consumer and capital goods.
But food exports continued to decline, likely pulled down by shipments of soybeans, which have borne the brunt of Washington's trade fight with Beijing.
The rebound in goods exports last month was eclipsed by a $3.1 billion increase in goods imports to $217.0 billion. There were sharp increases in imports of consumer and capital good, reflecting robust domestic demand.
The anticipated drag on GDP growth from the deteriorating trade deficit is expected to be offset somewhat by an increase in inventory investment. The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.3 percent last month. Retail inventories gained 0.1 percent.
""We still look for trade to be a significant drag on third-quarter growth and inventories to be a significant boost,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""The big swings in trade and inventories between the second and third quarters are likely at least partially due to changes in activity associated with trade policy.""
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy probably grew at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter after expanding at a 4.2 percent pace in the April-June period. The government will publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP growth on Friday.
A third report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. Claims fell to 202,000 during the week ended Sept. 15, which was the lowest level since November 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 214,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, was unchanged at 211,750 last week.

The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment, with the unemployment rate close to a 49-year low of 3.7 percent. There are a record 7.14 million open jobs in the economy, suggesting a shortage of skilled workers.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, rose 0.5 percent to a reading of 104.6. The previous month's reading was revised slightly lower.
Economists had forecast pending home sales falling 0.1 percent in September.
Contracts were 1.0 percent lower than in September 2017.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two and are therefore seen as a good indicator of future existing home sales.
In September, contracts rose 4.5 percent in the West and 1.2 percent in the Midwest. They were down 1.4 percent in the South and 0.4 percent in the Northeast.

Median full-time weekly earnings increased 3.5 percent in the year to April 2018, the strongest growth in nominal terms for 10 years, the Office for National Statistics said in its Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said this month there were finally signs of a ""new dawn"" for pay increases as the steep fall in unemployment prompts many employers to offer more to keep and hire staff.
The BoE believes rising wages will create inflationary pressure and require further, gradual increases in interest rates, even as Britain's economy grows only slowly because of its impending departure from the European Union.
But Thursday's figures looked less positive when taking into account the rise in inflation caused in large part by the pound's plunge after the 2016 vote in favor of Brexit.
Real-terms median earnings rose by 1.2 percent in the 12 months to April 2018, the ONS said. Although that was a rebound from the 0.5 percent drop seen last year, growth was faster in 2016 and 2015.
""This mixed picture comes off the back of a disastrous decade for pay,"" said Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank that focuses on living standards.
The ONS said earnings adjusted for inflation remained 3.7 percent lower than in 2008, before the financial crisis.
""Worryingly, today's figures also show the first growth in pay inequality since 2010,"" Taylor said.
This was caused by a drop in hours worked by the lowest paid, offsetting a rise in the minimum wage, and coupled with an increase in wages for the highest earners.
Earlier on Thursday a survey from wage data firm XpertHR showed British companies have no plans to step up the pay awards they offer staff over the coming year, posing a challenge to BoE's forecasts of faster pay growth.
The BoE is due to publish new forecasts along with its interest rate decision on Nov. 1.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1 percent last month amid weakening demand for fabricated metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Data for August was revised up to show the so-called core capital goods orders decreasing 0.2 percent instead of the previously reported 0.9 percent decline.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.5 percent last month. Core capital goods orders increased 6.6 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods were unchanged in September for a second straight month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
The Commerce Department said it could not isolate the impact of Hurricanes Florence and Michael on the data.
Business spending on equipment slowed in the second quarter after growing at a brisk pace for more than a year. It is expected to make a modest contribution to GDP growth in the third quarter. Business spending on equipment is being underpinned by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which included a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate. 
But lower taxes are being offset by the administration's ""America First"" policies, which have led to a bitter trade war between the United States and China as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with other major trade partners. 
Companies including  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), 3M Co (N:MMM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have complained about rising manufacturing costs as a result of the duties on imported steel and other raw materials.

Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 0.8 percent in September as demand for transportation equipment rose 1.9 percent. That followed a 4.6 percent jump in durable goods orders in August.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 1.3 percent last month. Orders for defense aircraft surged 119.1 percent, offsetting a 17.5 percent drop in bookings for civilian aircraft.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday as expected, after a mammoth hike in September and an improvement in diplomatic relations with Washington helped the lira recoup some of its huge losses this year.
The lira  has plunged as ties with the United States soured and each side imposed tit-for-tat sanctions and additional tariffs. At the heart of the rift was the detention in Turkey of a U.S. pastor, who has now been released.
To underpin the currency and counter soaring inflation, the central bank last month ramped up its benchmark rate by 6.25 percentage points, in a move that also soothed investor concerns about the independence of the bank.
But, with inflation at 24.52 percent last month, economists have said the central room has left itself little space to breathe, particularly as President Tayyip Erdogan pushes for lower interest rates.
""They had some scope to keep rates unchanged for the time being but that does not mean they are completely out of the woods yet,"" said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging market strategist at SEB.
""If they signal an easing on monetary policy until the end of the year, the lira is at great risk of experiencing another wave of weakness, another sell-off.""
The bank left its one-week repo rate  at 24 percent on Thursday, having already raised its policy rate by 11.25 percentage points this year.
Twelve out of 15 economists in a Reuters poll had predicted the central bank would choose to leave its policy rate unchanged.
The currency is still down a third against the dollar this year, but it has found support since the release of U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson. 
""Although weaker domestic demand conditions will partially mitigate the deterioration in the inflation outlook, upside risks on the pricing behavior continue to prevail,"" the bank said in a statement.
(Graphic: Turkish inflation and cenbank funding - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ReALcb) 
KEEPING IT REAL
Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy"" of interest rates, wants to see cheaper credit flowing to companies to boost economy activity. His calls for lower rates have battered confidence in the central bank's ability to adequately respond to the rise in inflation, which hit a 15-year high in September.
After the central bank's decision the lira  initially weakened to 5.71 against the dollar, compared with 5.67 before the announcement. It stood at 5.68 at 1109 GMT.
Even after last month's big rate hike, Turkey is yet again without real interest rates - what economists call the rate once inflation is taken into account.
""The Turkish central bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged today and the accompanying statement reinforce our view that last month's aggressive rate hike didn't represent a shift back to orthodoxy,"" Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics said in a note. 
""Interest rates are unlikely to be raised further. Indeed, the bigger risk in our view is that, with President Erdogan starting to raise pressure for lower interest rates, that policy is loosened prematurely.""
Even as inflation remains high, there are worrying signs of a slow-down. Central bank data showed Turkish manufacturing confidence fell to 87.6 points in October, its lowest level since April 2009.

Consumer confidence, a measure of consumers' view of the economy's outlook, fell to its lowest in nearly 10 years in October.

The euro zone monetary authority left interest rates unchanged at zero, where they have remained since March 2016.
Despite the lack of surprise in Thursday’s decision, investors will pay close attention to the ECB press conference with President Mario Draghi as they look for any shift in the central bank’s outlook.
As the euro area grapples with global trade conflicts, Italian budget issues and messy Brexit negotiations, there is a small possibility that the ECB may see risks shifting from balanced to the downside.
“We don't think it'll be prepared to do this just yet,” Morgan Stanley economists said.
Although these experts do see growing risks, they believe that a relatively-robust pace of domestic expansion, along with potential upside risks from fiscal policy, are still sufficient to keep the recent balance.
With Thursday's decision, the ECB's deposit rate, currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at -0.40%, while the main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, stayed at 0.0%.
The ECB is likely to reiterate that it expects its asset purchase program to end in December after halving it to €15 billion per month starting in October.
The euro zone monetary authority announced plans to wind up its massive bond purchasing stimulus program at its June meeting.
In addition, the ECB's latest meeting minutes noted that trade tensions could lead to a decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from trade tariffs."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale deteriorated slightly more than expected in October as rising trade tensions and the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal dampened confidence.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Thursday its business climate index fell for the second month in a row to 102.8, below a Reuters consensus forecast of 103.0.
""Firms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead,"" said Ifo chief Clemens Fuest. ""Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.""
Consumption and state spending have been the main growth drivers in Germany as exports weaken. The dynamic domestic economy is expected to continue propelling an upswing seen entering its 10th year in 2019. 
But the risk of a no-deal Brexit, trade tensions and a lack of skilled workers are weighing on the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said it would be difficult for Germany to meet the 0.6 percent growth forecast for the fourth quarter given by the institute in its autumn report. The institute, however, is sticking to a full-year growth forecast of 1.7 percent.
""The golden autumn for the German economy is not materializing,"" Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding that pessimism was spreading in the auto industry where business expectations fell significantly, burdened by stricter emissions tests.
The government said earlier this month it expected growth to be slower in the third quarter, citing bottlenecks in the car sector stemming from the introduction of new pollution standards known as WLTP as a factor.
WEAK PHASE
The government has also lowered its economic growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent previously. It expects the economy to expand at the same pace in both 2019 and 2020. The economy grew 2.2 percent last year.
Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank said worries about Italy's spending plans were also clouding the outlook.
""The German economy is sliding into a weak phase,"" he said. ""Trade disputes, tough Brexit negotiations and concerns about Italy's state finances are unnerving companies.""
Financial markets have reacted negatively to Italy's expansionary budget, with bond yields rising to multi-year highs as investors fret over Rome's defiance of EU fiscal rules and the sustainability of its debt mountain -- the highest in the euro zone after Greece.
The European Commission has rejected Italy's 2019 budget deficit target but Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said his government would not change the plan.
Still, economists think the German economy will keep growing despite a weakening manufacturing sector and rising external risks. Low interest rates, a weak euro and planned tax cuts to help middle-income families should propel domestic demand.
""The uncertainty and the unpleasant gut feeling will continue,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba wrote in a research note.
""At the same time, however, the present situation of the German economy is still better than the recent stock market correction might suggest.""

The expected median pay award increase for the 12 months to the end of August next year was 2.4 percent, a touch below gains of 2.5 percent seen recently, wage data firm XpertHR said.
Rises in pay awards were stuck at around 2 percent for about seven years, despite a sharp fall in unemployment, before the recent improvement.
The pick-up raised hopes that a period of weak, sub-inflation wage growth was ending.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said this month that there were signs of a ""new dawn"" for pay increases.
""While the labor market is putting pressure on employers to keep up with their competitors when it comes to pay rises, many companies simply cannot afford to give higher pay increases,"" XpertHR pay and benefits editor Sheila Attwood said.
""Rising pension costs, due to pensions auto-enrolment, and uncertainty due to Brexit are likely to help keep pay award levels in check over the coming year.""
The BoE believes rising wages will create inflation pressure and require further, gradual increases in interest rates, even as Britain's economy grows only slowly because of Brexit.

While stronger net exports helped sustain expansion, a second-straight quarterly decline in corporate capital investment and a sharp drop in hiring are evidence that the economy is losing steam.
It’s no surprise that growth is slowing -- the central bank trimmed its 2018 forecast last week. The question is whether the latest numbers are bad enough and rising external risks severe enough that BOK policy makers stand pat again in November.
""If the BOK wants to increase the policy rate, it needs to provide good excuses, but none make much sense for a rate hike next month as the economy doesn’t look good, inflation remains benign and growth in household debt is slowing,"" said Cho Young-moo, an economist at LG Economic Research Institute.
The central bank cited rising external risks when it left its policy rate unchanged last week, even as Governor Lee Ju-yeol delivered a hawkish signal that he will soon seek to address growing financial imbalances, including record household debt and a widening rate gap with the U.S. He later said the BOK bank would consider raising rates next month as long as the economy remained stable.
Given the latest data, the economy may not even meet the BOK’s new 2018 growth forecast of 2.7 percent, said Joo Won, an economist at Hyundai Research Institute. ""The downward trend of economic growth has become more apparent.""
The U.S.-China trade war could definitely hurt South Korea, Joo said, especially if it worsens China’s own economic slowdown. ""If the trade battle hits China’s domestic market, it will be fatal for Korea’s exports,"" he said.
The won led Asian currencies lower Thursday, as dimming prospects for a rate hike combined with souring global risk sentiment. The won lost as much as 0.8 percent, hitting its weakest level in two weeks following a sell-off on Wall Street overnight.
The BOK held a meeting Thursday to discuss the impact of the U.S. stock rout. It reiterated that Korea’s economic fundamentals are stable, and said it would closely monitor conditions.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew slightly slower than expectations in the third quarter, and in line with the previous three-month period, as a plunge in domestic investment offset the positive effects from government stimulus and resilient exports.
Gross domestic product grew a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in July-September from the previous quarter, the Bank of Korea estimated on Thursday, just missing the median forecast of a 0.7 percent gain in a Reuters poll.
Construction investment shrank 6.4 percent in the quarter, marking the biggest decline since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, as government measures to curb rising housing prices discouraged home-building.
Private consumption, which accounts for almost half of the country's annual GDP, however, improved slightly, expanding 0.6 percent in the quarter and accelerating from 0.3 percent in the June quarter, supporting overall growth.
Analysts said turbulent global financial markets, uncertain trade prospects and doubts about the government's push to regulate the housing market and sharply increase minimum wages clouded the outlook.
""The negative factors that affected the third quarter remain pretty much the same and make the prospects uncertain for the current quarter as well,"" said Park Sang-hyun, economist at Leading Investment and Securities.
South Korean businesses have been reluctant to boost investment on concerns about global demand. In the property sector, builders have cut spending due to government curbs in the housing market while weak employment prospects have prompted consumers to cut spending.
From a year earlier, the economy expanded 2.0 percent, far slower than the second quarter's 2.8 percent and missing the poll estimate of 2.2 percent mainly due to the above-trend expansion seen in the comparable period last year.
The data on Thursday showed Asia's fourth largest economy is expected to keep its growth on track to meet the central bank's full-year projections at 2.7 percent, which was revised down from 2.9 percent.
In a major setback for President Moon Jae-in, who rose to power on a pledge to be South Korea's ""Jobs President"", annual employment growth has slowed every quarter since his election in May last year. In the last quarter, it posted its weakest growth in almost nine years.
The government has blamed demographic changes and challenges in a handful of sectors, but analysts attributed the poor tally to a series of pro-labor policies, including a 16 percent rise in minimum wages this year and a shorter work week.

This comes as the deepening U.S.-China trade dispute dampens the prospects for exports, the main engine of growth for the country, whose companies include manufacturing giants such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380).

861,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales near two-year low as mortgages rates rise,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a near two-year low in September and data for the prior three months was revised lower, the latest indications that rising mortgage rates and higher prices were sapping demand for housing.
Though housing accounts for a small share of gross domestic product, it has a bigger economic footprint. That is raising concerns that protracted housing market weakness could eventually spill over to the broader economy. Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year and is expected to have declined further in the third quarter.
""It is increasingly apparent that homes are getting too expensive to afford both on price and on financing costs,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""One thing is for certain, the economy cannot grow at a sustainable 3 percent pace for long if new home sales continue to tumble.""
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 553,000 units last month. That was the lowest level since December 2016. August's sales pace was revised down to 585,000 units from the previously reported 629,000 units.
June and July sales rates were also revised lower. New home sales have now declined for four straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.7 percent of housing market sales, falling 1.4 percent to a pace of 625,000 units last month. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They declined 13.2 percent from a year ago.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading lower, also tracking a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
The weak new home sales came on the heels of reports last week showing declines in homebuilding, permits and housing completions in September. In addition, sales of previously owned homes dropped to a near three-year low in September.
Economists blame the sluggishness on the more expensive home loans and higher house prices, which have outstripped wage growth, making home purchasing unaffordable for some first-time buyers. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has increased more than 80 basis points this year to an average of 4.85 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
A survey of homebuilders published last week showed builders complaining that ""housing affordability has become a challenge due to ongoing price and interest rate increases.""
NOT COLLAPSING
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said its home price index rose 6.1 percent in the year to August. House price inflation is slowing from a peak of 7.7 percent in February as demand slackens, but continues to outpace annual wage growth, currently below 3 percent.
Economists do not believe the housing market is headed for another collapse.
""I don't see that happening. The market never did reach the bubble stage, at least as far as sales are concerned,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The problem is that demand has not been evenly distributed across the nation and prices have soared in some areas.""
Mortgage rates are likely to rise further, with the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates in December for the fourth time this year. Another report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase a home rose 2 percent last week. Applications, however, remained 4 percent lower than two weeks ago.
Last month, new home sales in the South decreased 1.5 percent to their lowest level since August 2017. Sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, have now decreased for four straight months. 
Sales tumbled 12.0 percent in the West to a two-year low and plunged 40.6 percent in the Northeast to their lowest level since April 2015. They rose 6.9 percent in the Midwest. 
There were 327,000 new homes on the market in September, the most since January 2009 and up 2.8 percent from August. Supply is, however, just over half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom in 2006.
At September's sales pace it would take 7.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the most since March 2011, compared with 6.5 months in August. 

Nearly two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

863,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 10:12AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Raises Rates, Warns on Risk from U.S.-China Trade Dispute","Investing.com - The Bank of Canada increased interest rates as expected on Wednesday on the back of a solid global economic outlook, although policymakers voiced their concern over the risk of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China.
The BoC moved ahead and raised interest rates by a quarter of a point to 1.75%, marking the fifth rate hike since July 2017, as policymakers attempt to keep a booming Canadian economy in check.
“However, trade conflict, particularly between the United States and China, is weighing on global growth and commodity prices,” the bank warned.
The BoC commented that rates “will need to rise to a neutral stance to achieve the inflation target”, although the pace would depend on how the economy is adjusting to higher interest rates, given the elevated level of household debt.
Markets expect two more rate hikes in 2019, as Canada’s economy will continue to grow faster than its potential over the coming quarters thanks to U.S. fiscal stimulus boosting demand for its exports.
A deal at the end of September to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has reduced the risk of Canada’s exports being disrupted, setting the stage for more tightening from the central bank.
“The new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will reduce trade policy uncertainty in North America, which has been an important curb on business confidence and investment,” the BoC explained.
The BoC’s Business Outlook Survey, which was released last week and took place even before the trade deal between the U.S. and Canada was reached, revealed that Canadian companies are expecting to ramp up investment as business sentiment remains at elevated levels.
Traders will look for further details on the path for monetary policy at the press conference by BoC Governor Stephen Poloz, which begins at 11:15 AM ET (15:15 GMT). 
At the end of September, Poloz insisted that the central bank would continue to gradually increase rates as it did not want to let inflation momentum build."

The preliminary reading of the Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to a 26-month low of 52.1 this month from 53.2 in September.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The services PMI slowed to a 24-month low of 53.3, compared to expectations for 54.5, from 54.7 a month earlier.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors came in at a 25-month low of 52.7 from 54.1, compared to expectations for 53.9.
In a sign that the slowdown has further to run, companies’ expectations of future growth slipped to the lowest for nearly four years, with a near six-year low seen in manufacturing.
Reduced optimism further dented hiring, hitting jobs growth, while price pressures remained elevated, close to seven-year highs.
“The pace of Eurozone economic growth slipped markedly lower in October, with the PMI setting the scene for a disappointing end to the year,"" Chris Williamson chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
“The slowdown is being led by a drop in exports, linked in turn by many survey respondents to trade wars and tariffs, which appears to have darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion,"" he added.
“The survey will make for uncomfortable reading at the ECB. Although the survey’s price gauges remain elevated and close to seven-year highs, the headline PMI has fallen to a level that would historically be consistent with a bias towards loosening monetary policy in order to prevent any further deterioration of economic growth.”

The closely-watched report underlined worries that the euro zone's largest economy may be losing steam heading into the fourth quarter, raising concerns about the potential fallout from a global trade war.
Market research group Markit said that its Flash German Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors fell to 52.7 this month, the lowest since May 2015, from 55.0 in September. Economists had forecast a reading of 54.8.
The flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index slumped to 52.3, the lowest in 29 months, from a final reading of 53.7 in September. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 53.5.
The preliminary German services purchasing managers’ index declined to a five-month low of 53.6 this month, down from 55.9. That was below expectations for a reading of 55.5.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Commenting on the report, Phil Smith, Principal Economist at Markit, said, “The rise in overall business activity was the weakest in almost three-and-a-half years, reflecting not only a further easing of manufacturing production growth, but also a slowdown in the previously steadfast service sector.""

A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The manufacturing PMI fell to a 25-month low of 51.2, compared to expectations for 52.4 and from 52.5 a month earlier. The report said a decline in demand across the automotive sector led businesses to reduce production.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose to a two-month high of 54.3 from 54.0, beating expectations for 53.8.
“October data signalled a mixed picture for the French private sector. On one hand, service sector activity growth accelerated to a four-month high thanks to stronger new business growth. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector shifted down a gear in October, as firms reported the first fall of output for over two years,"" Sam Teague, economist at survey compiler Markit said.
Job creation accelerated, with the rate of employment growth the strongest since April. The improvement was driven by stronger growth in the service sector, as jobs rose in manufacturing only slightly.
The report said business confidence remained strongly optimistic, but noted that positive sentiment eased fractionally since September, partly due to a deterioration in business confidence among manufacturing firms to the lowest in 28 months."

The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 26th consecutive month and reached the highest level since April.
""Export sales rose for the first time since May, despite several respondents highlighting problems arising from global trade tensions,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""That said, next month's data will be important to assess whether the latest growth rebound is a transitory response to weakness resulting from recent natural disasters.""
The index for new export orders rose to a preliminary 51.7 from a final 49.8 in September.
The United States and China have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in recent months, and plans for bilateral trade talks to resolve the dispute have stalled.
Japan is potentially at risk as it exports to exports manufacturing equipment and electronic parts, which are used to make finished goods for the United States and other markets.
Confidence among Japanese manufacturers rose in October from September but is expected to remain flat over the coming three months, a Reuters tankan survey showed last week.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's core inflation gauge in September missed forecasts and edged down slightly to 1.8 percent from a year earlier due to lower retail inflation, data showed on Tuesday. 
September's data comes weeks after Singapore's central bank tightened monetary policy for the second time this year and announced that inflation is projected to rise in the near term.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll was for core inflation to be 1.9 percent, unchanged from the 4-year highs seen in August and July.
""I'm quite surprised that inflation eased from the four-year high in the last two months,"" Alvin Liew, an economist at UOB, told Reuters. 
""If you followed the MAS policy, you'd expect it to edge higher,"" he added. 
The central bank's core inflation measure excludes changes in the price of cars and accommodation, which are influenced more by government policies.
Singapore's headline consumer price index rose less than expected at 0.7 percent in September from a year earlier, unchanged from August. This was also lower than the median forecast in a Reuters poll which called for all-items CPI to rise 0.8 percent. 
Despite the slower-than-expected inflation gauge, economists like Liew say it is too early to tell if MAS will stop their tightening trajectory next year. 
""We have to look at it on a trend basis,"" Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan said. 

""I think it's premature to call it on these numbers,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - British households' confidence in their finances worsened this month as their earnings from employment rose at the weakest rate since February, adding to growing signs of caution among consumers, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit Household Finance Index, watched by the Bank of England as a gauge of consumers' financial health, cooled to a three-month low of 45.1 from 45.7 in September, though the reading is still one of the highest since the survey's 2009 launch.
The survey's findings may raise eyebrows among BoE officials who expect inflation pressure to pick up over the next couple of years, driven by a gradual pick-up in wage growth.
Data firm IHS Markit said the British public's inflation expectations for the next 12 month fell this month to the lowest in two years, while optimism about house prices was the lowest since July 2016 -- just after the Brexit vote.
""UK households cast their most downbeat assessment of current finances in three months in October as weaker earnings growth from employment limited cash availability,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
""Looking ahead, households were more concerned about their future budgets.""
Other gauges of financial sentiment among households have also soured recently.
Expectations for personal finances over the next 12 months struck a five-month low in September, according to a closely-watched report from pollsters GfK. 
And the latest Thomson Reuters/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index showed 23 percent of households expect their finances to weaken over the next year -- the biggest proportion since March 2013.
IHS Markit said households' expectations for Bank of England interest rates were barely changed compared from a month ago, with half of households expecting another interest rate hike within the next six months.

The survey of 1,500 people was conducted between Oct. 11 and Oct. 16.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",China's September new home price gains led by smaller cities,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices increased at a firm pace in September, supported by gains in smaller cities and showing the market remained resilient despite pressures from softer investment, a slowing economy and government curbs on the sector.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.9 percent in September from a month earlier, Reuters calculated from official data published on Saturday, slower than the previous month's reading of 1.4 percent, which was the fastest growth in two years.
Compared with a year ago, however, new home prices climbed 7.9 percent, the quickest year-on-year gain since August 2017 and faster than the previous month's 7 percent rise.
Prices continued to rise despite tougher curbs designed to rein in a near-three-year real estate boom that has spilled over from megacities to the hinterland.
In a sign of continued broad-based market strength, 64 out of the 70 cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported a monthly price increase for new homes, though the number was down from 67 in August.
While solid growth in the sector could cushion the impact of a vigorous multi-year government crackdown on debt and escalating trade tensions with the United States, it could also stoke fears of a bubble if prices climb aggressively.
Real estate has been one of the few bright spots in China's investment landscape, partly due to robust sales in smaller cities where a government clampdown on speculation has not been as aggressive as it has in larger cities.
Xia Dan, an analyst at Bank of Communications in Beijing, warned market expectations for property prices was moderating as the government tightened its property market controls. 
""There are increasing uncertainties about the future trends in the housing market,"" Xia said.
There have already been some signs of caution in the market, as authorities stepped up controls in hundreds of cities. Transactions fell sharply over the period dubbed ""Golden September and Silver October"", traditionally a high season for new home sales.
Prices in China's largest cities where the strictest control measures are in place, were mostly stable in September, though Guangzhou prices rose 0.4 percent on-month and 4.3 percent year-on-year. 
The top price performer in September was Xian, the capital of China's northwestern Shaanxi province, whose prices rose a blistering 6.2 percent from the previous month, NBS data showed.
Official data this week showed growth in China's real estate investment eased in September while home sales fell for the first time since April, as developers dialed back expansion plans amid economic uncertainties and as additional curbs on speculative investment kicked in.
Real estate investment, which mainly focuses on residential but also includes commercial and office space, rose 8.9 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with a 9.2 percent rise in August.
Property sales by floor area fell 3.6 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with a 2.4 percent gain in August, according to Reuters calculations, the first decline since April. In year-to-date terms, property sales rose 2.9 percent in the first three quarters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell in September by the most in over two years as the housing market continued to struggle despite strength across the broader economy. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Friday that existing home sales dropped 3.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million units last month.
Home sales have now fallen for six straight months. A dearth of properties for sale has pushed up prices, sidelining many would-be homeowners. Sales dropped the most in the South and the decline in the West left sales there down 12.2 percent from a year earlier. 
NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said the overall decline appeared related to a rise in interest rates.
Supply has also been constrained by rising building material costs as well as land and labor shortages, while rising mortgage rates are expected to slow demand.
The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs in September for the third time this year and is widely expected to hike rates again in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales falling to 5.30 million from a previously reported 5.34 million. Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales.
There were 1.88 million homes on the market in September, an increase of 1.1 percent from a year ago.
At September's sales pace, it would take 4.4 months to clear the current inventory. A supply of six to seven months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The median house price increased 4.2 percent from one year ago to $258,100 in September.

The acceleration in Japan’s inflation backs up Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s decision Thursday to upgrade his assessment of the current strength of price growth to around 1 percent from a range of 0.5 percent to 1 percent. Yet the renewed momentum still leaves the BOJ a long way from its inflation goal and still reliant on higher energy prices to pull up the overall index. As Kuroda said in a Bloomberg interview last week, the critical element needed to drive inflation toward 2 percent is higher pay that can fuel consumption.

Highlights of Jobless Claims (Week ended Oct. 13)
Key Takeaways
While no states had estimated claims last week, the Labor Department said filings in Florida were affected by Hurricane Michael and North Carolina and South Carolina felt the effects of Hurricane Florence. Filings fell in all three states.
Michael, which made landfall on Oct. 10 in Florida’s panhandle, disrupted offshore oil production and other economic activity in large swathes of the region including Georgia and South Carolina.
While claims may remain volatile in coming weeks, the impact of Florence -- which struck North Carolina and South Carolina in mid-September -- is fading. Economists predict the weather impact will be temporary, based on the pattern around previous major storms such as Harvey and Irma in 2017.
The data also covered the week containing the 12th of the month, which coincides with the reference period for the Labor Department’s survey for the monthly jobs report. Applications for unemployment benefits remain largely consistent with a tight labor market and strong demand for workers.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",U.S. mortgage industry faces job losses as refinancing dries up,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With mortgage applications falling to their lowest since late-2014, the U.S. home lending industry is facing a major overhaul in how it works and manages staffing levels. 
Call-center employees who handle customer refinance requests are the most vulnerable as rates have started to climb, analysts said.
Those applications have fallen to their lowest level since late 2000, according to a seasonally adjusted index by the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinancing made up about 37 percent of mortgage originations in the first quarter of this year, down from 75 percent at its peak in 2012.
That decline has come as interest rates on most 30-year mortgages has climbed to 5.1 percent, the highest since February 2011. 
Homeowners who have borrowed since then lack the opportunity to save money by refinancing. 
""We're going to see people losing their jobs in this industry because of the loss of refinance business,"" said Joseph Murin, chairman of JJAM Financial Services LLC and a 46-year veteran of the mortgage business.
What's happening in the mortgage industry reflects a perennial financial industry trend of firing and rehiring thousands of employees in various businesses as revenue ebbs or flows. 
During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, U.S. banks laid off mortgage workers as demand froze and they faced huge losses in the business. Soon after, bank executives found themselves hiring people to deal with delinquent loans and mortgage companies staffed up to refinance loans as interest rates fell. 
This time, the decline in mortgage employees may be stickier because major lenders and their technology-enabled rivals, such as Quicken and loanDepot Inc, have tried to automate much more of the business.
The industry employs about 350,000 people, the same as in 2002, according to government labor data gathered by the MBA. Employment reached 500,000 at its peak during the housing bubble.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co were the two largest U.S. mortgage lenders during the first six months of this year, representing 7 percent of the market, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The two recently said they had cut 400 and 600 mortgage jobs, respectively.
Still, the industry is overstaffed, chief financial officers of the two banks said during earnings conference calls with analysts on Friday.
""There's excess capacity in the market right now,"" said JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake. ""It will clear itself over the course of the coming months.""
High staffing levels, combined with the chill of rising interest rates on mortgage revenue, are bad for big banks' mortgage businesses, Moody's Investors Service said in a report on Wednesday.
In addition to Wells and JPMorgan, other large players include Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and regional lenders like U.S. Bancorp.
Newer mortgage companies may have the most to lose after gobbling up refinancing market share through competitive online offerings. But they have struggled to compete when providing initial loans to buy homes, experts said.
Originating new mortgages remains hard to digitize, involving not just notarizing signed documents, but relationships with real estate brokers on the ground. (http://reut.rs/21jMCEH)
Some privately held mortgage companies that relied on refinancing are unprofitable now, said Moody's credit analyst Warren Kornfeld.

""They just want revenue to cover their expense base,"" he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Chambers of Industry and Commerce DIHK on Thursday cut its 2018 growth forecast to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent and predicted a slowdown to 1.7 percent next year as Europe's largest economy faces mounting risks at home and abroad.
The forecasts are based on the assumption that global trade disputes do not escalate and Britain does not crash out of the European Union without a deal, as companies cited a shortage of skilled labor as a particular domestic concern.
""The air is getting thinner, the concerns are getting bigger,"" DIHK Managing Director Martin Wansleben said.
""Companies are noticeably more cautious about their business outlook, we see the biggest deterioration in business expectations in four years.""
Wansleben said the revised forecast was ""disappointing"" but there was no risk of recession.
According to the DIHK autumn survey, companies scaled back business expectations to 11 points from 17 in spring. Morale regarding current conditions remained at 45 points.
The survey of around 27,000 managers, the biggest of its kind, found that companies viewed shortages of skilled labor and rising labor costs as the principal risks for their business outlook. Construction, transport and health services were among the sectors most affected.
Wansleben called on government and parliament to quickly pass a planned immigration law to attract more skilled workers from outside the European Union.
""But a modern immigration law is not enough. Germany also needs to do more to become a more attractive, more welcoming place for foreigners - otherwise nobody will come,"" he said. 
Protectionist U.S. trade policies and Brexit remained a concern, limiting willingness to invest. DIHK expects gross capital investments growth to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 from 3.3 percent this year.
""Given the rapid pace of change, for example in global trade policies or digitalization - and the unclear outcome of Brexit, it is becoming more difficult for companies to foresee a clear trend in their business development,"" DIHK said.
Imports should outpace exports this year and next, DIHK said, a sign that domestic demand can provide a buffer against external shocks.
DIHK saw state consumption rising 1.4 percent in 2018 and 2.5 percent in 2019, while private consumption is forecast to increase 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent.

884,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",UK Retail Sales Fall by 0.8% in September,"Investing.com - Retail sales in the UK fell more sharply than expected in September, according to data released on Thursday, as consumers bought less food.
UK retail sales fell 0.8% last month, the Office for National Statistics said, double the 0.4% drop forecast by economists. That was compared to a 0.4% increase in August.
The decline came as shoppers cut back on food purchases after strong sales in August.
""In September 2018, the quantity bought declined by 0.8% when compared with August 2018, due mainly to a large fall of 1.5% in food stores; the largest decline in food store sales since October 2015,"" the ONS said.
In the three months to September retail sales increased by 1.2%.
“Retail continued to grow in the three months to September with jewellery shops and online stores seeing particularly strong sales,” ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said. “This was despite a stark slowdown in food sales in September, following a bumper summer.”
On a year-over-year basis, retail sales were up 3% last month."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept its benchmark rate unchanged on Thursday but flagged concerns about mounting household debt and financial stability, boosting expectations that it could raise rates as soon as next month.
While the Bank of Korea downgraded its gross domestic product growth forecasts for this year amid growing risks to global trade, its governor said the revised outlook still reflected the country's ""potential growth rate"".
The central bank kept its benchmark seven-day repurchase rate  at 1.50 percent, as expected by 14 of 21 economists in a Reuters poll.
However, two of the bank's seven board members voted against the decision to hold rates, BOK governor Lee Ju-yeol said at a press conference after the decision on Thursday, an indication it may be moving towards a change in policy.
Governor Lee flagged worries about rising household debt and said ""it's time to focus on financial imbalances if economic recovery is stable and inflation is reaching the target level.""
Board members Lee Il-houng and Koh Seung-beom dissented in a 5-2 vote to keep the benchmark unchanged. 
In the past, dissenting votes at policy meetings have portended subsequent changes in the rate. In 2017, Lee Il-houng voted against the hold in October before the board raised rates the following month, the first tightening in more than six years. 
""(Lee's press conference) was more hawkish than markets had expected. Lee said many times that its time to focus on financial stability now that growth rate is nearing the nation's potential level, and inflation is reaching the target level,"" said Park Sung-woo, a fixed-income analyst at Heungkuk Securities.
""A hike in November is almost a done deal.""
The December contract on South Korea's three-year treasury bond futures  fell 0.04 points to 108.43 after the press conference, a sign markets were pricing in a rate hike this year.
South Korea's policymakers have voiced concerns about a debt-binge in the private sector. Household debt was about 95 percent of GDP in the first quarter of this year, data from the Bank for International Settlement shows, far above the average of 60.8 percent for the Group of 20 nations. 
Rising U.S. interest rates have also created concern among policymakers and investors about the growing gap between benchmark rates in South Korea and the U.S. and the potential for capital flight.
While headline inflation is still below the bank's target of 2.0 percent, September consumer inflation inched up to 1.9 percent in annual terms, removing a potential hurdle for further policy tightening.
There are, however, persistent risks to the monetary policy outlook.
Lee said the GDP growth forecast for this year was cut to 2.7 percent from the previous projection of 2.9 percent.
A statement released after the rate decision showed policymakers were concerned about weak job growth and trade frictions between the United States and China, which are raising fears of collateral damage to other export-reliant Asian economies.
The accelerating tit-for-tat trade war between Beijing and Washington also leaves South Korea's export sector vulnerable with shipments declining 8.2 percent in September from a year earlier, the biggest drop in over two years.
South Korea's labor market recovered modestly from a month earlier with the unemployment rate falling to 4.0 percent in September from 4.2 percent in seasonally adjusted terms, but the government report showed manufacturers and retailers still shedding jobs following increases in minimum wages.

The BOK's next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Nov. 30.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 10:54PM ET</span>",Japan exports fall for first time since 2016 as trade war fears mount,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in September for the first time since 2016 as shipments to the United States and China declined, likely impeding third quarter economic growth and adding to concerns about the broadening impact of an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war. 
The data comes days after a Reuters poll showed a third of Japanese companies - not just exporters - have been affected by the trade conflict between the world's two biggest economies, and more than half worried about its fallout on their business.
Japanese policymakers also remain wary about the overall economic impact of the international trade frictions. A string of natural disasters that struck Japan has added to the strain on factories, disrupting output and physical distribution.
The U.S.-Sino tariff row has yet to materially hurt trade activity, but a slowdown in external demand has bolstered views that Japan's economy, the world's third largest, likely slowed sharply in the July-September quarter.
""The economy probably grew only slightly in the third quarter, led by firm consumption and brisk capex. External demand likely made no contribution,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Assuming the U.S.-China trade frictions have widespread effects on global trade, Japan's exports will struggle to grow.""
Minami said declines in shipments to the United States and China - the two key export destinations for Japan - are a source of concern as each of them accounts for about 20 percent of Japanese exports, respectively.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Thursday showed Japanese exports fell 1.2 percent in September from a year earlier, against a 1.9 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed a 6.6 percent gain in August.
It was the first decline since November 2016.
In volume terms, exports fell 4.8 percent in the year to September, the first drop in seven months.
Japan's exports to the United States declined 0.2 percent in the year to September, dragged down by falling shipments of construction and mining machinery, auto parts and medicines.
U.S.-bound auto exports amounted to some 143,000 cars, down 7.0 percent year-on-year in a snapback from the previous year's brisk shipments, a sign that car sales have leveled off.
Imports from the United States rose 3.1 percent in September, led by crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, helping reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States by 4.0 percent year-on-year to 590 billion yen ($5.24 billion).
The U.S. Trade Representative's office told Congress on Tuesday it would open trade talks with Japan, describing the country as an important yet underperforming market for U.S. exports. 
TRUMP THREAT
Tokyo and Washington last month agreed to start trade talks in an arrangement that, for now, avoids the worst-case scenario of an imminent 25 percent tariff on cars. 
Trump has made clear he is unhappy with Japan's $69 billion trade surplus with the United States - nearly two-thirds of it from auto exports - and wants a two-way agreement to address it.
Tokyo pushed back on a straight bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that Washington had sought, fearing it could put Japan under pressure to open politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture.
Thursday's trade data showed exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, fell 1.7 percent in the year to September, the first decline in seven months, dragged down by semiconductor production equipment.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, rose 0.9 percent.
Overall imports rose 7.0 percent in the year to September, versus the median estimate for a 13.7 percent annual increase.
The trade balance was surplus of 139.6 billion yen, compared with the median estimate for a shortfall of 50.0 billion yen.
""External demand has likely put a drag on Japan's economy,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Going forward, exports may recover from supply constraints, but effects from slowdown in emerging markets, and the U.S.-China trade war remain a source of concern.""

887,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Australian Unemployment Drops to Lowest in More Than Six Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s jobless rate fell in September to 5 percent -- a level estimated by policy makers to signal the beginning of labor shortages -- but the driving force was fewer people seeking work.
Australia’s jobless rate -- a key metric for the Reserve Bank-- has edged lower this year, even as the impact of solid hiring is tempered by a burgeoning workforce. Policy makers have kept their key interest rate at a record low for a prolonged stretch to help boost hiring and spur the economy, which expanded at the fastest pace in six years in the second quarter.
That, in time, should rekindle inflation and potentially clear the path for the first rate hike since 2010; however, traders see little prospect of that happening in the next 12 months."
888,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 03:58PM ET</span>","Hurricane Florence, rising mortgage rates hurt U.S. homebuilding","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding dropped more than expected in September as construction activity in the South fell by the most in nearly three years, likely held down by Hurricane Florence.
Other details of the report published by the Commerce Department on Wednesday were also soft. Building permits declined to their lowest level in almost 1-1/2 years and homebuilding completions were the fewest since November 2017. 
The housing market, which has been a weak spot in a robust economy, has been hobbled by an acute shortage of properties for sale, higher home prices and rising mortgage rates. Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year and the latest data supports economists' expectations that housing remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.
""The housing market continues to sputter,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The question is if the low level of starts, permits and completions we've seen the last four months is a lull or a slide that won't be corrected until the next recession.""
Housing starts fell 5.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.201 million units last month. Data for August was revised down to show starts rising to a rate of 1.268 million units instead of the previously reported pace of 1.282 million units. 
Starts in the South, which accounts for the bulk of homebuilding, tumbled 13.7 percent last month. That was the biggest decline since October 2015. Hurricane Florence slammed North and South Carolina in mid-September and flooding from the storm probably depressed homebuilding last month.
Housing starts also fell 14.0 percent in the Midwest. They surged 29 percent in the Northeast and rose 6.6 percent in the West. Building permits fell 0.6 percent to a rate of 1.241 million units in September. That was the second straight monthly decline and left permits at their lowest level since May 2017. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts declining to a pace of 1.220 million units last month. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading lower, tracking a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. 
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell marginally.
RISING MORTGAGE RATES
Rising mortgage rates and higher house prices are making home purchasing unaffordable for some first-time buyers.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumped 19 basis points to 4.90 percent last week, the highest level since mid-April 2011, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The mortgage rate has risen about 91 basis points this year.
A separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase a home fell to a 20-month low last week.
While mortgage rates are still low by historical standards, the rise has outpaced annual wage growth, which has been stuck below 3 percent. House prices have increased 6.0 percent on an annual basis and are being driven by the dearth of properties. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, decreased 0.9 percent to a rate of 871,000 units in September. Single-family homebuilding has lost momentum since hitting a pace of 948,000 units last November, which was the strongest in more than 10 years.
""The flattening of housing construction is essentially in place,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""Wage growth has begun to improve but not enough to give people the necessary income to carry a mortgage - especially for younger families, many still working out from under student loans.""
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rose in October, but builders said ""housing affordability has become a challenge due to ongoing price and interest rate increases.""
Permits to build single-family homes rose 2.9 percent in September to a pace of 851,00 units. They, however, remain below the level of single-family starts, suggesting limited scope for a strong rebound in homebuilding.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment plunged 15.2 percent to a rate of 330,000 units in September. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes declined 7.6 percent to a pace of 390,000 units. They have now dropped for six straight months.
With starts and building permits declining last month, housing supply will likely remain tight. That was also reinforced by a 4.1 percent drop in homebuilding completions in September to a rate of 1.161 million units, the lowest level since November 2017.

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. While the stock of housing under construction increased 0.3 percent to more than an 11-year high of 1.129 million units last month, the multi-family homes segment accounted for much of the increase.

889,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Fed Minutes: Fed Reiterates Gradual Rate Hikes Amid Strong Economic Growth,"Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers reaffirmed their commitment to gradually raising interest rates as the ""strong"" rate of economic growth continued and inflation remained within its target range, according to the minutes of the Fed's September meeting published Wednesday.
""Participants generally anticipated that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term,"" the minutes showed.
The Federal Reserve said real GDP appeared to be rising at a ""strong"" rate in the third quarter, similar to its pace in the first half of the year, adding that the impact of damage from Hurricane Florence on economic growth in the second half of the year would be ""transitory.""
The Fed raised its benchmark rate to a range of 2.00% to 2.25% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Sept. 26 and projected that they’d likely raise rates three times in 2019 after one more hike later this year.
In a sign that Fed members were willing to tolerate a slight overshoot on inflation, several participants commented ""that inflation may modestly exceed 2% for a period of time,"" according to the minutes.
In the wake of recent criticism, the FOMC defended its gradual approach to raising rates, asserting that it prevents the economy from slowing down too quickly and ensures inflation remains stable .
""This gradual approach would balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation moving below the Committee's objective, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could engender inflation persistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances.""
The Fed's minutes come as investors fret that rising bond yields will increase borrowing costs, stifling global growth. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pledged in early October to continue raising rates.
""Interest rates are still accommodative, but we’re gradually moving to a place where they’ll be neutral,” neither holding back nor spurring growth, Powell said.
The majority of traders expect the Fed to stand pat on interest rates in November, but hike rates for the fourth time this year in December.
According to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, the odds of a fourth rate in December stood at more than 80%."

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers filed the fewest requests for a mortgage since late 2014 last week as most home borrowing costs reached their highest levels in more than seven years, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
Loan applications for home refinancing tumbled to their lowest level since late 2000, while mortgage requests to buy a home dropped to their weakest level in 20 months, MBA data showed.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage applications fell 7.1 percent to 322.1 in the week ended Oct. 12. This was the lowest reading since 296.9 set in the Dec. 26, 2014 week. It also marked the steepest weekly decline in about 13 months.
The latest figures did not include adjustments for the Columbus Day holiday last Monday, MBA said.
The jump in mortgage rates is another headwind for the housing sector that is already struggling with lean inventory and rising building costs.
Interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages, whose balances are $453,100 or less, on average climbed 0.05 percentage point to 5.10 percent, which was the highest level since February 2011.
Home borrowing costs rose in step with a dramatic selloff in the U.S. bond market, which propelled the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes to 3.261 percent last Tuesday which was its highest in 7-1/2 years.
Investors had dumped bonds on worries about rising inflation and a faster pace of rate increases from the Federal Reserve prompted by robust economic data. 
Bond yields have retreated on safe-haven demand for bonds spurred by sharp losses in global equity markets. The 10-year yield was about 3.15 percent early on Wednesday. 
The average interest rate on 30-year home loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, often used by first-time home-buyers and borrowers with patchy credit, increased to 4.50 percent, the highest since February 2011.
Interest rates on 15-year fixed-rate and five-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 4.50 percent and 4.34 percent, respectively, to their highest readings in over seven years, MBA data showed.
However, the average rate on jumbo mortgages, or loans with balances greater than $453,100, dipped to 4.98 percent from 4.99 percent. 
MBA's seasonally-adjusted barometer on loan requests to buy a home fell 5.9 percent to 224.0, the lowest level since February 2017. 

The group's seasonally-adjusted gauge on applications for mortgage refinancing dropped 9.0 percent to 838.1, the lowest since December 2000. Its weekly decline was the largest since July 2017.

Consumer price inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in September, compared with August's unexpected six-month high of 2.7 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.
That was well below the consensus of a Reuters poll of economists for a fall to 2.6 percent.
""Food was the main downward pull on inflation as last year's September price rises failed to reappear, while ferry prices dropped after their surprisingly high summer peak,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said.
On Tuesday, the ONS said the basic wages of workers rose at their fastest pace in nearly a decade over the summer months. 
That backed up the Bank of England's view that a long period of weak pay increases is ending, and that it should raise interest rates in response.
Still, the wage growth of 3.1 percent remained meager by historical standards when adjusted for inflation.
The BoE expects inflation will drift down but will remain just above its 2 percent target in two years' time as it gradually raises borrowing costs.
Consumer price inflation hit a five-year high of 3.1 percent in November, when the inflationary effect of the pound's tumble after Brexit vote in June 2016 reached its peak.
While that has started to subside, Wednesday's ONS figures suggested there could be more short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.
Among manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 10.3 percent higher than in September 2017, up from a revised 9.4 percent in August.
That was a bigger rise than any economist had forecast in the Reuters poll that had pointed to a rise of 9.2 percent.
Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by 3.1 percent compared with 2.9 percent in August, again stronger than all forecasts in the poll that had pointed to a 2.9 percent increase.

The ONS also said house prices in August rose by an annual 3.2 percent across the United Kingdom as a whole, the smallest rise since August 2013 and compared with a 3.4 percent increase in July. Prices in London alone slipped 0.2 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries fell for a third straight month in August to their lowest in more than a year, Treasury Department data showed on Tuesday, in what was likely a move to support its currency in the face of emerging market volatility.
Data showed that China's Treasuries' holdings fell to $1.165 trillion in August, from $1.171 trillion in July. The world's second-largest economy, though, remains the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries.
""This was probably just to support China's currency and just to handle day-to-day flows,"" said Jon Hill, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
""August also coincided with emerging market volatility as well as some slight depreciation in the renminbi in the middle of August,"" he added.
In August, the U.S.-China tariff war escalated, and the concern was that China would retaliate by cutting its vast holdings of Treasuries.
But BMO's Hill said there has been no evidence of that based on the August report.
""It certainly doesn't appear that China is weaponizing its Treasury holdings just given the small decline and the general lack of market reverberations,"" Hill added.
Japan's holdings of Treasuries also dropped in August, to $1.029 trillion, the lowest since October 2011. In July, Japan's holdings were at $1.035 trillion.
Japanese investors sold U.S. and German bonds and bought British debt in August, data from Japan's Ministry of Finance showed last week, though they may have become net buyers of U.S. debt in October. The investors turned net sellers of U.S. bonds and disposed a net 626.5 billion yen ($5.54 billion) worth of debt in August, the data showed.
Data also showed foreigners bought more than three times as much in U.S. Treasuries in August than in July, posting the largest inflow since June 2015.
Purchases of U.S. Treasuries totaled $63.13 billion in August, up from $18.94 billion the previous month. Treasury inflows were led by private investors, who bought $55.57 billion.
Analysts said this reflects high yields on Treasuries compared with fixed-income securities of other major economies.
Benchmark 10-year yields started August with a yield of 3.0 percent and ended down at 2.85 percent.
The report also showed foreigners bought net long-term U.S. securities for a second straight month in August to the tune of $131.8 billion.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 01:34PM ET</span>",U.S. industrial output rises; job openings at record high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production increased for a fourth straight month in September, boosted by gains in manufacturing and mining output, but momentum slowed sharply in the third quarter.
Other data on Tuesday showed job openings hit a record high in August, far outpacing a rise in hiring, suggesting that companies were increasingly being starved of workers. There are concerns that the worker shortage, especially in manufacturing and construction industries, could hinder economic growth. 
""Companies need more workers than the economy has to give and this is going to lead to a slowdown in economic growth somewhere down the road,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial output rising 0.2 percent in September. 
Industrial production grew at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, decelerating from the 5.3 percent pace logged in the second quarter. The Fed reported a minimal impact to production from Hurricane Florence, which drenched South and North Carolina in mid-September. 
Manufacturing output increased 0.2 percent in September, the smallest gain in four months, after rising 0.3 percent in August. A 1.7 percent increase in motor vehicle production helped to lift manufacturing output last month. 
Motor vehicle production surged 4.3 percent in August. There were also strong increases in the production of primary metals, machinery and wood products last month.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, boosted by upbeat earnings from blue-chip companies. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is being supported by a strong domestic economy. Momentum is, however, slowing against the backdrop of a strong dollar and cooling global growth, which is restraining exports.
The dollar has this year gained about 6.2 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.
While there are so far few signs the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies, which have left the United States embroiled in a bitter trade war with China, are undercutting production, manufacturers having been increasingly complaining about disruptions to the supply chain.
MANUFACTURING SEEN WEAKENING
""The appreciation of the dollar and slowdown in global growth will weigh on the sector more heavily in the months ahead, so growth in manufacturing output still looks set to weaken from here,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
Manufacturing output increased at a 2.8 percent rate in the third quarter after growing at a 2.3 percent pace in the April-June period. Mining production increased 0.5 percent in September, adding to the 0.4 percent rise in August. 
Oil and gas well drilling, however, fell for a third straight month in September. Mining output grew at an 11.4 percent rate in the third quarter after notching a 16.5 percent pace in the second quarter. The sector has rebounded about 24 percent from its trough in 2016.
Utilities output was unchanged in September after soaring 1.1 percent in the prior month. A surge in natural gas output was offset by a decline in the production of electricity.
Capacity utilization for the industrial sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, was unchanged at 78.1 percent. It increased to 78.0 percent in the third quarter, the highest level since the first quarter of 2015, from 77.8 percent in the April-June period. 
The industrial production data strengthened expectations of strong economic growth in the third quarter. Growth forecasts for the July-September period are above a 3.0 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter. While strong growth is expected this year, the shortage of skilled workers is clouding the outlook.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said there were 7.14 million job openings in August. That was the highest level since the series started in 2000 and compared to 7.08 million vacancies in July. 
The increase in vacancies was concentrated in the finance, business and professional services, and healthcare sectors.
The job openings rate also rose to an all-time high of 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent in July. Hiring increased to a record high 5.78 million in August from 5.71 million in the prior month. That lifted the hiring rate to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in July.

""We have never had an economy turn down because it ran out of labor, but in the next couple of years, this will be the biggest risk to the economy's continued expansion,"" said MUFG's Rupkey. ""The manufacturing industry needs 488,000 workers right now to help them produce goods for America.""

Key Takeaways
October’s pickup in sentiment across the three sub-indexes and all four regions indicates the market for newly-built homes may be regaining steam after a broad cooling in housing in recent months. Tailwinds from tax cuts and one of the strongest job markets in decades continue to elevate sentiments and boost demand. Lumber prices have also fallen almost 50 percent since reaching a record in May.
At the same time, affordability continues to present challenges, with rising home prices and borrowing costs, the report said. Data on housing starts and existing-home sales due this week are both projected to show declines in September from the prior month.
Official’s View
“Favorable economic conditions and demographic tailwinds should continue to support demand, but housing affordability has become a challenge due to ongoing price and interest rate increases,” NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said in a statement. “Unless housing affordability stabilizes, the market risks losing additional momentum as we head into 2019.”

The Mannheim-based ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed its German economic sentiment fell to a negative 24.7 in October, matching the level seen in July which had been its lowest since 2012.
According to the Institute, the 14.1 point decline in the index was “remarkably strong”, surpassed only in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote when the UK decided to leave the EU. 
“Expectations for the German economy are dampening above all due to the intensifying trade dispute between the USA and China,” ZEW president Professor Achim Wambach explained, noting that negative expectations were beginning to impact German exports.
He added that additional negative influence on economic and export expectations could be seen from the “ever more likely” danger of a hard Brexit and a more unstable governing coalition in Germany.
According to the report, the deterioration in sentiment also spread to the wider euro zone which experienced a “very significant drop” to minus 19.4 points."

Earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by an annual 3.1 percent in the three months to August, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
That was higher than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Including bonuses, total earnings rose by 2.7 percent in the period, slightly above the poll's median forecast of 2.6 percent.
The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said last week that he saw signs of a ""new dawn"" for British wage growth.
Economists have been puzzled why wages were growing so slowly even as unemployment fell sharply.
Pay growth for Britain's workers slowed to as low as 0.5 percent in 2014. Despite the recent improvement it remains stuck below the 4 percent increases that were the norm before the global financial crisis.
The unemployment rate held at its four-decade low of 4.0 percent in the three months to August, the ONS said.
But the number of people in work fell by 5,000, the first fall in nearly a year. The Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rise of 11,000.
British households - whose spending is the main driver of the country's economy - have struggled for much of the past decade as their wages grew more slowly than inflation.
Data due on Wednesday is expected to show Britain's consumer price inflation stood at 2.6 percent in September, below a peak of 3.1 percent in November last year but still offering only modest improvement in spending power for workers.

The BoE said in August that it expected growth in total pay of 2.5 percent a year by the end of 2018, rising to 3.5 percent by the end of 2020, enough to justify the central bank's plan to gradually raise interest rates over the period.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 02:47AM ET</span>",U.S. government posts widest deficit since 2012,"By Jason Lange and Jonathan Spicer
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government closed the 2018 fiscal year $779 billion in the red, its highest deficit in six years, as Republican-led tax cuts pinched revenues and expenses rose on a growing national debt, according to data released on Monday by the Treasury Department.
New government spending also expanded the federal deficit for the 12 months through September, the first full annual budget on the watch of U.S. President Donald Trump. It was the largest deficit since 2012. 
The data also showed a $119 billion budget surplus in September, which was larger than expected and a record for the month. A senior Treasury official said the monthly surplus was smaller when adjusted for calendar shifts.
Economists generally view the corporate and individual tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress late last year and an increase in government spending agreed in early February as likely to balloon the nation's deficit.
Trump and his fellow Republicans have touted the tax cuts as a boost to growth and jobs.
“America’s booming economy will create increased government revenues – an important step toward long-term fiscal sustainability,"" Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said in a statement accompanying the data.
The deficit in the 12 months through September was $113 billion - or 17 percent - bigger than in the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for calendar effects, the gap was even larger, the Treasury official said. 
The Bipartisan Policy Center called the report ""a wake up call"" for policymakers to turn things around. ""The fact that our government is closing in on trillion-dollar deficits in the midst of an economic expansion should be a serious issue for voters and candidates,"" William Hoagland, its senior vice president, said of next month's U.S. congressional elections.
Much of the widening of the deficit came from more spending on interest payments on the national debt. Borrowing has increased over the past year, partially to make up for slower growth in tax revenues because of the tax cuts, while military spending has also risen. 
Adding debt servicing costs, the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates roughly once per quarter in the face of a hot labor market and some signs of inflation. Some Fed officials have warned that rising U.S. deficits could hamper any U.S. fiscal response to a downturn.
Trump has in turn criticized the Fed's monetary tightening, saying last week that the central bank had ""gone crazy.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - At week's end, global investors and policy makers will likely be given a stark reminder of the costs of a bitter Sino-U.S. trade war, with a Reuters poll predicting that China's third-quarter growth will slow to its weakest pace since the global financial crisis.
Domestic demand has been faltering in recent months as U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign to force China to make sweeping changes to intellectual property, industrial subsidy and trade policies start to depress export earnings. 
Beijing has been trying to ward off a sharper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy by stepping up policy support and softening its stance on a de-risking campaign, as the full impact of higher U.S. trade tariffs has still to be felt.
And analysts said more support measures will be needed as risks to China's growth outlook have increased since the second half of the year.
A poll of 68 economists showed gross domestic product likely grew 6.6 percent in July-September from a year earlier, slowing from the previous quarter's 6.7 percent and hitting the weakest pace since the first quarter of 2009.
The predicted third-quarter growth would still be higher than the government's full-year target of around 6.5 percent.
""The downward pressure on the economy is relatively big as consumption weakens and infrastructure investment has yet to stabilize"" from a slowdown, said Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai. 
""It's necessary to make policy adjustments as the external pressure increases."" 
Recent economic data have pointed to weakening domestic demand ranging from infrastructure investment to consumer spending, as a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending and debt has pushed up companies' borrowing costs. 
Growth in China's vast factory sector in September stalled after 15 months of expansion, with export orders falling the most in more than two years, according to private survey showed. An official survey also confirmed that manufacturers were coming under stress.
There are signs that firms have ramped up shipments before broader and stiffer U.S. tariffs take effect, which likely explains an unexpected acceleration in China's exports growth in September and a record trade surplus with the United States.
The yuan  has lost about 6 percent against the dollar this year, which may also have taken the sting out of the U.S. tariffs, but could fan risks of capital outflows.
Export-reliant Chinese cities and provinces are already showing the strain. Guangdong, China's biggest province by gross domestic product, reported a drop in exports in the first eight months from a year earlier.
The world's two biggest economies last slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's goods on Sept. 24, with Washington levying duties on about $200 billion of Chinese goods. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on virtually all of China's goods exports to the United States.
MORE POLICY SUPPORT SEEN LIKELY
Policymakers have in recent months unveiled measures to lower financing costs, cut taxes and fast-track more infrastructure projects, although analysts believe such modest stimulus may take time to put a floor under the slowing economy.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has cut reserve requirements for lenders four time this year, with the latest cut taking effect on Oct. 15, injecting more liquidity to stimulate bank lending. But the central bank faces obstacles in funneling more credit to cash-strapped small businesses, which are vital for boosting economic growth and creating jobs.
China's central bank governor Yi Gang said on Sunday he still sees plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), as downside risks from trade tensions with the United States remain significant.
China releases second quarter GDP on October 19, along with September industrial output, retail sales, property sales and investment, and fixed asset investment data.

Economists in the poll estimated GDP grew 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, versus 1.8 percent in the second quarter.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 11:23PM ET</span>",China's cooling factory-gate inflation signals waning demand,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate inflation cooled for a third straight month in September amid ebbing domestic demand, pointing to more pressure on the world's second biggest economy as it remains locked in an intensifying trade war with the United States.
Consumer inflation, on the other hand, picked up slightly in September from the previous month, led mainly by higher food prices, official data showed on Tuesday.
Overall, pricing pressures were contained, giving authorities the flexibility to ease monetary policy to shore up slowing growth. Over the weekend, central bank governor Yi Gang said he sees plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratio due to significant downside risks from the Sino-U.S. trade row. 
Indeed, economic activity has been slackening in the past few months, prompting the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to announce another cut to banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) just over a week ago - the fourth reduction this year.
For this year, Yi said that CPI will likely come in about 2 percent and expects PPI between 3-4 percent.
The producer price index (PPI), a gauge of industrial profitability, rose 3.6 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with a 4.1 percent increase in August, according to data released by the National Statistics Bureau on Tuesday.
On a monthly basis, the PPI picked up to 0.6 percent from 0.4 percent in August. 
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, noted that the small monthly rise in producer inflation mainly reflected an 'unsustainable"" increase in global oil price. 
""The bigger picture is that broader factory gate price pressures still appear to be cooling alongside weaker economic activity,"" he said in a client note following the data release.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected September producer inflation would cool to 3.5 percent as both external and domestic demand weakened.
Price inflation in non-metallic mineral resources, metal smelting, chemicals and coal mining all slowed in September from previous month, while extraction in oil and natural gas extended its gains. 
Raw materials prices rose 7.3 percent in September from a year earlier, down from a 7.8 percent increase in August, according to the statistics bureau. 
Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed to a five-month low in August, fanning concerns about faltering domestic demand.
The trade row with Washington appears to be already impacting industries. Growth in China's factory sector in September stalled after 15 months of expansion, with export orders falling the most in more than two years, a private business survey showed. An official survey also confirmed a further manufacturing weakening. 
CPI PICKUP
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, in line with expectations of 2.5 percent and accelerating from August' s 2.3 percent gain. It still remained comfortably below China's inflation goal of 3 percent for 2018, same as last year.
The food price index increased 3.6 percent in September, up sharply from the 1.7 percent annual gain in September, due to extreme weather conditions such as seasonal typhoons, heavy rains and hailstorms, according to the NBS.
Despite the pickup in the headline number, the core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.7 percent year-on-year, cooling from 2.0 percent's gain in August.
Gains in non-food prices also slowed to 2.2 percent from August's 2.5 percent. 
China's economic growth cooled slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter, though worries about a sharper slowdown in coming quarters have increased in recent months amid the rocky trade relations with the United States.
The two countries have already slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's goods, and U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States. 
If China goes ahead with a 15 percent tariff on $60 billion U.S. goods, it could lead to a one-time impact of a 0.2-0.3 percentage point gain on China's consumer inflation, according to estimates from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Yet, few expect the overall inflation picture to prevent further policy support for the economy. 

""The recent rise in CPI is due to temporary disruptions to food supply and is unlikely to prevent the People's Bank from loosening monetary policy further in the coming months in a bid to shore up economic growth,"" said Evans-Pritchard.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will soon host a huge trade fair to highlight its commitment to free trade and show off its willingness to import, but skeptical foreign businesses and diplomats say they want to see concrete policy changes to improve market access.
The China International Import Expo, announced by President Xi Jinping in 2017, is aimed at calming mounting foreign concern about China's trade practices and to signal its willingness to narrow its trade gap with the United States and others.
Authorities have been pulling out all the stops to ensure the success of the Nov. 5-10 trade fair in Shanghai.
But with a China-U.S. trade dispute deepening, sources familiar with the planning of the expo say that while many U.S. companies will attend, Washington is not planning to send any officials, though they have been invited.
The U.S. embassy in China declined to comment.
The ultimate value of the event - beyond propaganda points for China - will hinge on whether the government unveils substantial new market-opening policies, some foreign business people say.
But there are few signs any are imminent.
The expo was a ""broadly positive gesture"" that China wants to increase imports, said Ken Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.
""On the other hand, hurdles such as market access restrictions and non-tariff barriers continue to prevent companies from selling their products in China. Addressing those structural barriers are just as important, if not more so.""
The expo, which will fill an exhibition hall bigger than 35 soccer pitches, is one of the most important events on China's diplomatic calendar this year, with foreign officials and executives due to attend.
The Commerce Ministry and Shanghai government established new departments to organize and run it, and a special dispute resolution tribunal has been set up.
Chinese embassy staff around the world and officials at home have spent months pressing foreign businesses and governments to participate, according to diplomats and businessmen.
Two senior Western diplomats, one in Shanghai and one in Beijing, said they had even been told of oblique threats, but declined to give specific details.
""Things like: 'You've got a great business here. It'd be a pity if something happened to it' ... We've heard this from many, many companies,"" said one.
Others in the diplomatic and foreign business communities said they were not aware of such tactics.
Several people who have attended planning briefings say the government has promised that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and local government delegations would attend in force, ready to do deals.
""The SOEs have their marching orders to make big orders,"" the second senior diplomat familiar with the planning told Reuters.
The commerce ministry did not respond to a faxed request comment.
'OPPOSITE SIGNAL'
Few doubt that when the expo ends, China will point to import deals struck and declare it a success.
But that misses the point, said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
""If the purpose of this event is to suggest that China is more open, that it will import more and allow the market to function more independently, the steps that they are taking send the exact opposite signal,"" Kennedy said, referring to things like the pressing of companies to attend and of state enterprises to do deals.
""It is, again, reflective of how China and market economies talk past each other.""
Some foreign businessmen say they will turn up out of a sense of obligation - not doing so could be imprudent.
""We'll be there because we have to,"" said an official at a U.S. tech company who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Foreign officials and businesses are keeping their expectations in check.
""If you were to ask the average European business what they want from China to boost imports, it would be a long-term, transparent and predictable schedule of market opening and a leveling of the playing field,"" said a senior European diplomat.
""It wouldn't be an enormous trade fair.""
On trade policy, Xi's government has undertaken what Kennedy called ""tinkering with specific market access opportunities within the context of deep and extensive, unchanging intervention"".
That approach is unlikely to change.
Still, companies like Europe's biggest pork exporter, Danish Crown, will be there.
""Danish Crown is one of the very large exporters to China so we'll of course be there,"" said Soeren Tinggaard, vice president for Pork Export Strategy & Marketing.

""There will be signals from the government about 'how we're going to import more' and of course, we're going to be there to hear that.""

909,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales increase modestly; consumer spending strong,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales barely rose in September as a rebound in motor vehicle purchases was offset by the biggest drop in spending at restaurants and bars in nearly two years.
But other details of the report from the Commerce Department on Monday were upbeat and suggested that consumer spending ended the third quarter with strong momentum, which should provide a boost to economic growth despite anticipated drags from weak exports and a struggling housing market.
""The net result still appears to be a fairly strong quarter for consumer spending growth,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month after a similar gain in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0.6 percent in September. 
Retail sales in September rose 4.7 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.5 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, is being driven by a robust labor market, with the unemployment rate near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent. Tight labor market conditions are gradually pushing up wage growth. 
Consumption has also been supported by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut as well as higher savings. However, economists said the stimulus from the tax cuts was fading and many expected consumer spending to slow sharply in the fourth quarter. 
Some also worried a recent stock market sell-off had dented household wealth, which could hurt spending.
""We believe lower tax withholdings provided meaningful lift to consumer spending growth so far this year, but that the incremental support to growth from taxes should be fading,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""We look for a more meaningful deceleration (in consumer spending) in the fourth quarter.""
SOLID ECONOMIC GROWTH
Economists are estimating that consumer spending grew at an annualized rate of about 3.5 percent in the third quarter, which would be slightly below the 3.8 percent pace logged in the April-June period. Solid consumer spending should help to offset the impact on the economy from a widening trade deficit and persistent weakness in the housing market. 
Growth estimates for the third quarter are above a 3.0 percent rate. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter. Growth prospects for the July-September quarter were bolstered by a second report from the Commerce Department on Monday showing business inventories rose 0.5 percent in August after increasing 0.7 percent in July.
Inventory investment is expected to contribute to GDP growth after a liquidation of stocks sliced 1.17 percentage points from output in the April-June quarter.
Strong economic growth likely will keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank hiked rates last month for the third time this year. Tightening monetary policy has roiled financial markets in recent days. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower on Monday. The dollar was marginally weaker against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields rose. Last month, auto sales surged 0.8 percent after declining 0.5 percent in August. Receipts at clothing stores rebounded 0.5 percent after tumbling 2.8 percent in August. Online and mail-order sales soared 1.1 percent in September after rising 0.5 percent in the prior month. 
There were also strong increases in receipts at furniture, hobby, musical instrument and book stores as well as electronics and appliances outlets. But Americans cut back on spending at restaurants and bars, with sales dropping 1.8 percent. That was the biggest decline since December 2016 and followed a 0.3 percent rise in August. 
While the Commerce Department said it was impossible to determine the impact of Hurricane Florence on the data, disruptions caused by the storm could have hurt sales at restaurants and bars last month.
""Retail sales for food services and drinking places may have been impacted by the hurricane in September, as consumer confidence remained solid during the month,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. 

Sales at building material stores nudged up 0.1 percent in September. Receipts at service stations fell 0.8 percent, likely reflecting a moderation in gasoline prices.

Sales may have been hindered in part by Hurricane Florence, but the U.S. Census Bureau said it could not quantify the impact. The storm battered parts of the Atlanta seaboard, most notably the Carolinas.
The downbeat data dashed optimism over the health of the economy and raised questions about whether it slowed a bit toward the end of summer.
Retail sales increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, below expectations for a gain of 0.7% and following a rise of 0.1% in August.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.1%, disappointing forecasts for a gain of 0.4%. Core sales rose by a downwardly revised 0.3% in the preceding month.
Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report.
Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 08:26PM ET</span>","Japan manufacturers' mood rises, trade worries weigh on outlook: Reuters Tankan","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers rose in October from September and is expected to remain flat over the coming three months, a Reuters poll found, suggesting caution over the effect of global trade frictions on the economic outlook.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found non-manufacturers confidence sliding to its lowest in nearly two years as recent natural disasters hit consumers and some firms hard.
But the Reuters Tankan showed non-manufacturers' mood was expected to recover, endorsing market views that a hit from natural disasters should be temporary, although external risks to the outlook are mounting.
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 28, up two points from the previous month, led by metal products/machinery and textiles/paper, according to the survey taken Sept 27 to Oct 10. The index was seen to stay flat in January.
In the poll of 282 large- and mid-sized firms, in which 252 firms responded on condition of anonymity, managers complained about global trade tensions, rising raw materials prices and difficulty of passing on costs due to weak private consumption.
""Exchanges of hefty tariffs between the United States and China have raised input costs at our U.S. operations,"" a manager of a transport equipment firm wrote in the survey.
""The direct impact has been small at present but the future remains uncertain as we may need to shift production, depending on whether the United States will impose heavy tariffs against its imports from Japan.""
The non-manufacturers' index tumbled to 24 in October from 33 in the previous month, dragged down by the transport/utility and retail/wholesale sectors. The index was expected to bounce to 29 in January.
The BOJ's last tankan showed this month sentiment at big manufacturers soured in the September quarter to hit the lowest level in nearly a year, as firms faced rising raw material costs and a string of natural disasters that disrupted production.
The central bank's survey suggested that the specter of a full-blown global trade war weighed on companies' business outlook.
The International Monetary Fund this month cut Japan's economic growth forecast for 2018, warning that the country faced increased risks from uncertainty over global trade and the impact of a sales tax hike planned for next year.

Industrial production fell 0.5 percent in August from July, the national statistics agency said on Friday, its biggest drop since September last year.
Construction was down 2.9 percent, month-on-month, while utilities fell 1.3 percent. Mining was up 1 percent in August compared to July while manufacturing edged up 0.2 percent.
Industrial output overall was up 0.2 percent compared to the same month last year, the data showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices jumped faster than expected in September amid resurgent energy prices but prices excluding fuels were unchanged.
The Labor Department said on Friday import prices rose 0.5 percent last month. That was the largest increase since May and followed a revised 0.4 percent decrease in August.
Import prices were previously reported to have fallen 0.6 percent in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.2 percent in September.
In the 12 months through September, import prices rose 3.5 percent after a 3.8 percent increase in the 12 months through August.
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants rose 3.8 percent, the largest increase since May, after falling 2.2 percent in August. Food prices advanced 2 percent in September after rising 0.3 percent in the prior month. 
Excluding food and fuels, prices fell 0.1 percent in September. These so-called core prices fell 0.2 percent in August and were down in July and June as well. 
The weakness in core import prices likely reflects ongoing dollar strength. The dollar has gained more than 6 percent this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners. 
Dollar strength is expected to offset some of an anticipated increase in prices as the Trump administration presses ahead with tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports. 
U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on nearly $200 billion of Chinese imports last month and then threatened more levies if China retaliated. China then hit back with tariffs on about $60 billion of U.S. imports.
On Thursday, Trump warned there was much more he could do that would hurt China's economy.
U.S. Treasury yields briefly rose after the data. The dollar was trading slightly higher. 
The import price data excludes duties. In September, import prices for non-fuel industrial supplies and materials fell 0.4 percent after falling 0.9 percent in August. The cost of imported capital goods was unchanged.
Imported motor vehicle prices were also unchanged in September and have been virtually unchanged since May. The cost of consumer goods excluding automobiles fell 0.1 percent after being unchanged in August.
Prices for goods imported from China fell 0.1 percent in September for the third consecutive month. Prices for Chinese imports were up 0.4 percent in the 12 months through September. 
The report also showed export prices were unchanged in September after declining 0.2 percent in August. Prices for agricultural products fell 1.4 percent last month, with prices for oilseeds and grains falling 6.9 percent. 

Export prices rose 2.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in September after rising 3.5 percent in August.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's car sales fell the most in nearly seven years in September, stoking concerns the world's biggest auto market could contract for the first time in decades this year amid cooling economic growth and a biting trade war.
Vehicle sales slumped by 11.6 percent to 2.39 million units last month, the third straight decline, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Friday. It cited a sluggish economy, deleveraging and a tough pollution crackdown as reasons for the steep fall.
A stalling of China's giant auto sector will be a concern for the country's leaders in Beijing. It is a major driver of the economy and an important barometer of Chinese consumers' willingness to open their purse strings.
""The automotive industry has been a driver of China's economic growth for years. Now it is pulling back,"" Xu Haidong, CAAM assistant secretary general, said at a briefing in Beijing.
China's top auto industry body said its already meager forecast for full-year growth would be missed, though the market should avoid a sales decline. Analysts have predicted the market could contract this year for the first time since at least the early 1990s.
The downtrend in sales underscores how international car makers, from General Motors (N:GM) to Toyota Motor (T:7203), are in for a tough ride at a time when they are increasingly looking towards China as a driver of growth.
It also exemplifies the impact of the trade war, with autos being among the sectors hardest hit by tariffs. CAAM said last month sales were impacted by a sluggish economy and the knock-on effects of the trade war.
China's economic malaise has seen the domestic stock markets plunge and the country's factory sector stall last month after over a year of expansion. The International Monetary Fund also cut China's growth forecast for next year to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent.
Beijing, concerned about the slowdown, has already opened the taps to boost liquidity in the market.
The slide in September auto sales follows a 3.8 percent fall in August and a 4.0 percent drop in July. Vehicle sales increased 4.8 percent in June.
September's drop was the most since a 26.4 percent tumble in January 2012, which was in part due to the timing of the China New Year holiday that year.
Sales for the first nine months of the year totaled 20.49 million vehicles, up 1.5 percent from the same period a year earlier.
CAAM's Xu said that 2018 sales growth would miss the association's previous forecast of a 3 percent rise. Sales were also up 3 percent last year, but sharply down from a 13.7 percent gain in 2016.
Amid the slowdown, an army of Chinese car dealers is feeling the squeeze and is pushing for government support to revitalize growth.
Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said that if sales actually shrink this year it would be a ""watershed moment"" for the industry.
""It's very alarming and is even causing panic among some automakers and suppliers. That's because the market has been growing non-stop every year for more than twenty years, and those companies make plans based on growth,"" he said.
""They don't know what to do and worry about survival.""
WINNERS AND LOSERS
GM, one of the most successful global car makers in China for decades, said earlier this month that September sales were down a sharp 14.9 percent from a year earlier. German car maker Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said earlier this week that China sales were down 10.5 percent last month.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which has been struggling to turn around falling sales in the market, said on Friday that September sales in China were down 43 percent.
China's broader economic woes have led to a particular slowdown in the demand for cars in smaller, lower-tier cities across China, some car makers have said, which until now were the engine of growth for the country's auto industry.
Zhang of Automotive Foresight said that several factors had combined to cause this, including high gas prices this year which had stymied growth in lower-tier cities.
The industry is also facing a shake-up as decades-old rules change to allow foreign car makers to own majority stakes in local joint ventures. Luxury German car maker BMW (DE:BMWG) said on Thursday it would take control of its main China venture in a $4.2 billion deal.
The changing auto landscape is throwing up distinct winners and losers in the market, a major shift from the golden years of growth where most players were guaranteed decent returns.
Among those struggling in China the most are  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and its sister brand Kia Motors (KS:000270), Ford and Japanese car maker Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267).
Sales of new-energy vehicles – a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles – remained strong, up 54.8 percent in September, slightly faster than a month earlier.

That took new-energy vehicle sales in the first nine months of this year to 721,000 vehicles, up 81.1 percent from the same period a year earlier.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 01:41AM ET</span>","China September exports surge, creating record surplus with U.S. despite tariffs","By Elias Glenn and Stella Qiu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's vast export engine unexpectedly kicked into higher gear in September, producing a record trade surplus with the United States that could exacerbate the already-heated dispute between Beijing and Washington.
Analysts said last month's strong export growth - which might indicate U.S. tariffs are not biting much yet - is unlikely to be sustained.
But the robust numbers reported on Friday by China's customs agency - the last ones from China before U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6 - could prompt a reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump.
September exports rose 14.5 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace since February, the customs data showed. That was well above August's 9.8 percent and a Reuters poll forecast of 8.9 percent. 
""The big picture is the Chinese exports have so far held up well in the face of escalating trade tensions and cooling global growth, most likely thanks to the competitiveness boost provided by a weaker renminbi,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""With global growth likely to cool further in the coming quarters and US tariffs set to become more punishing, the recent resilience of exports is unlikely to be sustained.""
YUAN DEPRECIATION
A weaker yuan , which has depreciated about 6 percent against the dollar this year, may have taken the sting out of the tariffs imposed on $250 billion of exports to the United States. 
Despite concerns from some officials about the yuan's depreciation, U.S. Treasury staff have not recommended labeling China as a currency manipulator in a coming report on foreign exchange rate practices, according to media reports on Thursday.
China's politically-sensitive surplus with the U.S. was $34.13 billion in September, surpassing the record of $31.05 billion in August.
Beijing's export data has been surprisingly resilient to tariffs, possibly because companies ramped up shipments before broader and stiffer U.S. duties went into effect, raising concerns about a sharper drop in export strength once all tariffs kick in. 
""The front-loading impact is quite obvious to me,"" said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong. 
She cited a jump in exports of electrical machinery - the biggest export item from China to the U.S. - as a sign exporters might have pushed out shipments ahead of implementation of the latest tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese exports.
'FURTHER DOWNSIDE RISK' 
Along with electrical machinery, exports for textiles, furniture and chips all rose faster than in the previous month, the customs data showed. 
""If that’s the case then I think further downside risk can be expected in the fourth quarter,"" Wang said.
Li Kuiwen, a spokesman from the country's customs agency, also told reporters trade growth may slow somewhat in the fourth quarter. 
The world's two biggest economies last slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's goods on Sept. 24. There is no specific date set for the next round of tariffs, even as Trump has made repeated threats to impose them on virtually all Chinese goods.
China's exports to the U.S. continued to rise at a double- digit clip in September compared with a year earlier, while imports fell for the first time since February. 
Over the first nine months of the year, China's surplus with its largest export market totaled $225.79 billion, compared with about $196.01 billion in the same period last year.
Growth in overall imports for September instead showed a moderate slowdown, in line with signs the broad cooling in domestic demand.
Imports rose 14.3 percent in September, versus a 19.9 percent gain in August, slightly missing analysts' forecast of a 15.0 percent growth.
Iron ore imports rose to their highest level in four months as steel mills ramped up output ahead of winter production restrictions.
FEELING HEAT 
For trade with all countries, China logged a surplus of $31.69 billion for September, compared with forecasts in a Reuters poll for $19.4 billion and August's surplus of $27.89 billion. 
China's economy is feeling some heat from tariff dispute and signs of slowing that prompted the central bank on Sunday to loosen policy by cutting banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for a fourth time this year.
Growth in China's factory sector in September stalled after 15 months of expansion, with export orders falling the most in more than two years, a private business survey showed. An official survey also confirmed a further manufacturing weakening.
To shore up growth, Beijing has pledged to increase export tax rebates from Nov. 1 for the second time this year and promised to cut corporate burden on a larger scale to help struggling Chinese firms.
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for this year and next, saying that the U.S-China trade war was taking a toll. It also slashed China's growth forecast for next year to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent.

China will cut import tariffs on a wide range of goods beginning on Nov. 1, as part of Beijing's pledge to take steps to increase imports this year amid rising tension.

The September surplus with the U.S. was larger than China's overall trade surplus of $31.69 billion for the month.
For January-September, China's trade surplus with the United States was $225.79 billion, compared with about $196.01 billion in the same period last year.
China's large trade surplus with the United States has long been a sore point with Washington and is at the center of an increasing bitter dispute between the world's two biggest economies.

Borrowing costs on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held home loan type in the United States, averaged 4.90 percent in the week ended Oct. 11, which was the highest since the week of April 14, 2011, the mortgage finance agency said.
The latest figure was up from 4.71 percent the week before and 3.91 percent a year ago, it said.
On Tuesday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) rose to 3.261 percent, the highest since May 2011, as investors pared their bond holdings on worries about rising inflation and a faster pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
The increase in mortgage rates, while still low by historic standards, is another headwind for the housing sector, which is already struggling from low home inventory and rising building costs, analysts said. [nL2N1WC131]
“Rising rates paired with high and escalating home prices is putting downward pressure on purchase demand,"" Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, said in a statement.
""While the monthly payment remains affordable due to the still low mortgage rate environment, the primary hurdle for many borrowers today is the down payment and that is the reason home sales have decreased in many high-priced markets,” he added.
As for other types of home loans, 15-year mortgage rates averaged 4.29 percent, up from 4.15 percent a week earlier and 3.21 percent the year before.
The interest rates on five-year adjustable mortgages averaged 4.07 percent, up from 4.01 percent the prior week and 3.16 percent a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in September, held back by a slower increase in the cost of rent and falling energy prices, as underlying inflation pressures appeared to cool slightly. 
The modest price increases come despite a U.S. labor market that looks robust by most measures. A separate report on Thursday showed an unexpected but moderate rise in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week.
With the readings only slightly below what analysts expected, the inflation report is not likely to impact expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its December policy meeting.
""Overall, these data support our baseline view of a gradual pickup in inflationary pressures,"" Oxford Economics said in a note to clients.
The Consumer Price Index increased 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in August, the Labor Department said. In the 12 months through September, the CPI increased 2.3 percent, slowing from August's 2.7 percent advance. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent for the second straight month. The so-called core index had increased 0.2 percent in May, June and July.
In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 2.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast both overall and core CPI climbing 0.2 percent in September.
U.S. Treasury yields extended their fall as the data added to the view that a sell-off in U.S. and global stocks may have partly paused expectations of a more aggressive pace of Fed rate hikes. The dollar weakened to a nearly two-week low against a basket of currencies.
TRUMP CRITICISM
The Fed tracks a different inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 2.0 percent in the 12 months through August, holding at the Fed's 2 percent target for the fourth straight month. 
The U.S. central bank has raised rates three times this year, and U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called the rate increases a ""ridiculous"" policy. It was the second consecutive day that Trump had criticized the Fed.
Last month, gasoline prices slipped 0.2 percent after surging 3.0 percent in August. Food prices were flat overall and prices for food consumed at home fell 0.1 percent.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.2 percent in September after rising 0.3 percent in August. Rental prices for primary residences rose 0.2 percent, down from a 0.4 percent increase in August.
Separately, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Oct. 6. While analysts had expected a slight decline, the reading still remained near a 49-year low.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,500 to 209,500 last week.

The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment, which many economists believe is helping U.S. wages grow a little more quickly and fueling expectations of future rate increases.

WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week but remained near a 49-year low, and the increase appeared unlikely to dislodge the view that the U.S. labor market remains strong.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Oct. 6, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 206,000 in the latest week from 207,000 a week earlier. 
The Labor Department said claims for South and North Carolina were affected by Hurricane Florence, which lashed the region in mid-September. The department also said claims for Virginia and Puerto Rico were estimated.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,500 to 209,500 last week.
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment, which many economists believe is helping U.S. wages grow a little more quickly and fueling expectations the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates again in December. 
The Fed has already raised rates three times this year.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 4,000 to 1.66 million for the week ended Sept. 29. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims decreased 10,000 to 1.66 million, the lowest level since August 1973.

The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1% last month, compared to expectations for a gain of 0.2%.
In the 12 months through September, inflation rose 2.3%, below forecasts for a reading of 2.4% and down from 2.7% in August.
Core CPI, a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.1% from a month earlier, below forecasts for a gain of 0.2%. The annual increase in the core CPI was 2.2%. Economists had forecast an increase of 2.3%.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Recent solid U.S. economic reports and an upbeat assessment of the economy from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have triggered expectations for a faster-than-expected pace of rate hikes from the Fed.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for what would be the fourth time this year at its December meeting and has planned three further rate hikes in 2019.
U.S. Treasury yields started to climb last week amid expectations for higher interest rates. The rise in Treasury yields, along with fears over slowing global growth and trade tensions, sparked a selloff that led to Wall Street’s worst daily loss in eight months on Wednesday.
The sharp falls on Wall Street prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to renew his recent criticism of the Fed, calling it “crazy” for its plans to continue hiking rates."
921,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 08:06AM ET</span>",ECB's rising growth fears not enough to derail policy: minutes,"By Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Global trade tensions could slow euro zone growth further and European Central Bank policymakers debated last month whether to downgrade their risk assessment, minutes of their September meeting showed on Thursday.
But policymakers ultimately concluded that the domestic economy was showing enough resilience to consider risks broadly balanced, even if some argued that the factors behind the recent slowdown may not be temporary as earlier thought, the ECB said in the accounts of the Sept 13 meeting.
The ECB kept policy unchanged as expected last month, staying on track to wrap up a 2.6 trillion-euro ($3 trillion)bond purchases scheme this year and raise interest rates next autumn, continuing its slow but steady pace of policy tightening..
Indeed, even as trade tensions weighed on growth and a stock market selloff amplified growth fears, some policymakers argued that was not enough for the bank to backtrack on policy normalization. 
""A gradual pace of monetary policy normalization is justified,"" Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said in Indonesia on Thursday. ""The current strength of the euro area economy supports our confidence that inflation will converge toward ... the ECB's price stability target."" 
But some policymakers appear to be increasingly cautions, according to the minutes.
""A remark was made that some of the factors behind the (downward growth) revisions might not be entirely of a transitory nature,"" the minutes showed. ""It was also argued that there could be larger spillovers from weaker external demand to domestic demand."" 
Still, while some policymakers argued that the case could be made for downgrading the risk assessment, there was agreement that the underlying strength of the economy would mitigate the downside risks to activity.
""High-frequency indicators had stabilized and remained at elevated levels, underlining the overall robustness of economic activity,"" chief economist Peter Praet told policymakers at the meeting, the minutes showed.
With years of unprecedented stimulus finally lifting inflation, the ECB has been dialing back support, but only by the smallest of increments, fearing that bigger moves risked unraveling its work. 
While the ECB has not explicitly pledged any rate hikes, policymakers, including Praet, have argued that they were comfortable with market expectation for a small increase in the fourth quarter of 2019, followed by only small and infrequent moves.
""To be any more precise than that, to lock in a date, to tie our hands, would be rather risky,"" Ardo Hansson, Estonia's central bank chief said at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund on Thursday.
""When we get closer, we can have another discussion if we need to adjust the language again, but this is not a debate we are going to have just yet,"" Hansson said.

Policymakers also concluded last month that domestic cost pressures continued to build and broaden, indicating that inflation would rise, moving back toward the bank's target of almost 2 percent after undershooting it for over five years.

“We’re confident that we can weather the storms but we’re not complacent,” Dominguez said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Bali on Thursday, when asked about inflation. “Definitely, rising interest rates will have a detrimental effect on our growth prospects but we’re still expecting around 6.5 percent growth for the whole year.”
Economic growth slowed to a three-year low of 6 percent in the second quarter, with the government set to report third-quarter data on Nov. 8. The Philippines is battling surging prices and a weakening currency that’s forced the central bank to raise interest rates by 150 basis-points since May.
Dominguez, a member of the central bank’s Monetary Board, said future actions will depend on the data. Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo on Wednesday said policy makers are ready to tighten monetary policy further if needed.
“We will act appropriately depending on what the data shows,” Dominguez said. “If more aggressive actions are required, we will take it. If not, we will ease off.”
Higher tax revenue and “a tremendous amount” of loans from China, Japan and South Korea will help the Philippines fund its infrastructure program that’s counted on to cushion the economy from risks such as the trade war, Dominguez said. The Philippines had aspired for a 7 percent to 8 percent growth this year, which is no longer attainable, according to at least two economic officials.
Shock Absorber
Inflation accelerated to 6.7 percent in September, the fastest pace in more than nine years. The peso has lost about 8 percent this year, among the worst performers in Asia. The benchmark stock index is heading for its lowest level since December 2016 after a record streak of foreigners’ withdrawals.
The government is comfortable with the current level of the peso as it absorbs shocks, Dominguez said. “We don’t want these pressures to build up and not be reflected in the interest rates or the exchange rate,” he said.
The government has enough funds and can afford to continue rejecting bids from investors seeking higher rates on bills and bonds, Dominguez said.
The Bureau of the Treasury had sold just about half of the 90 billion pesos ($1.7 billion) of government securities offered in September, as banks sought higher yields. The government is turning to global investors with a plan to sell $1.5 billion of dollar bonds and up to $500 million of debt denominated in euros or Swiss francs.

LONDON (Reuters) - British surveyors are the most downbeat about house prices since the Brexit vote in 2016 with some unsettled by reports that Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned ministers of a possible house price crash if Britain leaves the EU with no deal.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said its headline house price balance fell to a four-month low of -2 in September, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll.
The outlook for prices in three and 12 months' time was the lowest since June 2016.
""Uncertainty relating to Brexit negotiations is at the very top of the list followed by references to the confidential remarks made by the Bank of England Governor to the cabinet,"" RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
Last month British media reported Carney privately told ministers that mortgage rates could spiral and house prices fall by 35 percent over three years in a chaotic no-deal Brexit.
The BoE declined to comment on the remarks and whether Carney had been referring to extreme financial scenarios used for previous BoE tests of banks' financial health.
Carney himself did not address the reports in a public appearance on the day they appeared, but reiterated that the BoE had tested banks against ""very severe"" scenarios including ""dramatic house price falls"".
Britain's housing market overall has slowed since the Brexit vote in June 2016. Official data for July showed prices up 3 percent on the year compared to gains of around 8 percent at the time of the referendum.
The headline figure masks big regional variations. Prices are falling in London, which saw the biggest rises before the Brexit vote. The city is vulnerable to Brexit worries among foreign investors and any barriers to financial services trade.
By contrast, RICS said prices continued to rise in most of the United Kingdom outside London and neighboring areas.

Sales were slow almost everywhere, however. New buyer enquiries were the weakest since March and houses were taking the longest to sell since RICS started asking its members about this regularly in February 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased 0.2 percent in September, in line with expectations, while a revision to wholesale inventory estimates for August showed the biggest jump in nearly five years, beating forecasts.
A rise in services prices offset a slight drop in prices for goods, including a 3.5 percent drop in gasoline prices. Final demand prices had fallen 0.1 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the producer price index rose 2.6 percent, slightly less than expected.
It was the first monthly rise in the producer price index since June. Yields on Treasury bonds rose to session highs while the dollar fell. U.S. stocks were trading lower.
Data on producer prices feed into inflation indicators watched by the Federal Reserve, which has been raising rates in hopes of keeping a price index based on personal consumption expenditures near the central bank's 2 percent target. 
The Fed raised rates last month for the third time this year and is expected to do so again in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI increasing 0.2 percent in September and advancing 2.8 percent year-on-year.
The rise in wholesale inventories was slightly above the 0.8 percent expected by analysts. The component of inventories that feeds into estimates of gross domestic product growth rose 0.7 percent.
After declining inventories subtracted more than a percentage point from GDP growth in the April-June quarter, economists expect investments in inventories to support GDP going forward.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.4 percent last month, the largest increase since January. The so-called core PPI had risen 0.1 percent in August.
In the 12 months through September, the core PPI rose 2.9 percent, the same as the month before. 
The cost of services rose 0.3 percent last month, reversing two months of declines, and driven by a 1.8 percent jump in transportation and warehousing services. Over one third of the increase in services was attributed to a 5.5 percent increase in the index for airline passenger services. 
The index measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services had fallen 0.1 percent in August. 
The slight decline in goods prices was the first since May 2017, led by a 0.8 percent drop in energy prices and a 0.6 percent drop in food. Excluding food and energy, goods prices rose 0.2 percent.
The report also hinted at the ongoing impact of the Trump administration's trade policies. Prices for oilseeds fell 3.9 percent from August to September. Soybeans have been the target of trade actions by China in retaliation for U.S. imposed tariffs.
Prices for steel mill products were unchanged month over month, but have risen 18 percent since September 2017. Trump imposed a 25 percent levy on imported steel in the spring.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: German government cuts growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 - document,"By Gernot Heller and Rene Wagner
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government has cut its forecasts for growth this year and next in Europe's largest economy and sees an escalation in the global trade dispute as the main risk for the future, a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.
The government - due to present its updated forecasts on Thursday - slashed its 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts to 1.8 percent, compared with its previous predictions of 2.3 percent and 2.1 percent respectively, the document showed.
It blamed weak global trade, reduced state consumption, revisions to previously reported data and slower production in the auto sector due to difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard.
Risks for the German economy include Britain's looming departure from the European Union and threat of economic crises in Turkey and Argentina spreading to other emerging economies, the document showed.
The German government expects the economy to expand by 1.8 percent in 2020, the document showed.
It said domestic demand remained strong but that the global economic environment was increasingly difficult.
Traditionally driven by exports, the German economy - now in its ninth year of expansion - relies heavily on household spending to grow as consumers enjoy record-high employment, rising real wages, strong job security and low borrowing costs.
Due to an increasingly tight labor market, characterized by low unemployment and more than a million job vacancies, the government expects nominal wages to rise by 3.0 percent this year and by 3.1 percent in both 2019 and 2020.
With inflation, predicted to rise to 1.9 percent this year and 2.0 percent in 2019, the wage hikes mean that German consumers will have more money to spend also in real terms.
""In view of the strong expansion of disposable income and moderate inflation, private consumption is likely to pick up noticeably,"" the document said.
Household spending is projected to grow by 1.6 percent in 2018 and by 2.0 percent in 2019.
Provisional budgeting in the first half of this year caused by an unusually long coalition building period means that state spending will be postponed into next year, it said.

State consumption is projected to rise by 1.4 percent this year and by 2.5 percent next while state investments are seen jumping by 5.9 percent in 2018 and by 5.2 percent in 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British economy's summer surge turned out to be stronger than expected as hot weather spurred consumer spending, although a weak August hinted at slower growth ahead of Brexit next year, data showed on Wednesday.
The economy expanded 0.7 percent during the three months to August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, beating the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists for growth of 0.6 percent.
While Wednesday's data is likely to come as a pleasant surprise to Bank of England officials who had expected to see slower growth over the third quarter, they will be more cautious about the coming months.
More recent private-sector business surveys point to fairly modest economic growth, suggesting the hot weather may have been a factor behind the upturn seen over the summer months.
In August alone the economy stagnated, the ONS said, compared with forecasts for a rise of 0.1 percent.
""We think there is a very real risk that growth will slow markedly in the fourth quarter due to appreciable Brexit and political uncertainties weighing down on business investment,"" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club consultancy, said.
Britain's economy slowed after the June 2016 Brexit vote, its growth rate slipping from top spot among the Group of Seven rich nations to jostling with long-term laggards Japan and Italy for bottom place in the rankings.
Consumers in particular were squeezed by the jump in inflation which followed the pound's tumble after the referendum, especially as wages have failed to keep up.
That said, in recent months an unusually warm summer and the soccer World Cup encouraged many to splash out on drinks and pub and restaurant visits.
""The economy continued to rebound strongly after a weak spring with retail, food and drink production and housebuilding all performing particularly well during the hot summer months,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
""However, long-term growth continues to lag behind its historical trend.""
In year-on-year terms, growth slowed in August to 1.5 percent from 1.7 percent in July.
A flat August for the economy came despite a solid rise in oil and gas output, which reflected a smaller-than-usual amount of maintenance taking place in production sites. Manufacturing output, however, contracted and there was no growth in the services industry.

Separate trade data showed Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world touched a three-month high in August, despite the smallest gap in EU goods trade since September 2015.

The Office of National Statistics said the economy grew 0.7% in the three months to August, picking up from the 0.6% expansion seen in the three months to July.
The report noted that wholesale and retail trade showed strong growth, in part due to warmer than usual weather in the summer months.
“The economy continued to rebound strongly after a weak spring, with retail, food and drink production and housebuilding all performing particularly well during the hot summer months. However, long-term growth continues to lag behind its historical trend,” ONS head of GDP Rob Kent-Smith said.
Month-on-month, GDP was flat, falling short of forecasts for an expansion of 0.1%, but growth in the previous month was revised up to 0.4% from a previously reported 0.1%.
The ONS has warned that the monthly data can be volatile and is subject to revisions.
The report said the services sector was the largest contributor to growth at 0.42%. The services sector grew by 1.6% in June to August 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly rose in August after robust gains in the previous month in a sign that capital spending is set to grow as companies invest in new equipment and software to manage labor shortages.
The 6.8 percent increase in core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, compared with the median estimate for a 4.0 percent decline in a Reuters poll.
In July core orders rose 11.0 percent, the fastest increase since January 2016.
Japanese companies' capital expenditure plans remain strong for the current fiscal year, a Bank of Japan tankan survey showed last week, as companies increase investment in automation and labour-saving technologies.
The trade war between the United States and China poses a risk to the outlook because it could indirectly reduce sales from China, making some Japanese manufacturers less likely to buy new equipment.
""Japanese companies are following through on their bullish capital expenditure plans,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""There were concerns that companies would reign in capital expenditure due to worries about trade friction, but this isn't happening. Capex will continue to rise as long as trade friction doesn't become more intense than it is now.""
Orders from manufacturers rose 6.6 percent in August, following an 11.8 percent increase in the previous month, due to increased orders from auto manufacturers and the steel sector.
Service-sector orders rose 6.0 percent in August, versus a 10.9 percent increase in the previous month as orders from companies in freight shipping. 
Orders from financial services companies also rose as they install automatic reception systems because of labor shortages.
The Cabinet Office upgraded its assessment of machinery orders, saying they are in recovery.
Big companies plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4 percent in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019, the BOJ's tankan survey for September showed last week, a shade lower than the previous tankan's 13.6 percent increase. 
But the International Monetary Fund cut its forecasts on Tuesday for global economic growth, partially due to the Sino-U.S. trade war.
Japanese manufacturers are sensitive to developments in global trade because they export large numbers of machines and parts to China where they are used to make finished goods for the United States and other markets.

Machinery orders from overseas rose 7.8 percent in August, faster than a 6.0 percent increase in the previous month, which may temporarily ease concerns about export demand.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 03:37AM ET</span>",Weak German trade suggests meager growth in third quarter,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports unexpectedly fell in August, data showed on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that manufacturers in Europe's largest economy shifted into a lower gear over the summer months.
The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports edged down by 0.1 percent on the month, missing a Reuters forecast of a 0.3 percent rise. Imports dropped by 2.7 percent, undershooting a predicted 0.2 percent fall.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski blamed the low trade volumes over the summer months on a general weakening of global manufacturing activity and a temporary blip in domestic demand.
""The traditional German growth engine is stuttering once again,"" Brzeski said, in reference to exports. ""Luckily, the German economy is no longer running on one or two cylinders but still has solid domestic demand to lean on. At least for now.""
Household spending has become an important growth driver in Germany as consumers are reaping the benefits of record employment levels, rising real wages, increased job security and cheap credit due to the euro zone's expansive monetary policy.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to 18.3 billion euros ($21.0 billion) in August from 15.9 billion in the previous month, the data showed.
Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 15.3 billion euros from 15.1 billion euros in July, unadjusted data showed.
The trade figures chimed with data released on Monday that showed industrial output edging down unexpectedly in August, suggesting the German economy lost steam in the third quarter. 
Volker Treier from the DIHK chambers of industry and commerce said the weak data meant that he would probably have to cut his forecast for 5 percent export growth this year.
""Exports are stagnating. And the worst is probably yet to come. In particular, the trade conflict between China and the United States will leave its mark in the coming 12 months,"" he said. ""German companies are too interconnected in the global economy, especially with these two countries, to be free from it.""
Economists are taking an increasingly pessimistic view of the German economy, with the top German institutes last month revising down their 2018 growth forecast and warning that an escalation of trade friction involving the United States could cause a major recession in Germany and Europe.
A source has also told Reuters that the government will revise down its growth forecasts for this year and next. The government is expected to announce its updated growth projections on Thursday.

Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said last month the economy would grow by around 2.0 percent this year, plus or minus 0.1 percent. Last year, Germany's gross domestic product expanded by a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent, the strongest rate since 2011.

Daily inflation is now 4 percent, according to opposition legislator Angel Alvarado, with monthly inflation rising to 233 percent in September from 223 percent in August.
In an effort to stabilize prices, President Nicolas Maduro in August cut five zeros off the ailing bolivar currency, boosted the minimum wage by 3,000 percent, and pegged salaries to an elusive state-backed cryptocurrency.
Opposition legislators have become the only source for economic indicators after the central bank stopped publishing such information nearly three years ago as the economy began unraveling.
The International Monetary Fund estimates consumer prices would rise 1,000,000 percent in 2018.
Maduro was re-elected in May in a vote that dozens of foreign governments described as rigged.

He insists the election was free and fair and says the situation is the result of an ""economic war"" led by the opposition and business leaders who are arbitrarily raising prices.

Shops reported total spending edged up by an annual 0.7 percent last month, the slowest rise since October last year apart from a slump in April which was distorted by the timing of the Easter holiday, the British Retail Consortium said.
A broader measure of consumer spending by Barclaycard (L:BARC) increased by the smallest amount in five months, rising by an annual 3.9 percent.
""We've seen spending return to a more modest level as consumers balance their budgets after a longer than usual summer of spend,"" Esme Harwood, a Barclaycard director, said.
Household consumption accounts for about 60 percent of Britain's economy. The Bank of England and other forecasters have been surprised by its strength since the Brexit vote in 2016, even as pay growth has lagged behind inflation. 
The propensity of consumers to spend has helped to soften a slowdown in the overall economy.
But there have been signs that after a summer heatwave and the soccer World Cup, households have turned a bit more cautious. The BoE last week reported the weakest increase in borrowing by consumers in nearly three years.
Nearly half of the consumers surveyed by Barclaycard -- 46 percent -- were planning to spend less on Christmas this year than they did in 2017, she said. 

The BRC data showed that on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the effect of changes in store space, retail sales fell 0.2 percent in September, the first non-Easter decline since October last year.

Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to 11.4 from 12 points in September. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a dip to 11.7.
A sub-index measuring expectations rose slightly to -8.3 from -8.8. A sub-index on current conditions fell to 33 from 35, hitting its lowest level since April 2017.
""The cause of the slight fall in the index probably lies in the discussion about the auto sector in Germany and uncertainties over the future fiscal policy of the Italian government,"" Manfred Huebner, managing director of Sentix, said.
German carmakers and the government hashed out a compromise deal to cut pollution from diesel vehicles last week after environmental groups won a victory in February which allowed cities to ban older diesel cars.
The government has asked carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes. Not all carmakers committed to the retrofits, as the hardware fixes are known, which would cost billions of euros and eat into profit margins.
Investors also worry about Italy, where the government is so far defying the European Commisison's calls to bring the planned budget deficits down, in line with EU rules.
A separate index gauging investor morale in Germany rose in October despite rising pressure on its large automotive sector to cough up cash for expensive retrofits for older diesel models and concerns about the stability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.
Merkel's coalition, which includes her Christian Democrats, their Bavarian allies and the center-left Social Democrats, has been shaken by disputes over immigration and the scandal-hit chief of the domestic spy agency.
""Despite the negative discussions about the car industry and the question mark hanging over the survival of the governing coalition, German economic data remains stable,"" Huebner said.
""The economy is cooling down but a recession is still not in sight,"" he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output dipped unexpectedly in August for the third time in as many months, data showed on Monday, suggesting Europe's largest economy lost steam in the third quarter.
Data from the Economy Ministry showed industrial output fell 0.3 percent in August, confounding a Reuters forecast for a rise of 0.4 percent. It followed a fall of 1.3 percent in July, itself a downward revision of an earlier, stronger number.
Jennifer McKeown, economist at Capital Economics, said the weak reading, combined with a recent downturn in retail sales, indicated the economy had not sustained its strong start to the year.
""August's 0.3 percent fall in German industrial production is much weaker than expected and suggests that the economy is very unlikely to match the second quarter's 0.5 percent expansion in the third quarter,"" she said.
Economists are taking an increasingly pessimistic view of the German economy, with the top German institutes last month revising down their 2018 growth forecast and warning that an escalation of trade friction involving the United States could cause a major recession in Germany and Europe.
A source has also told Reuters that the government will revise down its growth forecasts for this year and next. The government is expected to announce its updated growth projections on Thursday.
CONSTRUCTION WOBBLE
A breakdown of the output data showed construction activity tumbled by 1.8 percent while factories churned out 0.7 percent fewer capital goods. But output of consumer goods and energy were bright spots.
The ministry said one reason for the weaker data was slower production in the auto sector related to difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard - the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).
""With a large order backlog and incoming orders picking up again, the industrial upturn will probably continue again soon, especially as the bottleneck for the registration of cars according to the WLTP standard is gradually clearing,"" it said.
In the less volatile two-month comparison comparing July/August with May/June, production tumbled by 1.8 percent.
""The slowdown of the German industry continues,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, adding the sector had undergone a deflationary phase in the first eight months of the year.
But he added that it was too early to lose hope, adding: ""Too often has there been a surge in industrial (and economic) activity in Germany after the summer vacation.""
Data on Friday had shown industrial orders rebounding in August as an auto sector bottleneck cleared and deals with customers outside Europe picked up sharply.

Other recent data has shown growth in the manufacturing sector slowing and the Ifo institute's monthly survey showed business sentiment improved in all sectors other than manufacturing.

936,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>","China services sector expands in September, but costs up and employment shrinks: Caixin PMI","BEIJING, (Reuters) - China's services sector grew at its fastest clip in three months in September on improved demand, a private survey showed on Monday, though sentiment worsened as firms started shedding jobs after over two years of expansion while rising cost pressures pointed to a squeeze on profit margins.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 53.1 in September from 51.5 in August, and staying above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
The faster growth is a welcome signal for a key part of the world's second-largest economy as it faces rising headwinds from a heated trade row with the United States. 
An official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector for last month published on Sept 30 also pointed to continued expansion, which analysts say was largely driven by a jump in construction in a sign the government's fiscal easing may be gaining traction.
Monday's survey showed most of the pick-up came from higher new business orders, as the sub-index rose at its quickest pace in three months with a reading of 52.4, compared to 51.7 in August. 
China is counting on services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to lessen the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment. Policymakers have also quickened project approvals lately to prop up infrastructure investment growth.
Strength in the services sector would alleviate some pains already felt by China's manufacturing sector from the impact of U.S. tariffs. Factory activity stalled in September after 15 months of expansion, with export orders falling the fastest in over two years, a separate Caixin survey just over a week ago.
Government statistics show the services sector, accounting for slightly over half of China's economy in the first half of 2018, grew 7.6 percent in that period from a year earlier, easily outpacing overall GDP growth of 6.8 percent.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Monday, rose marginally to 52.1 in September from 52.0 in August. 
ABRUPT EMPLOYMENT LOSS
While the uptick in the services activity could be a relief for Chinese policymakers battling a protracted trade war with the United States, an abrupt employment contraction in the sector may signal emerging stress. 
""What we should be wary of is that overall employment contracted in September,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the data release. 
The employment sub-index fell to 49 in September, marking its first contraction since July 2016, and the lowest level since March that year, leading to a slight pullback in business expectations for the next 12 months. 
China's state planner has said trade dispute with the United States created uncertainty for its job market, while finance minister Liu Kun also told Reuters he is highly concerned about potential job losses. 
Beyond trade shocks, China's state-led deleveraging campaign, as part of Beijing's resolve to reduce financial risks from years of reckless debt build-up, has also hurt some regional governments and companies' ability to finance new projects and pay off debt interests.
""The deterioration in employment will test policymakers' determination in pressing ahead with reforms,"" Zhong added.
Service companies may have felt a profit squeeze in September as prices charged fell for the first time in 13 months while input price inflation picked up to their highest since January. 

Companies reported greater fuel, raw material and salary costs in the month, the survey showed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's businesses are suffering from Brexit-related uncertainty as exports slow, recruitment difficulties mount and investment plans are scaled back, two surveys showed on Monday.
The British Chambers of Commerce said its survey of 5,600 companies, the largest of its kind in Britain, showed services firms were having the most trouble finding staff since the survey began in 1989, and growth in factory exports was the slowest since late 2016.
""These figures reinforce what we are hearing from businesses up and down the country -- the uncertainty over Brexit, and the lack of bold moves to boost business at home, are starting to bite,"" BCC director general Adam Marshall said.
Last week Prime Minister Theresa May told her Conservative Party to back her plan to leave the European Union as Britain entered ""the toughest part of the negotiations"".
Diplomatic sources told Reuters on Friday the EU's Brexit negotiators see a divorce deal as ""very close"".
Britain's economy has lagged behind the growth rate of many other rich countries for much of the period since the 2016 Brexit vote.
The BCC's quarterly survey showed that the percentage of services businesses looking to recruit more staff over the next three months fell to 47 percent from 60 percent, the lowest since the first quarter of 1993. Seventy-two percent of firms reported recruitment difficulties, the highest on record.
For manufacturers, growth in both export sales and new export orders was the slowest since the end of 2016.
""Weaker sterling is no longer providing a boon to many of our exporters, while consumer spending is failing to boost the domestic market,"" Marshall said.
Separately on Monday, accountancy firm Deloitte said its survey of chief financial officers pointed to slower business spending and hiring after Brexit.
Only 13 percent of CFOs were more optimistic about the prospects for their company than they were three months ago, down from 24 percent in July, Deloitte said.
Seventy-nine percent said they expected the long-term business environment to be worse as a result of leaving the EU, the highest share since the 2016 Brexit vote.
David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte North West Europe, said confidence could recover if Britain secured a Brexit deal.
""A deal with a sensible transition period would remove the uncertainty and should deliver a real boost to business spirits,"" he said.
Economists polled by Reuters expect official data due on Wednesday to show solid economic growth of 0.6 percent for the three months to August, though the year-on-year performance is predicted to be less impressive at 1.5 percent.
Much of the growth in the economy this year has been driven by stronger-than-expected spending by consumers, despite a continued squeeze on their spending power by inflation running higher than wage growth.

Last month the BCC predicted growth for 2018 would slow to 1.1 percent, its weakest since the end of the 2008-09 recession.

939,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 12:23PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth cools; unemployment rate drops to 3.7 percent,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed sharply in September likely as Hurricane Florence depressed restaurant and retail payrolls, but the unemployment rate fell to near a 49-year low of 3.7 percent, pointing to a further tightening in labor market conditions.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday also showed a steady rise in wages, suggesting moderate inflation pressures, which could ease concerns about the economy overheating and keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate increases. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 134,000 jobs last month, the fewest in a year, as the retail and leisure and hospitality sectors shed employment. Data for July and August were revised to show 87,000 more jobs added than previously reported.
The economy needs to create roughly 120,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
""The weaker gain in payrolls in September may partly reflect some hit from Hurricane Florence,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""There is little in this report to stop the Fed continuing to raise interest rates gradually.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 185,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the economy's outlook was ""remarkably positive"" and he believed it was on the cusp of a ""historically rare"" era of ultra-low unemployment and tame inflation. 
The U.S. central bank raised rates last week for the third time this year and removed the reference in its post-meeting statement to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative.""
The Labor Department said it was possible that Hurricane Florence, which lashed South and North Carolina in mid-September, could have affected employment in some industries. It said it was impossible to quantify the net effect on employment.
Payrolls are calculated from a survey of employers, which treats any worker who was not paid for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th of the month as unemployed. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours in September.
The smaller survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived regards persons as employed regardless of whether they missed work during the reference week and were unpaid as result. It showed 299,000 people reported staying at home last month because of bad weather, compared to an average of 85,000 for a normal September.
The weakness in payrolls last month is not corroborated by other labor market data. An Institute for Supply Management survey published this week showed robust employment gains in the services sector in September. 
Economists also noted that the initial September payrolls growth estimate tended to be revised higher.
U.S. Treasury prices fell, with the yield on the 30-year bond rising to a four-year high. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
DIMINISHING SLACK 
The drop of two-tenths of a percentage point in the unemployment rate from 3.9 percent in August pushed it to levels last seen in December 1969 and matched the Fed's forecast of 3.7 percent by the end of this year.
Average hourly earnings increased 0.3 percent in September after a similar rise in August. With September's increase below the 0.5 percent gain notched during the same period last year, the annual rise in wages fell to 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent in August, which was the biggest advance in more than nine years.
Wage growth remains sufficient to keep inflation around the Fed's 2 percent target. 
Some economists say wage growth might be understated amid anecdotal evidence that worker shortages as a result of the tightening labor market were forcing companies to raise compensation. Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) announced this week that it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees starting in November.
""Businesses of all sizes are indicating they are doing whatever they can to keep their workers,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The standard measures just don't reflect those increases well, if at all.""
Last month, employment in the leisure and hospitality sector fell by 17,000 jobs, the first drop since September 2017, with payrolls at bars and restaurants tumbling by 18,200. Retail payrolls dropped by 20,000 jobs in September amid widespread declines across the sector. 
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 18,000 in September after rising by 5,000 in August. Construction companies hired 23,000 more workers last month after increasing payrolls by 26,000 jobs in August.
Professional and business services employment increased by 54,000 jobs last month and government payrolls rose 13,000.
While surveys have shown manufacturers growing more concerned about an escalating trade war between the United States and China, it does not appear to have affected hiring. In fact, the Fed's latest survey of national business conditions reflected concerns about labor shortages that are extending into non-skilled occupations as much as about tariffs.
Washington last month slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods. The trilateral trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico was salvaged in an 11th-hour deal on Sunday.
Despite the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, the trade deficit continues to deteriorate. The trade gap surged 6.4 percent to a six-month high of $53.2 billion in August, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. 
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China increased 4.7 percent to a record high of $38.6 billion.

""Growth in imports likely will remain solid in coming quarters as long as growth in domestic demand remains buoyant,"" said Jay Bryson, global economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap increased 6.4 percent to $53.2 billion, widening for a third straight month. Data for July was revised to show the trade deficit rising to $50.0 billion, instead of the previously reported $50.1 billion.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China surged 4.7 percent to a record high of $38.6 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall trade deficit swelling to $53.5 billion in August. 
The trade gap continues to widen despite the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies, which have led to a bitter trade war between the United States and China.
Washington has also engaged in tit-for-tat import duties with the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States has since struck a trade deal with Canada and Mexico.
The Trump administration says eliminating the trade deficit will put the economy on a sustainable path of faster growth, an argument that has been dismissed by many economists as flawed given constraints such as low productivity and slow population growth.
When adjusted for inflation, the trade gap widened to $86.3 billion in August, the highest since January 2006, from $82.4 billion in July. The jump in the so-called real trade deficit suggests that trade could subtract as much as one percentage point from gross domestic product in the third quarter.
Trade contributed 1.2 percentage points to the economy's 4.2 percent annualized growth pace in the second quarter, mostly reflecting a front-loading of soybean exports to China before Beijing's retaliatory tariffs came into effect in early July.

Exports of goods and services fell 0.8 percent to $209.4 billion in August. Soybean exports dropped $1.0 billion and shipments of crude oil fell $0.9 billion. 
Imports of goods and services increased 0.6 percent to a record $262.7 billion in August. They were boosted by imports of motor vehicles, which were the highest on record, and cellphones. There were also increases in petroleum imports.

Payrolls Climb Less Than Expected; Jobless Rate Hits 48-Year Low,"Investing.com - The U.S. created fewer jobs than expected in September, the Labor Department reported Friday, but job gains for the previous two months were revised higher and the unemploymet rate reached a 48-year low.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 134,000 last month. Economists were expecting a gain of 185,000 jobs.
Payroll gains for August were revised to 270,000 from the 201,000 initially reported, while July was revised up to 165,000 from 147,000.
The unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, a level not seen since 1969.
Average hourly earnings, an important number to gauge inflation, rose 2.8% year over year in September. Month on month, wages grew 0.3%. Both measures were in line with expectations.
Investors remained hesitant over what the numbers meant for stocks. The glass-half-full interpretation would focus on the lower-than-expected payroll rise as putting less pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise rates, especially with wage growth arriving as anticipated. But the glass-half-empty view would note the strong upward revisions, and the impact on Hurricane Florence on September's hiring, which indicate the labor market is still on a tear.
S&P 500 Futures remained barely in negative territory after the report was released, littlle changed from where they were ahead of the numbers.
Bond yields, which pummeled stocks on Thursday, continued to climb, though. The yield on the 10-Year Treasury hit a new 7-year high of 3.227% shortly after the data arrived, up from 3.202% just before, but then pared gains.
While it's great to see the labor market recovery continue into its eigth year, the Fed has to be worried about job growth continuing at this pace, University of Michigan Economics Professor Justin Wolfers tweeted.



Professional and business services led the September jobs gains, rising by 54,000 last month. Health care and construction employment gains were also strong.
The labor force participation rate stayed at 62.7%.
The broader U6 measure of unemployment rose to 7.5% in September from 7.4% in August, as the number of people working part-time for economic reasons increased by 263,000. The number of long-term unemployed workers remained at 1.4 million."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India held interest rates unchanged at a policy meeting on Friday, sending the rupee tumbling to a record low and stunning analysts who had expected a rate increase to combat inflationary pressures arising from high oil prices.
The RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) left the repo rate  at 6.50 percent, though 35 out of 64 analysts surveyed by Reuters last week had forecast a rate hike. The MPC also held the reverse repo rate  at 6.25 percent.
The panel however, shifted its policy stance to 'calibrated tightening"" from 'neutral'. Five of the six panel members voted to leave the rate unchanged.
""Today's stance of calibrated tightening essentially means that in this rate cycle a rate cut is off the table, and that we are not bound to increase rates at every meeting,"" said RBI Governor Urjit Patel at a press conference. ""As new data comes in we would look into changing our policies accordingly.""
While the RBI kept its rates unchanged, analysts expect the central bank to raise rates by at least 50 basis points more going ahead, as inflationary pressures become more pronounced.
""The RBI policy announcement of keeping rates unchanged is a surprise,"" said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research, at brokerage firm IIFL Securities Ltd, adding that if crude prices continue to surge then RBI may have to may have to frontload rate hikes.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield  fell to 8.08 percent from 8.13 percent before the policy was announced, as traders expected a rate hike were caught wrong-footed.
The Indian rupee  slumped to a new all-time low of 74.23 against the U.S. dollar, weakening from around the 73.65 ahead of the RBI policy statement. 
It has fallen more than 14 percent since January, making it the worst performing major Asian emerging market currency.
The decline steepened in recent weeks as rising crude price - India imports two-thirds of its oil needs - and a sell-off by investors in emerging markets cranked up the pressure on the country's external balances. During April-June India's balance of payments slipped into deficit for the first time in six quarters.
Other Asian central banks in nations running trade deficits and exposed to portfolio outflows and higher oil prices have shown more urgency in hiking interest rates. 
Last week, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) hiked rates by 50 bps to 4.50 percent, adding to the three hikes worth 100 bps since May. Bank Indonesia added 25 bps to its four previous hikes this year, bringing rates to 5.75 percent as expected, or 150 bps higher since May. 
In its policy statement on Friday, the RBI said headwinds in the form of escalating trade tensions, volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening financial conditions globally posed substantial risks to the growth and inflation outlook.
Hence, the RBI said that it was vital ""to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.""
With a general election due by May next year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party will want to campaign on strong economic growth and success in containing inflation.
Taking a more gradual approach to raising rates should make it easier to sustain economic growth, with the RBI forecasting expansion of 7.4 percent for the financial year ending in March and 7.6 percent for the following year.

The RBI reiterated its target of keeping consumer inflation at 4.00 percent in the medium term on a ""durable basis"", and projected a rate of 4.8 percent by June 2019, slightly better than the 5.0 percent forecast it gave in August.

Wifo, which compiles gross domestic product (GDP) data for the government, forecast 3.0 percent GDP growth for this year, down from a 3.2 percent estimate it gave three months ago.
It now expects growth to slow to 2.0 percent next year, down from its previous forecast for 2.2 percent, as emerging market currency crises, U.S. trade policy and questions over Brexit overshadow global trade, weighing on Austrian export growth and companies' willingness to invest.
""Private household spending will continue to support the economy but will not fully compensate for the decline in export demand,"" it said.
The other think-tank, IHS, which generally takes a more conservative approach, trimmed its GDP growth forecast to 2.7 percent, three months after it had raised it to 2.9 percent from 2.8 percent.
IHS still expects Austrian economic growth to slow sharply to 1.7 percent in 2019.

Contracts for German goods rose by 2.0 percent after a fall of 0.9 percent in the previous month, the ministry said on Friday. A Reuters poll of analysts had predicted a rise of 0.5 percent in August.
""The strong increase in orders from non-European countries proves that German industrial products remain in demand worldwide, regardless of trade conflicts,"" the ministry said in a statement.
It said the rise was helped by a clearing bottleneck in the auto sector that had stemmed from the introduction of a new pollution standard - the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) - for which some German car models needed to gain regulatory clearance.
With that hurdle overcome, ""the positive economic trend in the industrial sector should resume in the fourth quarter,"" the ministry said.
Friday's stronger-than-expected data followed a solid business confidence reading from Europe's largest economy last week.
The Ifo economic institute's survey showed business morale held steady in Germany in September, propped up by consumer spending and construction, pointing to further growth even if a uncertain global economic outlook worsened.
""We don't need to worry about the German economy, even if in 2018 it looks like there will be a slower rate of growth than originally expected,"" said Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP bank.
The government has forecast 2.3 percent growth this year and 2.1 percent for 2019.

Inflation accelerated to 6.7 percent from 6.4 percent in August, the Philippine Statistics Authority said in Manila on Friday. That compared with the 6.8 percent median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Consumer prices started spiking at the beginning of the year following tax increases on fuel, sugary drinks and cigarettes -- the increases swiftly moved to rice, the nation’s staple food, due to supply shortages. On top of that, a more than 8 percent slump in the currency this year is adding to the inflationary pressure.
“Pressure is still rising and the central bank may raise rates by another 25 basis points this quarter,” said Eugenia Fabon Victorino, head of Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB in Singapore. “We know that inflation will breach the 2018 target, but what’s important is whether or not the breach will extend to next year.”
The central bank has delivered 150 basis points of interest-rate increases since May, and forecasts annual inflation will exceed a target of 2 percent to 4 percent until next year.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation's (REC) gauge of permanent job starting salaries rose to 64.5 from 62.4 in August to hit its highest level since April 2015.
While that may give the Bank of England confidence that overall wage growth in Britain will continue to pick up as it has forecast, REC's index of staff demand fell in September to its weakest level since late 2016.
This measure has led starting salaries by a couple of months on average over the survey's 21-year history.
The latest official data on earnings showed British workers' pay, excluding bonuses, accelerated in the three months to July to a rate that has not been surpassed in three years as firms found it harder to hire staff.
Recruiters cited Brexit as the biggest reason for uncertainty in the supply of labor, REC said on Friday, pointing to a drop in the availability of candidates -- particularly in areas such as medicine.
This week Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain's post-Brexit immigration system will prioritize high-skilled workers and treat European Union citizens the same as those from elsewhere.
Business groups have expressed concern that companies will be left without easy access to the workers they need.
""An effective approach to post-Brexit immigration must acknowledge that there is unmet need for roles of all sorts - not just those filled by the very highest earners,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.

""Keeping deliveries going, patients being treated and goods on the shelves means an open approach to workers from elsewhere.""

The 0.6 percent decline in real wages in August from a year earlier followed a revised 0.5 percent annual increase in July, labor ministry data showed on Friday.
Summer bonuses boosted real wages in June, but since then real wages have been losing momentum as consumer prices have crept higher due to rising gasoline and kerosene costs.
The decline in real wages suggests consumers may start cutting back on other spending so they can more easily pay to fuel their cars and heat their homes.
Nominal cash earnings rose 0.9 percent year-on-year in August, slower than a revised 1.6 percent annual increase in July.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, grew 1.3 percent in August from a year earlier. Special one-off payments, which include summer bonuses, fell an annual 7.4 percent in August after a revised 2.8 percent annual increase in the previous month.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, rose 1.0 percent year-on-year versus an annual 1.6 percent increase in July.
Major Japanese firms typically pay bonuses twice a year, once during the summer and once near year's end.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending unexpectedly jumped in August from a year earlier to mark a second month of gains, suggesting a tight job market and steady economic expansion are boosting households' purchasing power.
While many analysts expect a moderate expansion to continue, some warn that economic growth may slow or even contract in the July-September quarter due to a string of natural disasters.
Escalating global trade frictions also cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy, which saw business confidence worsen in the three months to September.
Household spending rose 2.8 percent in August from a year earlier, confounding market expectations for a 0.1 percent fall and following a 0.1 percent gain in July, government data showed on Friday.
A tightening job market has gradually increased household income and helped underpin household spending, which makes up roughly 50 percent of Japan's economic activity.
But consumption has failed to gain enough momentum to prod companies into raising prices, keeping inflation distant from the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target.
Some analysts warn that flooding rains, typhoons and an earthquake that hit Japan in the third quarter could weigh on growth by disrupting supply chains and keeping households from shopping.
The government plans to compile an extra budget for disaster relief, though any spending likely would not be big enough to have a sizable impact on the economy.

Solid growth in consumption is considered crucial for premier Shinzo Abe, who reshuffled his cabinet after winning a ruling party leadership race last month, to proceed with a scheduled increase in the sales tax next October.

Borrowing costs on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held home loan type in the United States, averaged 4.71 percent in the week ended Oct. 4, which was a tad lower than 4.72 percent the week before, the mortgage finance agency said.
Freddie Mac's latest measures on home borrowing costs did not reflect the bond market selloff on Wednesday when benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) hit a seven-year peak, a company spokesman said.
Treasury yields, which influence mortgage rates, have increased since Wednesday on upbeat economic data and perceived hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials.
In early Thursday trading, the 10-year yield touched 3.232 percent. 
Rising mortgage rates will likely become another headwind for the housing sector that is already struggling with tight inventory and rising building costs.

""With mortgage rates expected to track higher, it’s going to be a challenge for the housing market to regain momentum,” Freddie Mac's chief economist Sam Khater said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 49-year low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength, which should continue to underpin economic growth.
The labor market, which is viewed as being near or at full employment, is steadily boosting wage growth, which could help to support consumer spending as the stimulus from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades.
""The momentum in the labor market remains strong and we expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 207,000 for the week ended Sept. 29, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That reversed the bulk of the increase from the prior week when claims were boosted by Hurricane Florence, which slammed North and South Carolina in mid-September.
Applications fell to 202,000 during the week ended Sept. 15, which was the lowest level since November 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 213,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for North and South Carolina continued to be affected by the storm.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 500 to 207,000 last week.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the report.
The claims data has no bearing on September's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 185,000 in September after surging 201,000 in August. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent, an 18-year low first hit in May.
Payrolls growth could, however, surprise on the upside as data on Wednesday showed an increase in hiring by private companies in September and a jump in private sector jobs. 
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week for the third time this year and removed the reference to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative.""
FACTORY ORDERS REBOUND
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said new orders for U.S.-made goods recorded their biggest increase in nearly a year in August, but signs of weakness in business spending on equipment suggested manufacturing could be slowing.
Factory goods orders surged 2.3 percent, the largest increase since September 2017, boosted by a surge in demand for aircraft, after falling 0.5 percent in July. Orders increased 8.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in August.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is being supported by robust domestic demand, but momentum is expected to gradually slow amid worker shortages, an increasingly bitter trade war between the United States and China, a strong dollar and moderating global growth.
An Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturers published on Tuesday showed factory activity retreated from a 14-year high in September.
In August, orders for transportation equipment vaulted 13.1 percent, the largest gain since June 2017. That reflected a 69.1 percent surge in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft and parts. Orders for defense aircraft and parts soared 17.0 percent in August. Transportation orders fell 3.6 percent in July.
Orders for motor vehicles rose 1.0 percent in August after increasing 1.6 percent in July. There were increases in orders for primary metals, fabricated metal products and electronic equipment, appliances and components. But orders for machinery and computers and electronic products fell.
The Commerce Department also said August orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, fell 0.9 percent instead of declining 0.5 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 1.5 percent in July.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, dropped 0.2 percent in August instead of rising 0.1 percent as reported last month.

Core capital goods shipments increased 1.2 percent in July. Business spending on equipment slowed in the second quarter after growing robustly since the first quarter of 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity raced to a 21-year high in September and companies boosted hiring, signs of enduring strength in the economy at the end of the third quarter.
The upbeat reports on Wednesday likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again in December. The U.S. central bank increased rates last week for the third time this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the economy's outlook was ""remarkably positive.""
""The continued strength of the surveys implies that growth is set to remain well above trend,"" said Andrew Hunter, a U.S. Economist at Capital Economics in London. ""That will keep the Fed raising interest rates steadily in the near term.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index jumped 3.1 points to 61.6 last month, the highest reading since August 1997. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The ISM's new orders sub-index for the services sector increased 1.2 points to a reading of 61.6 last month. The survey's factory employment measure jumped to 62.4 in September from 56.7 in August. This suggests September's nonfarm payrolls could surprise on the upside when the government publishes its closely watched employment report on Friday.
ISM survey, however, probably exaggerates the economy's strength as another survey from data firm IHS Markit showed services sector activity expanding at a weaker pace in September.
Companies in the ISM survey were upbeat about business conditions last month, but reported lingering concerns ""about capacity, logistics and the uncertainty with global trade."" 
Industries are bumping against capacity constraints in a robust economy and tightening labor market conditions.
Companies are increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers to meet demand, leading to delays in delivering goods and services 
At the same time, the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies, which have left the United States embroiled in a bitter trade war with China and tit-for-tat tariffs with other trade partners, have raised the cost of some raw materials.
Washington last month slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods.
IMPORT TARIFFS UNCERTAINTY
According to the ISM, while retailers were bullish about business they said there was ""a lot of uncertainty"" about the import duties and that this ""may cause a shift in production sites."" Wholesalers said the import tariffs were ""inflating prices, which are difficult to pass along to the end user due to competitive pressures.""
There were also complaints about labor shortages, especially truck drivers. The ISM's supplier deliveries index for the services sector increased last month, pointing to bottlenecks in the supply chain. 
Companies reported that ""suppliers are getting backlogged"" and that there were also ""capacity and material shortages."" They also reported paying higher prices for materials and services.
""For the time being, firms appear to be looking through heightened risks from tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, belying widespread comments of their concern,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
""We continue to see evidence of inflationary pressures moving through supply chains."" 
The dollar firmed marginally against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) at an all-time high.
Separately on Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls jumped by 230,000 jobs in September, the largest gain since February, after increasing 168,000 in August.
Last month's rise beat economists' expectations for a 185,000 increase. The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the more comprehensive employment report for September due on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 185,000 in September after surging 201,000 in August. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent, an 18-year low first hit in May. 
While the ADP report has a poor record predicting the private-payrolls component of the government's employment report, last month's jump underscored robust labor market conditions that should underpin consumer spending.
""The labor market continues to boil and is growing hotter,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""More workers with money in hand to spend will lead to more consumer spending down the road.""

The ADP report showed construction payrolls rose by 34,000 jobs last month, accelerating from 3,000 in August. The services sector added 184,000 jobs in September, led by the professional and health services. Services sector employment increased by 145,000 jobs in August.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on requests for a loan to buy a home and to refinance an existing home was flat at 352.6 in the week ended Sept. 28.
Rising mortgage rates may be another headwind for the housing market which is already struggling with tight inventory and rising building costs, analysts said.
Interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages, whose balances are $453,100 or less, on average dipped to 4.96 percent from last week's 4.97 percent, which was the highest since April 2011.
Average borrowing costs on 30-year jumbo loans, whose balances are greater than $453,100, were 4.93 percent, which was the highest since July 2011. Last week, they were 4.92 percent.
Interest rates on 30-year mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, which are typically used by first-time home buyers or consumers with patch credits, averaged 4.95 percent, which was the highest since May 2011. Last week, they averaged 4.94 percent, MBA said.
Average 15-year mortgage rates edged up to 4.39 percent, which was the highest since April 2010, from 4.38 percent the prior week.
The slim pickup in borrowing costs did not have much impact on mortgage application activity.
MBA's seasonally-adjusted gauge on home purchase requests rose 0.1 percent 240.7 last week, the highest level in over three months.

The group's seasonally-adjusted measure on refinancing applications dipped 0.1 percent to 945.9, which was not far above the lowest level since Dec. 2000 set three weeks earlier.

DETROIT (Reuters) - North American orders for Class 8 semi-trucks jumped 92 percent in September as trucking companies continued to struggle with tight capacity in a booming U.S. freight market, FTR, a company that tracks the industry, said on Wednesday.
September was the 10th best month ever for North American sales of big rigs and capped the highest-ever quarter for sales. 
Preliminary orders for the big 18-wheelers that haul freight along the highways of the United States, Canada and Mexico reached 42,300 trucks, up 92 percent from 22,082 in September 2017. 
The tight U.S. freight market means many rail and truck customers are grappling with how to defend profit margins as transportation costs continue to climb.
""The economy is surging right now, putting stress on shippers to find trucks to deliver goods on time,"" Don Ake, FTR's vice president of commercial vehicles, said in a statement. ""Fleets don't want to be stuck in the same situation next year, so they are placing huge orders for trucks well ahead of time.""
""Demand, as indicated by the surge in orders, will be even stronger next year,"" he added. 
Full-year 2017 orders for Class 8 trucks came in at 290,000 units, compared with 164,000 in 2016. The United States is by far the largest market in North America.
Over the last 12 months, orders for semi-trucks have totaled 497,000 units.

The main truck makers in the U.S. market are  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV),  Paccar Inc  (O:PCAR) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish inflation surged to nearly 25 percent in September from a year earlier, official data showed on Wednesday, hitting its highest in 15 years and sharpening focus on whether the central bank will be able to deliver another hefty rate hike.
The size of the increase - prices jumped by 6.3 percent from a month earlier - far outpaced expectations and underscored the deep impact of a currency crisis on the economy and consumers. 
The lira has lost nearly 40 percent of its value this year against the dollar, hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over the central bank and a rift with Washington. 
That sell-off has pushed up prices of everything from food to fuel and eroded confidence in what was once a high-flying emerging market. 
""The central bank will need to react to this,"" said Inan Demir, senior emerging markets economist at Nomura. ""This is not something that could be ignored and they will have to hike at their next meeting.""
The lira weakened slightly after the release of the data and was at 6.0500 to the U.S. dollar, about 1 percent weaker on the day, at 0748 GMT. It has been underpinned in recent weeks by the central bank's massive September rate hike and hopes for an improvement in ties with the United States, particularly over the fate of a jailed American pastor. 
Inflation rose to 24.52 percent in September from a year earlier, the data from the Turkish Statistical Institute showed. In August the year-on-year figure was 17.9 percent.
The month-on-month jump of 6.3 percent outstripped the 3.6 percent forecast in a Reuters poll of 15 economists. 
The central bank last month raised interest rates by 6.25 percentage points to put a floor under a lira and try to rein in inflation. Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", has repeatedly called for lower rates to keep cheaper credit flowing, particularly to the construction industry.
Following the last rate hike, Erdogan said his patience with interest rates had limits. Such comments have undermined confidence in the central bank's independence and triggered the currency sell-off in the first place.
NOT UNANIMOUS
Not all economists agreed the central bank would increase rates at its next meeting this month.
""Given the scale of last month's rate hike and continued pressure from President Erdogan for rates not to be raised further, we think that policy will be left on hold,"" said Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics in a note, adding inflation likely had a ""bit further"" to rise in the coming months.
Food and non-alcoholic drinks prices, key to consumer price inflation, surged 6.4 percent month-on-month. Furnishing and household equipment posted the highest monthly increase at 11.41 percent, followed by transportation at 9.15 percent, the data showed.
Producer prices rose 10.88 percent month-on-month in September for an annual rise of 46.15 percent, the data showed.
Financial markets have long been concerned about Erdogan's control over monetary policy, which they say has undermined the central bank's ability to fight inflation.
In a decade and a half in power, Erdogan and his government have built bridges, power plants and hospitals and improved the lives of millions of lower-income, pious Turks. 
But economists say the boom years focused more on consumption rather than productivity - that Turkey built shopping malls when it should have been investing more in factories and education.
The lira sell-off has put focus on problems in the real economy and the potential for a crisis at Turkey's banks. 
For years Turkish companies have loaded up on cheap euro and dollar loans. But the lira crisis has driven up the cost of servicing that debt, meaning lenders face a wave of defaults.
U.S. PASTOR
""The currency has appreciated and the central bank has hiked rates aggressively, so going forwards, towards the end of the year, inflation numbers should stabilize,"" said Bernd Berg, a global macro and foreign exchange strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Zurich.
""To me the worst of currency crisis is over and we should see some stabilization.""
Analysts have said that the next important event for the lira will be the trial of the U.S. evangelical Christian Pastor Andrew Brunson.
Brunson is charged with links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric blamed by Turkey for a failed coup attempt in 2016. He has denied the accusation, as has Gulen, and Washington has demanded his immediate release.
The diplomatic rift - and U.S. President Donald Trump's doubling of steel tariffs in response to Brunson's detention - has added to the pain for the lira. 
Brunson's lawyer said he filed an appeal for his client's release from house arrest on Wednesday.

The pastor is next due in court on Oct. 12.

960,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Turkish Inflation Near Highest in Erdogan Era as Lira Slides,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s consumer inflation climbed near the highest levels since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power 15 years ago, spurring calls for higher interest rates to rein in prices.
The inflation rate rose for a sixth month to 24.5 percent in September from a year earlier, above all expectations in a Bloomberg survey where the median estimate was 21.1 percent. The monthly rate was 6.3 percent, driven by an across-the-board surge provoked by the lira’s meltdown.
Wednesday’s inflation report puts monetary policy makers in a bind. The central bank raised borrowing costs last month to their highest level in nearly two decades, yet prices are gaining at their fastest pace since June 2003.
Given his distaste for higher interest rates and an apparent slowdown in the economy, the bank has little room to act against further price surges. But with the lira losing as much as 40 percent of its value against the dollar since the beginning of the year, the worst may be yet to come.
“An inflation print so bad that it truly feels like old Turkey,” said Inan Demir, an economist at Nomura International in London. “But this is simply too bad to ignore. Note that annual headline inflation is now above the bank’s policy rate at 24 percent, which calls for another rate hike.”
The lira weakened as much as 1.6 percent after the data release and was trading 1.2 percent lower at 6.0579 to the dollar at 10:21 a.m. in Istanbul.

Research firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.9 in September compared to forecasts for a reading of 54.0. The prior month’s reading was 54.3.
“The service sector continued to report solid steady business growth in September which, alongside news of sustained expansions in both manufacturing and construction, suggests the UK economy expanded by just under 0.4% in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
The report indicated that higher levels of business activity were attributed to a solid increase in new work and competitive pricing strategies during September.
But the report also noted that Brexit concerns and heightened economic uncertainty remained the main constraints on growth.
Higher wage bills and rising fuel prices resulted in a sharp cost increases last month, but prices charged by service providers increased at only a moderate pace, with the latest rise the slowest for just over a year.
“The steady economic expansion and intensification of cost pressures will add to views that the next move in interest rates will be another hike. However, with Brexit uncertainty intensifying in recent weeks, any rise seems unlikely prior to the scheduled March 29th exit from the EU,” Williamson concluded."

IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 55.0 from 55.6 in August.
The reading came in slightly below a preliminary estimate published last month but was still well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
In the services sector, business activity increased to 55.9 in September, up from 55.0 the previous month, with the rate of job creation hitting its highest in nearly 11 years and service firms remaining very optimistic about future business.
""For the first time in almost two years, the service sector grew at a faster rate than manufacturing, confirming a fundamental shift in the growth drivers of the euro area's largest economy,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
German services are benefiting from strong domestic demand thanks to record-high employment, rising real wages, increased job security and low borrowing costs.

August retail sales rose 9.5 percent from a year earlier in value terms to HK$38.2 billion ($4.87 billion), marking their eighteenth month of expansion. That compares with a 7.8 percent rise in July. 
In volume terms, retail sales grew 8.1 percent in August, compared with a 5.9 percent rise in July.
A government spokesman said favorable job and income conditions, as well as sustained growth in inbound tourism should support the retail sector in the near term.
For the first eight months of 2018, total retail sales rose 12.2 percent in value terms and 10.6 percent in volume terms.
Analysts said escalating Sino-U.S. trade tension was hurting sentiment, while a weaker yuan also made the Hong Kong dollar more expensive.
Growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September as external and domestic demand weakened.
Economists expect China's growth to cool further in coming months, with a barrage of August economic data doing little to dispel views that domestic demand is softening.
The country's retail sales rose a better-than-expected 9 percent in August, driven by jewelry and home appliances. 
Meanwhile, analysts are optimistic that tourist arrivals to Hong Kong from mainland China will remain strong over the long term.
""We expect better connectivity between HK and the mainland after the commencement of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-HK high-speed railway and HK-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge ... to drive up mainland tourist numbers and see it as a positive for the whole HK retail market,"" Nomura said in a research note.
August tourist arrivals rose 17.4 percent from a year earlier to 5.896 million, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. The count of mainland visitors rose 22 percent, accounting for 81.8 percent of the total. 
For the first eight months, total tourist arrivals rose 10.4 percent, while mainland visitor numbers climbed 13.8 percent.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank marked a 26th straight month of stable policy on Tuesday, reinforcing market bets that rates will remain low for an extended period amid tighter credit conditions and lukewarm inflation and wages growth. 
In a widely expected move, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its October board meeting with rates held at an all-time low of 1.50 percent. 
Governor Philip Lowe acknowledged credit conditions were tighter but added that mortgage rates still remained low and there was ""strong competition"" for borrowers of high credit quality. 
""Growth in credit extended to owner-occupiers remains robust, but demand by investors has slowed noticeably as the dynamics of the housing market have changed,"" Lowe said.
""Credit conditions are tighter than they have been for some time.""
Home prices in Australia's once-booming property market have slipped in every single month since late last year though Lowe hasn't displayed any unease over this trend so far. 
Regulatory restrictions on lending to property investors together with greater scrutiny on banks' lending behavior have put a brake on skyrocketing prices. 
Australian banks are under the microscope for dodgy practices with an interim report from a powerful quasi-judicial Royal Commission inquiry out last week trashing the reputations of some of the country's biggest companies.
While the RBA made no mention of the Royal Commission or the interim report in Tuesday's short policy statement, the central bank is set to release it's biannual Financial Stability Review on Friday. 
The Australian dollar  barely budged after the policy decision, and was last fetching $0.7233.
""We think that the full effects of tighter credit conditions and falling house prices have yet to be felt. That means the labor market will tighten only slowly and inflation won’t rise much,"" said Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics. 
""Our view is that the Bank won’t raise interest rates until the second half of 2020.""
Indeed, the most distant futures contract is for March 2020 <0#YIB:> and that has only 20 basis points of tightening priced in.
Lowe remained upbeat about the A$1.8 trillion economy and has repeatedly said in recent comments that the next move in rates is likely to be up rather than down.
Stubbornly low inflation has been a major headache for policy makers, undershooting the RBA's 2-3 percent target band for more than 2 years now while wage growth is crawling near record lows at 2.1 percent.
""The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy,"" Lowe said.

""Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies' expectations for inflation over the next year receded slightly, a Bank of Japan survey showed on Tuesday, after the central bank conceded it will take some time to reach its inflation target.
Companies surveyed by the Bank of Japan expect consumer prices to have risen 0.8 percent a year from now, slightly below their projection of a 0.9 percent increase three months ago.
Firms expect consumer prices to have risen by an annual 1.1 percent three years from now and 1.1 percent five years ahead, unchanged from three months ago.
The BOJ kept policy steady at a meeting in September after taking steps in July to make its monetary framework more sustainable, such as allowing bond yields to move in a larger range around its zero percent target.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ made this decision in response to fears over the side-effects of its prolonged easing.
He has since acknowledged that inflation is taking longer loner than expected to accelerate. 
The BOJ's board has been divided between those who fret over the rising costs of prolonged easing such as low bond market liquidity, and those who insist the BOJ should do more to drive inflation towards its 2 percent target.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose a modest 0.9 percent in August from a year earlier, remaining distant from the central bank's objective.
The BOJ survey of corporate price expectations comes one day after the tankan showed rising raw material costs and a string of natural disasters that disrupted production sent business confidence at Japan's big manufacturers to its lowest in more than a year.

The BOJ's next policy meeting ends on October 31.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. factory activity retreated from a more than 14-year high in September as growth in new orders slowed, but supply bottlenecks appeared to be easing, suggesting a steady pace of expansion in manufacturing.
Other data on Monday showed a small increase in construction spending in August amid weakness in investment in private residential and nonresidential projects. The report did little to change views of strong economic growth in the third quarter.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped 1.5 points to a reading of 59.8 last month from 61.3 in August, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
""It may not be the best of times for manufacturers, but it is pretty close to that,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The ISM continued to describe demand as remaining ""robust."" The ISM also noted that ""the nation's employment resource and supply chains continued to struggle, but to a lesser degree."" It said factories remained ""overwhelmingly concerned about tariff-related activity, including how reciprocal tariffs will impact company revenue and current manufacturing locations.""
President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy have left the United States embroiled in a bitter trade war with China and tit-for-tat import tariffs with other trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
Washington last week slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods.
The United States salvaged a trilateral free trade accord with Canada and Mexico on Sunday, which underpins $1.2 trillion in trade between the three countries.
While data have suggested little impact on the economy so far from the tariffs, analysts warn that the import duties could disrupt supply chains, undercut business investment and slow the economy's momentum.
According to the ISM survey, some managers in the computer and electronic products industry said ""the market is in a state of chaos with the latest round of tariffs."" Their counterparts in the chemical products sector complained that ""tariffs (are) starting to take a bite out of profitability.""
FACTORY EMPLOYMENT RISES
The ISM's new orders sub-index fell to a reading of 61.8 last month from 65.1 in August. The survey's factory employment measure rose to 58.8, the highest reading since February, from 58.5 in August. 
This suggests manufacturing payrolls probably rebounded in September after falling in August for the first time in 13 months. The government will publish September's employment report on Friday. 
The ISM's supplier deliveries index fell to a reading of 61.1 last month, pointing to some easing in bottlenecks in the supply chain, from 64.5 in August. It hit a 14-year high of 68.2 in June. The ISM's prices paid measure fell to a 10-month low in September.
U.S. stocks were trading higher as investors breathed a sigh of relief following the trade pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico. The dollar firmed marginally against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yield rose.
A second report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in August after rising 0.2 percent in July. 
Spending on public construction projects jumped 2.0 percent in August to the highest level since July 2009. That followed a 1.7 percent increase in July. Spending on federal government construction projects soared 5.9 percent to a 10-month high after increasing 2.3 percent in July. 
State and local government construction outlays accelerated 1.7 percent in August to the highest level since March 2009. That followed a 1.6 percent rise in July.
But spending on private construction projects fell 0.5 percent in August after decreasing 0.2 percent in July. Private construction outlays have now declined for three straight months. Investment in private residential projects fell 0.7 percent in August after gaining 0.2 percent in July.
Homebuilding has been constrained by rising material costs as well as persistent land and labor shortages. Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year and is expected to have declined further in the third quarter.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, slipped 0.2 percent in August after declining 0.8 percent in July.
""We expect that residential investment will again weigh on real GDP growth in the third quarter,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""However, the continued decline in nonresidential construction spending implies downside to nonresidential structures investment in third-quarter GDP.""

Growth estimates for the third quarter are above a 3.0 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 07:55AM ET</span>","Turkish manufacturing slides to 9-year low, economists see evidence of recession","By Ezgi Erkoyun and Orhan Coskun
ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish manufacturing activity slid to its lowest level in nine years in September, a business survey showed on Monday, in what economists said was among the clearest signs yet that Turkey was headed for a deep recession after months of currency turmoil.
Further underscoring the pain for consumers and businesses, authorities hiked electricity and natural gas prices for the third month running, sources said, as the lira's sell-off drives up the cost of everything from food to fuel.
The currency has lost some 37 percent of its value against the dollar so far this year, hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's control over monetary policy and a diplomatic rift with the United States. The crisis has reverberated across global markets and deepened concerns about the outlook for Turkey's banks and manufacturers.
A closely watched measure of manufacturing health, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), fell to its lowest since March 2009, the survey from Istanbul Chamber of Industry and IHS Markit showed. The decline was driven by a slowdown in output and new orders, the survey showed, which in turn caused scaling back in employment and purchasing activity.
""The sharp drop in Turkey's PMI last month chimes with other very weak survey data and adds to the evidence that the economy has entered a deep recession,"" Liam Carson of Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
Inflation hit 18 percent last month, its highest in nearly 15 years, and is expected to surge to 20 percent this year. Turkey is dependent on imports, which are usually denominated in foreign currency, for almost all of its energy needs.
Turkey's energy regulator raised electricity prices for residences by 9 percent and by 18.6 percent for industry from October 1, sources said, after the state-owned gas operator made a similar increase.
PAIN FOR SHOPPERS
Highlighting the pain for shoppers, retail prices in Istanbul surged by more than four percent in September from a month earlier, data showed. Retail prices in Turkey's biggest city were nearly 19 percent more expensive last month than they were in September 2017.
The government has responded to the crisis by cutting its growth forecasts for this year and next and promising to tighten spending. The central bank's mammoth 6.25 percentage point rate increase, and Erdogan's attempts to repair ties with the United States have gone some way to ease investor concerns, although worries remain, particularly about banks.
In one bright patch for the economy, data showed that exports rose 22.6 percent year-on-year in September, to $14.5 billion, the Trade Ministry said. The trade deficit shrank 76.85 percent, the ministry said.

The most exported products were cars, it said, with Germany, Britain and Italy the leading export destinations. Turkey imported the most from Russia, China and Germany, it said.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 06:15AM ET</span>","European, Asian factory growth sputters on weakening exports","By Rahul Karunakar and Leika Kihara
BENGALURU/TOKYO (Reuters) - Growth in factory activity slowed across Europe and Asia in September, with export orders weakening before the latest escalation in the U.S.-China trade conflict, in another sign the global economy is shifting into lower gear.
Business surveys released on Sunday and Monday showed the pace of expansion slowing across European and Asian factories. Gauges of future activity offered little hope for a turnaround in the next few months.
Some of the gloom will be offset by news that the United States and Canada clinched a deal on Sunday to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement, removing one near-term risk to the global outlook.
But with neither Beijing nor Washington ready to compromise and the latest tariffs on each other's goods already imposed, that conflict is a worrying backdrop to a weakening factory expansion in Europe and Asia.
Manufacturing growth in the euro zone slowed to a two-year low at the end of the third quarter, according to the latest IHS Markit purchasing managers' indices.
""Overall, the picture remains for a less buoyant manufacturing sector in Q3, with not very strong signs yet of a better outlook for the end of the year,"" noted Nicola Nobile, a senior economist at Oxford Economics.
""A slowdown in world trade and continuing concerns about the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on manufacturing sentiment.""
German manufacturing growth slowed to just over a two-year low in September, grew at the slowest pace in three months in France and stagnated in Italy, marking the first time in two years of no expansion.
Weaker export order growth was a common explanation for the slowdown across the euro zone.
And while British factories perked up unexpectedly in September, halting a three-month run of slowing growth, the bigger picture was subdued performance, just six months before the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union.
ASIA GROWTH FALTERING
Two manufacturing surveys from China on Sunday pointed to weakening in its vast manufacturing sector. A private poll showed factory growth stalled after 15 months of expansion, while an official gauge confirmed manufacturing was losing steam under the weight of shrinking export orders.
The first major readings on China for September suggest the world's second-largest economy is continuing to lose momentum as domestic demand weakens and U.S. tariffs bite. The combination is likely to prompt Beijing to roll out more growth-support measures in coming months.
However, analysts don't expect additional stimulus to start stabilizing China's economy until at least early next year.
Elsewhere in Asia, manufacturing also faltered in Vietnam, Taiwan and Indonesia last month, with Taiwan's factories expanding at the slowest pace in more than two years on sluggish export orders, business surveys showed on Monday.
Major economies like Japan and South Korea saw headline activity readings hold up, but also suffered declines in export orders, suggesting that increasing protectionism and concerns of slowing Chinese demand were weighing on Asia's biggest economies.
""Global growth is now cooling, which we think is weighing on foreign demand for Chinese goods irrespective of tariffs,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
India was among the few bright spots in Asia. Its factory activity expanded more quickly in September on strong domestic and export order growth, a welcome sign as policymakers worry about a sharp drop in the rupee and fallout from global trade frictions.
While rising protectionism is expected to deal the world economy a relatively modest blow this year, analysts expect risks will intensify in 2019 as tougher U.S. tariffs kick in and global borrowing costs rise.
""Countries that saw their currencies slump may be suffering from rising import costs. There are also signs China's slowdown and the trade friction are starting to hurt sentiment,"" said Koji Kobayashi, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.

""It would take time for companies to relocate production from China to other countries. That means the initial impact of the trade friction on Asian economies would be negative.""

970,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 11:17PM ET</span>","Natural disasters, trade woes sap Japan Inc's business confidence: tankan","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Rising raw material costs and a string of natural disasters that disrupted production sapped business confidence among Japan's big manufacturers in the September quarter, a central bank survey showed on Monday, taking it to the lowest in more than a year.
The survey gave little indication underlying sentiment had been hit by escalating global trade frictions. But the specter of a fully-fledged trade war weighed on companies' business outlook, which could threaten otherwise brisk capital expenditure, a bright spot in the world's third largest economy.
The survey casts doubt on the Bank of Japan's view that a solid economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to its elusive 2 percent target, although there were some signs that companies were gradually passing costs to their customers.
""Sentiment is leveling off due to slowing exports and weakening factory output amid worries of a global trade war,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Still, the level of sentiment is high. I don't think it will keep deteriorating either, given improving profits and rising prices.""
The headline index for big manufacturers' confidence fell to plus 19 in September from plus 21 three months ago, the BOJ's tankan survey showed, deteriorating for three straight quarters and lower than a median market forecast for plus 22.
The index for non-manufacturers fell to plus 22 from plus 24 in the June survey, matching a median market forecast and worsening for the first time in eight quarters.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to remain unchanged three months ahead, the survey showed.
Investors took the deterioration in the tankan business mood in their stride, pushing Japan's Nikkei share average (N225) to a 27-year high on Monday, as an extended weakening in yen helped improve export earnings prospects for Japanese corporations.
SOLID CAPEX
Despite the somewhat subdued business mood, the latest tankan underscored solid corporate capex plans, driven by demand for refurbishing capacity and boosting investment in robotics and automation to cope with labor shortages in the aging population.
Big companies plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4 percent in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019, compared with 13.6 percent in the previous tankan survey.
Capital expenditure plans at all firms grew 8.5 percent in this fiscal year, close to the pace seen during Japan's bubble economy era, Minami said.
""There's room for further improvement given that small companies firm up earnings estimates from now on, although that will depend much on how effects of a trade war play out in business sentiment,"" he said.
In an encouraging sign for Japan's battle with deflation, the survey showed companies became more able to pass on costs, with the index measuring change in output prices at plus 7 for big manufacturers, the highest in a decade.
Underscoring the tightening labor market, the survey's index measuring employment conditions at big firms hit minus 23, meaning the tightest level since 1992.
Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January to March thanks to robust business spending.

But a summer of escalating trade frictions and natural disasters that disrupted supply chains cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy.

971,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 10:18PM ET</span>",South Korea export outlook still seen solid despite sharp September drop,"By Hayoung Choi
SEOUL - South Korea's exports fell the most in over two years in September, but analysts chalked up the decline to fewer working days and said global demand for the country's goods still seems strong despite mounting Sino-U.S. trade tensions.
Indeed, South Korea's average exports per working day increased last month. And an earlier preliminary reading had pointed to solid double-digit export growth in the first few weeks of September before long holidays kicked in.
The rate of decline in the headline export reading was the sharpest since July 2016, and undershot a Reuters survey, where 11 economists forecast a 5.7 percent decrease from a year earlier.
By value, exports stood at $50.6 billion, way below August's $51.2 billion, preliminary data showed on Monday. By volume, they fell 16.2 percent.
Despite worries that the deepening dispute between Washington and Beijing will cause collateral damage for China's export-reliant neighbours, South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8 percent in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row.
On the other hand, exports to the United States dropped 11.8 percent as sales of petroleum goods declined. 
South Korea's overseas sales of memory chips and petroleum products increased 28.3 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively, despite concerns that a so-called ""super-cycle"" for memory chips has peaked. 
""The short-term concern (about export risks) is limited since chip sales to China are strong,"" said Chun Kyu-yeon, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment.
""Still, the impact from the trade conflict will be inevitable due to South Korean exports' considerable dependency on U.S. and Chinese markets.""
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $40.8 billion, also underperforming the survey that predicted 3.1 percent growth. That led to a preliminary trade surplus of $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August. 
The trade ministry said global manufacturing will remain upbeat thanks to the U.S. and EU countries, which will be a favourable factor for South Korean exports. 
""Higher export prices due to rising oil prices will also help the export in the second half of this year,"" the statement reads. 
""However, extension of trade conflict between Washington and Beijing and growing volatility following rate hike of the U.S. are downside pressure of exports.""
Average exports per working day rose to $2.6 billion, from $2.1 billion in August. 
There were only 19.5 working days in September this year because of the Chuseok holiday from Sept. 24 to 26, four fewer days than last year.
South Korean exports from January to September grew 4.7 percent in annual terms.

South Korea's factory activity rebounded in September, according to Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI), but the pick up was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan declined, which could overshadow the export outlook.

The index rose 0.9 percentage points to 50.2, just above the 50-point mark which divides expansion from contraction. In August, it had dropped below that line to 49.3.
The index for new export orders reached 50.6, the first time in three months it had not contracted, the government added.
It attributed the rise to ""tenacious adjustments"" by the manufacturing sector.
The government made no direct mention of China's increasingly bitter trade war with the United States, simply mentioning the need to be on alert to ""the influence of unstable factors in the external environment"".

Growth in China's manufacturing sector nationwide sputtered in September as both external and domestic demand weakened, two surveys showed on Sunday, raising pressure on policymakers as U.S. tariffs appear to be inflicting a heavier toll on the Chinese economy.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>","South Korea's factory activity rebounds, fastest growth in five-and-a-half years","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - South Korean factory activity expanded for the first time in seven months in September, as output recovered from a slump and new orders picked up pace even though export sales contracted for the second month, a private survey showed on Monday. 
The headline Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.3, and growing at the fastest clip in almost 5-1/2 years.
It was the first time since March that the index went above the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction.
The bounce was underpinned by output increasing at the fastest pace in 10 months at 51.7, recovering from 49.7 in August, supported by a pick up in new orders even though demand was largely domestically driven. 
""Amid a backdrop of intensifying trade tensions, South Korea's manufacturing sector showed a level of resilience during September’s survey period,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit. 
The job creation rate at 52.3 was also a welcome positive in the survey, growing at the strongest rate since May 2013, ""as firms continue to adjust to the various labor market reforms introduced at the beginning of the year,"" Hayes said.
The pick up in production levels, and greater R&D needs, helped boost payroll numbers, taking some of the sting off the deepening concerns over the country's worst jobless figures since the financial crisis.
Under the slogan of ""income-led growth,"" the South Korean government sharply hiked minimum wages and cut working hours from 68 to 52, a policy that has drawn sharp criticism from employers.
One sign of potential stress for the economy was the survey's measure of export sales, which contracted for the second month in a row, pressured by fewer orders from Japan and China amid a backdrop of escalating global trade tensions.
""Expectations of slower global growth weighed on business sentiment,"" said Hayes. 
Official data has shown brisk South Korean exports thanks to consistent demands from China, but policymakers worry the heated Sino-U.S. trade friction could drag on Asia's fourth largest economy. 
The survey also showed South Korean manufacturers facing input cost pressure in September, led by rising raw material costs and an unfavorable exchange rate.

The final Markit/Nikkei survey for Japan showed the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 52.5 in September, down from a flash reading of 52.9 but unchanged from the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 25th consecutive month, but a slump in expectations for future output to a 22-month low underscored worries about global trade tensions.
""The average PMI reading for Q3 was notably weaker than those for the first and second quarters of 2018, suggesting weaker momentum,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Although firms remained optimistic overall that output levels would be higher in a year's time, the degree of confidence dipped to a 22-month low, with some panelists raising concern toward the demand outlook.""
The sub-index measuring expectations for future output was revised up to 56.8 from a preliminary 55.9 but still showed sentiment was at its lowest since November 2016.
The index measuring export orders was revised down to 49.8 from a flash reading of 50.9 for the second consecutive month of contraction.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed last week to start trade talks in an arrangement that, for now, protects Japanese automakers from further tariffs, seen as a major threat to the export-dependent economy.
Still, there are lingering concerns that Japan will have to dramatically lower auto exports to the U.S. market and greatly increase the number of cars in makes in the United States to meet Trump's goal of creating more jobs and lowering the U.S. trade deficit.

Moreover, analysts worry an intensifying trade war between the United States and China - Japan's two biggest export markets - could drag on growth in the world's third biggest economy.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 04:13AM ET</span>",China factory sector hurt in September as trade frictions bite,"By Kevin Yao and Lusha Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September as both external and domestic demand weakened, two surveys showed on Sunday, raising the pressure on policymakers as U.S. tariffs appear to be inflicting a heavier toll on the Chinese economy. 
A private survey showed growth in the factory sector stalled after 15 months of expansion, with export orders falling the fastest in over two years, while an official survey confirmed a further manufacturing weakening.
Taken together, the business activity gauges - the first major readings on China's economy for September - confirm consensus views that the world's second-largest economy is continuing to cool, which is likely to prompt Chinese policymakers to roll out more growth-support measures in coming months.
""We should make policy preparations as the external pressure on the economy is rising and it will increase further next year,"" said Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai.
Some cushion for the slowing economy might come from services, which account for more than half of China's economy. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday, showed services expanded at a faster rate in September. 
For manufacturing, the official index fell to a seven-month low of 50.8 in September, from 51.3 in August and below a Reuters poll forecast of 51.2. That index has stayed above the 50-point mark, which divides expansion from contraction, 26 straight months.
But the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell more than expected to 50.0 from 50.6 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 50.5 on average.
For the private survey, September was the first time China's factories had not seen business improve since May 2017, when activity contracted.
SHRINKING NEW EXPORT ORDERS
The official data covers a much larger number of companies, while the private poll focuses more on small and medium-sized firms, which are vital to China's job creation. Chinese officials have pledged to prevent extensive job losses as trade risks mount. 
In the Caixin survey, new export orders - an indicator of future activity - contracted at the fastest pace since February 2016, with companies attributing the shrinking orders to trade frictions and subsequent tariffs. 
In the official survey, the new export orders sub-index fell to 48.0 from 49.4 in August, contracting for a fourth straight month. 
""Expansion across the manufacturing sector weakened in September, as exports increasingly dragged down performance and continued softening demand began to have an impact on companies' production,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
""Downward pressure on China's economy was significant,"" said Zhong.
Tang of Bank of Communications said he expects China's economic growth to slow to 6.6 percent in the third quarter from 6.7 percent in April-June.
LONG FIGHT AHEAD?
The Trump administration has pointed to growing signs of economic weakness in China and its slumping stock markets as proof that the United States is winning the trade war, but Beijing has remained defiant, vowing to stimulate domestic demand to cushion the blow from any trade shocks.
Washington slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 24 and is threatening to impose duties on virtually all of the goods China exports to the United States.
Plans for fresh trade talks collapsed in recent weeks, and both sides appear to be digging in for a long fight, casting a pall over the outlook for global economic growth.
Long Guoqiang, deputy head of the Chinese Cabinet's think tank the Development Research Centre, told reporters on Sunday the impact of the tariffs on some exporters would be harsh.
""Some will cut production, some will cut workers, and some may even shut down,"" Long said.
While China's official export data has proved surprisingly resilient so far, many analysts believe companies have been rushing out shipments to the United States to beat successive rounds of tariffs, raising the risk of a sharp drop off once duties are actually imposed. The deepening slump in export orders may be bearing that theory out.
Export-reliant Chinese cities and provinces are already showing the strain. Guangdong, China's biggest province by gross domestic product, reported a drop in exports in the first eight months from a year earlier. 
Demand in China had already been slowing before the U.S. trade row flared, as a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending and debt started to push up companies' borrowing costs. Fixed-asset investment growth has sunk to a record low.
Policymakers have shifted focus in recent months to growth boosting measures to cushion the economy and weather the trade storm. They have sought to bring financing costs down, boost lending to smaller businesses, cut taxes and fast-track more infrastructure projects.
But analysts note it will take some time for such measures to put a floor under the slowing economy, with some predicting things will get worse before they get better.
China is likely to place increased hopes on its services sector, with rising wages for people in it giving consumers more spending power. The official PMI index for September put services at 54.9, the highest level since June, from 54.2 in August. 

The central bank has cut banks' reserve requirement ratios three times this year to pump out more liquidity, with more reductions widely expected.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 03:34PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending rises, monthly inflation moderates","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased steadily in August, supporting expectations of solid economic growth in the third quarter, while a measure of underlying inflation remained at the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for a fourth straight month.
Economists said Friday's report from the Commerce Department should allay fears of the economy overheating and likely keeps the U.S. central bank on a gradual path of interest rate increases. The Fed raised rates on Wednesday for the third time this year and removed the reference to monetary policy remaining ""accommodative.""
""Growth is solid and inflation pressures modest,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""This is exactly the environment the Fed needs to move interest rates up at a gradual pace as further rate hikes start to look like tightening.""
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.3 percent last month after an unrevised 0.4 percent gain in July. Spending last month was driven by outlays on healthcare, which offset a drop in motor vehicle purchases.
August's increase in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent after climbing 0.3 percent in July.
The report came on the heels of data on Thursday showing a decline in orders for key capital goods in August and a further widening of the goods trade deficit, which prompted economists to downgrade their gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter to as low as a 2.8 percent annualized rate. 
Third-quarter GDP growth forecasts were previously as high as a 4.4 percent pace. 
The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter, powered by robust consumer spending. Economists said data in hand suggested that consumer spending was on track to grow at about a 3.6 percent rate in the third quarter, close to the 3.8 percent pace set in the April-June period.
Consumer spending is being driven by a tightening labor market, which is starting to boost wage growth, as well as higher savings. It is also being supported by robust consumer confidence. 
A separate report on Friday showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index at a six-month high in September. A survey earlier this week from the Conference Board showed consumer confidence hitting an 18-year high in September. The Conference Board places more weight on the labor market. 
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed in late afternoon trade.
EYES ON TARIFFS
In August, spending on goods increased 0.3 percent, likely lifted by higher gasoline prices. Spending on goods rose 0.5 percent in July. Outlays on services advanced 0.4 percent, with spending on healthcare accounting for much of the increase.
There was a moderation in monthly price gains in August. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components was unchanged. That was the weakest reading since March 2017 and followed a 0.2 percent gain in July.
August's flat reading left the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 2.0 percent. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.
Economists say inflation could slightly overshoot its target amid concerns an escalating trade war between the United States and China could lead to price increase for a range of consumer goods. 
Washington on Monday slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT), the largest U.S. retailer, said last week it might hike prices because of the duties on Chinese imports.
""With this $200 billion increase, you are effectively tripling the amount of goods subject to a tariff and that has potential to influence prices,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates that the tariffs could add 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point to core inflation.

In August, personal income rose 0.3 percent after increasing by the same margin in July. Wages jumped 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in seven months, after rising 0.3 percent in July. The saving rate was unchanged at 6.6 percent last month.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to have slipped to 51.2 in September from 51.3 in August, according to the median forecast of 23 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
As U.S. tariffs threaten to put more pressure on China's already slowing economy, policymakers in recent months have sought to boost lending to businesses, cut taxes and fast-track big infrastructure projects.
They hope such measures will prop up growth and offset the drag from an ongoing government crackdown on riskier financing.
But analysts note it will take some time for policy support to put a floor under the slowing economy, with some predicting things will get worse before they get better.
Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed to a five-month low in August as demand cooled, data showed on Thursday.
""China's economy continued to slow despite intensive policy easing and stimulus measures in recent months,"" wrote Nomura analysts in a note. 
""In our view, the room for Beijing to step up its conventional stimulus measures – which rely on pumping credit and ramping up infrastructure spending – is rather limited,"" they said, arguing bigger tax cuts are needed to spur firms' confidence and reduce their costs.
In recent weeks, state-controlled media has churned out editorials assuring the public that despite the pressure on the economy, steady consumption and infrastructure investment will keep risks in check.
China says the diversification of overseas markets will also help exporters counter the trade war with the United States. 
On the ground, trade-dependent cities and provinces including Guangdong in the south are already scrambling to provide relief to exporters.
Exports from Guangdong's Zhongshan, for example, slumped 21.3 percent in the first half, with shipments to the United States diving 19 percent. 
Zhongshan, at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta, is among a handful of Chinese cities that are heavily dependent on the United States for their exports and have yet to diversify their markets.
Another round of tit-for-tat tariffs went into effect on Monday, with the U.S. imposing duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. Several rounds of talks have produced no breakthroughs and both sides look to be digging in for a lengthy battle.
Separately, a private survey on China's factory activity is forecast to show a similar mild easing trend.
The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) is expected to have fallen slightly to 50.5 in September versus 50.6 in August.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 12:05PM ET</span>","U.S. capital goods orders, trade data temper third-quarter growth forecasts","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell in August after four straight months of strong gains and the goods trade deficit widened sharply, prompting some economists to significantly lower their economic growth estimates for the third quarter.
Still, growth projections for the quarter remained at lofty levels, with other data on Thursday showing increased investment in wholesale and retail inventories last month. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, and Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that this was ""a particularly bright moment"" for the economy.
""Third-quarter GDP growth is less boomy, more noisy,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.5 percent last month as demand for computers and electronic products as well as motor vehicles ebbed.
The so-called core capital goods orders rose 1.5 percent in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders for these goods rising 0.4 percent last month. Core capital goods orders increased 7.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods edged up 0.1 percent last month after jumping 1.1 percent in July. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
With business confidence at multi-year highs, in part buoyed by a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, August's surprise drop in core capital goods orders is likely to be temporary. But economists worry an escalating trade war between the United States and China could hurt confidence and undercut spending.
Washington on Monday slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods. 
While manufacturers have expressed concerns about the tariffs, which are contributing to bottlenecks in the supply chain, there are so far no indications from economic data that the trade tensions are having a big impact on the economy.
""The big wild card for business investment is how the trade tariffs and persistent policy uncertainty affect capital expenditures,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. Macro Investor Services at Oxford Economics in New York.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher and U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly. 
EXPORTS DECLINE
The Commerce Department confirmed in a second report on Thursday that the economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. That was the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace set in the first quarter. 
A third report from the Commerce Department showed the goods trade deficit rose $3.8 billion to $75.8 billion in August.
Exports of goods fell 1.6 percent to $137.9 billion, weighed down by a 9.5 percent plunge in shipments of food, feeds and beverages. That likely reflected a continued reversal of soybean exports after farmers front-loaded shipments of the crop in April and May to China before Beijing's retaliatory tariffs came into effect in early July. 
Exports of industrial supplies and motor vehicles also declined last month. There was, however, a surge in exports of consumer and other goods. Imports of goods increased 0.7 percent to $213.7 billion in August, driven by motor vehicles, consumer and other goods. 
Economists said importers were likely stockpiling goods before the U.S. duties on Chinese imports became effective.
A smaller trade deficit added 1.2 percentage point to GDP growth in the second quarter, but a reversal is expected in the July-September period.
The expected drag could, however, be partly offset by increased investment in inventories. Wholesale inventories jumped 0.8 percent in August and stocks at retailers rose 0.7 percent, the Commerce Department reported.
Taking Thursday data into account, JPMorgan lowered its third-quarter GDP growth estimate by five-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.0 percent rate. The Atlanta Fed slashed its forecast to a 3.8 percent rate from a 4.4 percent pace. 
The outlook for the economy remains upbeat amid a robust labor market. In a fourth report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted level of 214,000 last week.

That was likely as Hurricane Florence temporarily displaced some workers. Claims fell to 202,000 during the week ended Sept. 15, which was the lowest level since November 1969.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, declined 1.8 percent to a reading of 104.2 amid an inventory shortage and a rise in prices that has sidelined many buyers.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales falling 0.4 percent in August. It was the fourth decline in the last five months.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two and are therefore seen as a good indicator of future existing home sales. Data last week showed that existing home sales, like the broader housing market, have ebbed despite overall strength in the U.S. economy.
""With prices having risen so quickly, many consumers were deciding to wait to list their homes hoping to see additional price and equity gains,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement.

In August, contracts dropped 5.9 percent in the West and were down 1.3 percent in the Northeast. They dipped 0.5 percent in the Midwest and 0.7 percent in the South.

Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2 percent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third estimate of GDP growth for the April-June quarter. That was the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and unchanged from the estimate published in August. 
The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the January-March period. Upward revisions to spending on residential structures and on nondurable goods like gasoline was offset by a downgrade to inventory investment.
The economy expanded 3.2 percent in the first half of 2018. Growth in the second quarter was driven by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which boosted consumer spending after it almost stalled early in the year. 

There was a front-loading to soybean exports to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs, which also powered growth. Economists had expected second-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at a 4.2 percent pace.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",U.S. September auto sales seen down 6 percent: J.D. Power and LMC,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in September likely fell 6 percent from the same month last year as dealerships felt the mixed impact of hurricanes both this year and in 2017, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday.
September U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.43 million units, down from 1.52 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 18 selling days of September. Automakers, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), will release September U.S. sales results on Oct. 2.
General Motors Co (N:GM) will report quarterly sales the same day. The No. 1 U.S. automaker decided earlier this year to stop reporting monthly U.S. sales, saying a 30-day snapshot does not accurately reflect market conditions. 
According to the consultancies, sales in North Carolina and South Carolina were down 12 percent in September due to Hurricane Florence, while sales were up 19 percent in areas affected by Hurricane Irma in September 2017.
Sales in September 2017 were also boosted by major replacement demand for water-damaged vehicles following Hurricane Harvey, which flooded parts of southeastern Texas in August 2017.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales for September will be 17.4 million units, down nearly 4 percent from 18.1 million units in September 2017 - the highest sales pace since 2005 - the consultancies said.
U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to around 17.2 million units after hitting a record high in 2016.
Sales had originally been expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones. 
But with a strong U.S. economy and low unemployment, sales thus far have outperformed expectations. 
LMC said it now expects full-year 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales to come in at around 17.2 million units, or virtually flat versus last year, after originally forecasting a full-year decline.
""Trade and rising interest rate risk remain real factors in the background,"" LMC president for the Americas and global vehicle forecasts Jeff Schuster said in a statement. 
Cox Automotive, owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, said this week it expects sales to fall 7.2 percent in September to 1.41 million units.

Industry consultant and car shopping website Edmunds expects sales to fall 8.3 percent to 1.39 million new cars and trucks.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted level of 214,000 for the week ended Sept. 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Claims fell to 202,000 during the week ended Sept. 15, which was the lowest level since November 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 210,000 in the latest week. Hurricane Florence lashed parts of the South last week, causing flooding and sending people into emergency shelters. 
The Labor Department reported an increase in unadjusted claims for South and North Carolina last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 250 to 206,250 last week.
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. It continues to strengthen, with non-farm payrolls increasing by 201,000 jobs in August and annual wage growth notching its biggest gain in more than nine years. Job openings hit an all-time high of 6.9 million in July.
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, describing the labor market as having ""continued to strengthen"" and job gains as having ""been strong, on average.""
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 16,000 to 1.66 million for the week ended Sept. 15. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 12,250 to 1.68 million, the lowest level since November 1973.

The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which September's unemployment rate will be derived. The four-week average of continuing claims fell between the August and September survey periods, suggesting some improvement in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate was at 3.9 percent in August.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.5 percent last month, pulled down by a decline in demand for computers and electronic products. 
There was also a decrease in motor vehicle orders. Data for July was revised slightly lower to show the so-called core capital goods orders increasing 1.5 percent instead of the previously reported 1.6 percent surge.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.4 percent last month. Core capital goods orders increased 7.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods edged up 0.1 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.1 percent gain in July. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They were previously reported to have increased 1.0 percent in July.
With business confidence at multi-year highs, in part buoyed by a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, August's surprise drop in core capital goods orders is likely to be temporary. There are, however, fears that an escalating trade war between the United States and China could hurt confidence and undercut both consumer and business spending.
Washington on Monday slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The U.S. and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods.

Business spending on equipment has risen since the fourth quarter of 2016. It is expected to underpin economic growth in the third quarter, even as trade is expected to weigh on output.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, surged 4.5 percent in August as demand for transportation equipment jumped 13.0 percent. That followed a 1.2 percent drop in durable goods orders in July.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 1.0 percent last month. Orders for civilian aircraft soared 69.1 percent last month. Boeing (N:BA) reported on it website that it had received 99 aircraft orders in August, up from 25 in July.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The euro zone's economy is continuing to hum along but growing global trade tensions are starting to take their toll on the morale of consumers and entrepreneurs, data showed on Thursday.
The euro area has seen five straight years of economic expansion, fueled by massive stimulus by the European Central Bank and an upturn in the global economy.
Clouds have been forming on the horizon, however, as the United States and China threaten to unleash a global trade war while worries about Italy's public finances have rattled investors.
For now, banks in the euro zone are keeping the money taps open, with the pace of growth in credit to households and companies rising to another post-crisis high in August, ECB lending data showed on Thursday.
But sentiment indicators from the European Commission laid bare growing unease among industrialists, who have revised down their production expectations this month, and consumers, who are growing less optimistic about their financial and employment situation.
A broader index of economic sentiment fell for the 9th straight month in September and fell short of economists' expectation.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and various Chinese products, triggering retaliation from Beijing.
The ECB warned that an expanding trade conflict among major economic powers could weigh on sentiment further.
""In the near term, global economic momentum is expected to moderate,"" the ECB said in a bulletin.
""Further tariff increases and uncertainties about future trading relations are likely to weigh on global economic momentum going forward,"" it added.
Germany's leading economic institutes also said any escalation of trade friction involving the United States could cause a major recession in Germany and Europe.
GROGGY MOOD
European share markets and the euro both were taking a tumble on Thursday as Italy's new government struggled to contain a fierce internal battle over fiscal policy, compounding an already groggy global mood after the third U.S. interest rate rise of the year.
Unlike in 2012 and 2015, when the ECB intervened to claw the euro zone back from the brink, this time the central bank may have a harder time coming to the rescue.
Price growth in the euro zone, the ECB's sole official goal, is slowly heading toward its target of almost 2 percent, and the institution has laid out plans to tighten the purse strings.
It intends to end its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.05 trillion) bond-buying program at the end of this year and even expects to raise interest rates from their current, record-low levels in late 2018.
Inflation data from the German states of Hesse and Bayer (DE:BAYGN) on Thursday confirmed price growth in the euro zone's largest economy was likely on the up, suggesting the ECB's hands may be tied.
""The ECB has very limited room to accommodate these problems, and some of these (global) dynamics support the ongoing euro area inflation recovery,"" Peter Chatwell, an analyst at brokerage Mizuho, said.

The growth was the slowest pace since March and marked the fourth straight month of slowing growth. Citing analysts from Capital Economics, Reuters said markets had expected a 15.5% increase for August.
“It is difficult to find an excuse not to blame the trade war,” said Iris Pang, ING economist.
Escalating trade tensions with the U.S. were said to be hurting China’s economy. On Wednesday, the country’s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said Beijing would resume trade talks only if the U.S. showed sincerity and did not put a knife to China’s throat.
Wang then added that the two sides were set to have four rounds of talks but the U.S. went back on what they had agreed.
His comments came after the U.S. and China imposed fresh tariffs on each other's goods on Monday, although the initial level of the duties was not as high as had been previously expected.
“Looking ahead, we continue to see headwinds to industrial profit growth in the rest of the year, based on our expectation of gradual moderation in industrial production growth, as well as potentially slower [producer price] inflation,” Goldman Sachs analysts said."
994,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 01:02AM ET</span>","China's industrial profit growth hits five-month low, points to cooler demand","BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed to a five-month low in August, fanning concerns about faltering domestic demand in the world's second-largest economy as escalating trade frictions with the United States cloud its outlook.
Demand for raw materials and industrial products has taken a hit this year as business expansion plans slowed, restrained by tighter funding due to China's multi-year campaign to curb corporate debt and crack down on risky borrowing. A softer property market has also sapped construction-related demand.
Industrial profits rose 9.2 percent in August to 519.69 billion yuan ($76 billion), data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday. The pace of growth slowed for a fourth straight month and almost halved from the 16.2 percent gain in July. 
Last month's slowdown was mainly due to a double whammy of slower revenue and factory price gains, the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data release.
""Corporate profitability will continue to worsen, as the recent policy boost to spur investment growth will take time to set in,"" said Yang Yewei, an analyst at Southwest Securities. He noted both inventories and money owed to companies had edged up, a sign that business conditions were becoming increasingly challenging.
The profit slowdown points to persistently weakening demand under the ongoing deleveraging campaign, despite policymakers shifting their focus to growth-boosting strategies. These measures include accelerating approvals for infrastructure projects and financing support for the private sector.
Taxes and fees are being cut while banks have been told to keep credit lines open to firms hit by the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
The profit growth in August was the slowest since March, when profits expanded 3.1 percent. Analysts from Capital Economics had forecast a 15.5 percent increase for August. 
Upstream sectors such as mining and metal producers and state-owned firms still commanded the lion's share of profit gains but their growth softened notably in August. Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms rose 26.7 percent year-on-year in January-August versus a 30.5 percent increase in the first seven months.
The biggest slowdown in growth came from oil and gas production and ferrous metal smeltering, whose year-on-year growth in January-August were 11 and 17.2 percentage points lower from January-July, respectively.
For the first eight months of the year, industrial firms notched up profits of 4.4 trillion yuan, a 16.2 percent increase from the same period last year, lower from 17.1 percent growth in January-July, the statistics bureau said on Thursday. 
SLOWING TREND
The latest quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International suggested both revenue and profit growth slowed in July-September from the previous quarter, and only retailers and commodities companies saw improved margins.
The survey cautioned there are ""alarming"" parallels with the sudden slowdown in China in 2015, with companies continuing to borrow heavily even as the economy weakens and before any meaningful U.S. tariffs kicked in. 
As of the end of August, industrial firms' liabilities grew 6.6 percent from a year earlier to 62.8 trillion yuan, compared with an increase of 6.5 percent by end-July. 
Slowing corporate profits will put pressure on jobs, ultimately tapping the brakes on household consumption and hurting overall growth.
Fitch Ratings has cut its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for China next year to 6.1 percent from 6.3 percent. Some economists' measures suggest growth is already well below 6 percent. 
The latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs could further hurt China's already slowing economy. 
The United States and China imposed fresh tariffs on each other's goods on Monday as both sides showed no signs of backing down from an increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to hit global economic growth.
Commodity-related and component manufacturing sectors are most immediately exposed to the new U.S. tariffs, Moody's said in a report on Tuesday, particularly those related to electronic products, consumer appliances, furniture and vehicle parts. 
Some analysts say producer prices - an important gauge of profitability - could prove more resilient than expected due to domestic and global factors.
The producer price index increased 4.1 percent in August, slowing from the previous month's 4.6 percent growth but beating expectations for a 4.0 percent rise.

The median pay award increase returned to an annual 2.5 percent, in line with the 12-month average, from 2.3 percent in the three months to July, wage data firm XpertHR said.
""This follows seven years where pay awards hovered around the 2 percent mark,"" XpertHR said.
The Bank of England is watching wages closely after it said domestic inflation pressures were likely to require further increases in borrowing costs, even as Britain's economy grows only slowly ahead of Brexit. 
XpertHR - which collects details of pay settlements for around 1,600 employee groups each year - said it sampled 91 pay awards in the three months to the end of August covering almost 1.4 million employees.

The 2.5 percent increase roughly matched inflation over the three months to August, as measured by the consumer price index. Many households have seen their spending power eroded over the past decade by inflation rising more quickly than their pay.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 02:32PM ET</span>","U.S. new home sales rebound, but trend weakening","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded in August after two straight monthly declines, but the underlying trend still pointed to a weakening housing market against the backdrop of rising mortgage rates and higher home prices.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales rebounded 3.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629,000 units last month. July's sales pace was revised down to 608,000 units from the previously reported 627,000 units.
Sales in June were also much weaker than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11 percent of housing market sales, rising 0.5 percent to a pace of 630,000 units in August.
""Despite the August increase, sales are still on a downward trend after peaking in November of last year,"" said Andres Carbacho-Burgos, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They increased 12.7 percent from a year ago. 
While economists expect small gains in new homes sales in the coming months, they believe the overall housing market has likely peaked. The housing market is lagging a robust economy, with data last week showing sales of previously owned homes flat in August and building permits hitting a more than one-year low.
RISING MORTGAGE RATES
Economists blame the weakness on rising borrowing costs and house prices, which have outstripped wage growth, making home purchasing unaffordable for some first-time buyers.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has increased more than 60 basis points this year to an average of 4.65 percent. House prices rose 5.9 percent in July from a year ago, data showed on Tuesday. In contrast, annual wage growth has been stuck below 3 percent, though it has recently shown signs of picking up. 
With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, mortgage rates are likely to rise further. The U.S. central bank foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading lower, bucking a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell.
Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year and is expected to decline further in the third quarter. Some analysts said the housing market weakness could be flagging a slowdown in economic activity.
""Residential investment tends to be an early indicator of a more general slowing in growth,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""A rate-related slowdown in housing may be interpreted by Fed officials as an early indication that interest rates are no longer accommodative.""
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, fell 1.7 percent in August. Sales jumped 9.1 percent in the West and climbed 2.7 percent in the Midwest. They soared 47.8 percent in the Northeast, which is the smallest segment of the new housing market.
The median new house price rose 1.9 percent to $320,200 in August from a year ago. There were 318,000 new homes on the market in August, the most since February 2009 and up 1.6 percent from July. Supply is, however, just over half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom in 2006.
A survey last week showed confidence among single-family homebuilders steady in September. While builders welcomed a decline in lumber prices from record highs earlier this year, they said they ""still need to manage construction costs to keep homes competitively priced.""
At August's sales pace it would take 6.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.2 months in July. Nearly two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

""The housing recovery is entering a new stage,"" said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York. ""There is still room for single family construction to expand, but it is likely to remain slow given challenges finding labor and dislocations in the market.""

The Fed removed its use of ""accommodative"" to describe its stance on monetary policy. There was much debate about whether removal of that key phrase was hawkish or dovish, but the Fed chief poured some cold water on the speculation.
""The change does not signal any change in the likely path of policy,"" Powell said at his press conference. ""Instead it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations.""

""The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced,"" the statement said. ""In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent.""
Members of the rate-setting committee kept their 2018 median forecast for interest rates unchanged at 2.4%, suggesting a December rate hike remained in play, which would take the total rate hikes in 2018 to four. The outlook on rates for both 2019 and 2020 were also maintained at 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively.
""The median interest rate forecast 'dot' continues to anticipate another hike in December -- albeit with more (members supporting the view) than in the last set of dots in June -- another three hikes next year, and one more hike in 2020; the first look at the 2021 dots indicates policy rates expected to be on hold at 3.375%,"" JPMorgan said.
The odds of a December rate hike slipped below 80% after the announcement, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor tool.
In a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy, members of the rate-setting committee raised their economic growth projection for this year, forecasting U.S. economic growth of 3.1% in 2018, an increase from the previous projection of 2.8% in June. The growth outlook for 2019 was hiked by 10 basis points to 2.5%, but 2020's was unchanged.
The Federal Reserve left its outlook on inflation unchanged, forecasting core-PCE inflation outlook for 2018 at 2.0%. While Core-PCE Inflation for 2019 and 2020 was left unchanged at 2.1%.
The central bank's unchanged outlook on inflation comes as the most recent reading of the core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, came in at 2%, though the central bank has signalled that it was somewhat comfortable with inflation running above target.
The tightness in the labor market is expected to ease in 2018, with the unemployment rate expected at 3.7%, up from a prior forecast of 3.6%. The central bank forecasts the unemployment rate for both 2019 and 2020 at 3.5%, in line with a previous estimate.
The U.S. dollar index sold off quickly following the statement. That could be due to some bets that the removal of ""accommodative"" in the statement indicates that the Fed was getting closer to a neutral rate -- one that neither stimulates the economy, nor constrains the economy -- indicating less urgency for tightening. Some analysts said, however, that it was ""stretch"" to suggest the tweak in language was dovish.
""We had anticipated this (the removal of accommodative), based on what we thought were strong clues in the most recent FOMC minutes, though this change was debated by analysts. Some would read this change as dovish, though we think that’s a stretch,"" JPMorgan said.
Powell downplayed the prospect of stronger inflation prompting the Fed to adopt a faster pace of monetary policy.
""The main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker if inflation surprises to the upside. We don't see that,"" Powell said."

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 12:57PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence hits 18-year high; house prices slowing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence surged to an 18-year high in September as households grew more upbeat about the labor market, pointing to sustained strength in the economy despite an increasingly bitter trade dispute between the United States and China.
While other data on Tuesday showed a moderation in house price increases in July, the gains probably remain sufficient to boost household wealth and continue to support consumer spending, as well as making home purchasing a bit more affordable for first-time buyers.
""The consumer is always in the driver's seat when it comes to stoking the fires that run the engines of economic growth, but the million dollar question is what is going to happen down the road when the trade tariffs start to bite?"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 138.4 this month from an upwardly revised 134.7 in August. That was the best reading since September 2000 and the index is not too far from an all-time high of 144.7 reached that year.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer index slipping to a reading of 132.0 this month from the previously reported 133.4 in August. 
Consumers' assessment of labor market conditions improved sharply even as the trade war between the United States and China escalated, which economists warned would lead to job losses and higher prices for consumers. 
Washington on Monday slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The United States and China had already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods.
For now, consumers appear to be shrugging off the trade tensions. Households were this month upbeat about business conditions over the next six months, with many planning purchases of household appliances, motor vehicles and houses. 
Some economists believe a tightening labor market, which is starting to boost wage growth, and higher savings could provide a cushion for households against more expensive consumer goods imports from China. 
""Moreover, consumers may choose to substitute purchases of goods affected by tariffs with other goods and firms may choose to absorb the higher costs,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York.
STRONG LABOR MARKET
The Conference Board consumer survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, rose to 32.5 in September, the highest level since January 2001, from 30.2 in August.
This measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department' employment report, is pointing to further declines in the jobless rate and labor market slack. The labor market is viewed as either at or near full employment, with the jobless rate at 3.9 percent.
The robust labor market, together with the strong economy and steadily rising inflation, have left economists confident that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year.
The dollar was trading slightly weaker against a basket of currencies, while U.S. government bond yields rose. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed.
The consumer confidence report added to fairly upbeat data on consumer spending and manufacturing that have suggested solid economic growth in the third quarter. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are above a 3.0 percent pace.
While the broader economy is powering ahead, the housing market is continuing to lag behind amid signs that higher mortgage rates and house prices are starting to hurt demand.
Separately, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 U.S. metropolitan areas rose 5.9 percent in July from a year ago after increasing 6.4 percent in June.
Prices in the 20 cities edged up 0.1 percent in July from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, the survey showed. 
The moderation in house price inflation was also underscored by another report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which showed its home price index rising 0.2 percent in July after gaining 0.3 percent in June. 
The FHFA’s index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

""Consumers are delirious but not bidding up prices of homes as much as they had been,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Increasing prices and mortgage rates are reducing affordability and sales and that is translating into slower price gains.""

The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence rose to 138.4, compared to a reading of 132.2 forecast by economists, according to data released on Tuesday. The measure had risen to a revised 134.7 in the previous month.
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
“The September reading is not far from the all-time high of 144.7 reached in 2000. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions remains extremely favorable, bolstered by a strong economy and robust job growth,"" said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board.
""These historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending, and should be welcome news for retailers as they begin gearing up for the holiday season,"" she added."
1002,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>","Trump, Brexit hit German growth, xenophobia also a threat","By Michael Nienaber and Gernot Heller
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's BDI industry association on Tuesday lowered its 2018 growth forecast and warned of a potential downturn, citing weaker demand for German exports due to U.S. trade policy and Brexit, as well a threat to the economy from xenophobia at home.
The German economy is now expected to grow by 2.0 percent this year, down from a previous estimate of 2.25 percent, BDI President Dieter Kempf said. Exports will rise by 3.5 percent in real terms, below an initial forecast of 5 percent.
The predictions of slower growth were reinforced by Germany's economic institutes. Two government sources familiar with a report to be released later this week said the institutes would cut their 2018 forecast to 1.7 percent from 2.2 percent.
In an unusually strong intervention into domestic politics, the BDI's Kempf warned that the German economy could be hurt by a wave of nationalism, after violent protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz that followed a stabbing blamed on migrants.
""An allegedly homeland-loving nationalism that declares everything foreign an enemy is wrong,"" he said. ""It poses a threat to the business model of our industry which is based on openness - and it's jeopardizing prosperity and employment.""
""PREPARE NOW""
While Europe's biggest economy has been growing for nine years and could continue expanding, Kempf said it was urgent that Germans now take steps to prepare for the possibility of a downturn: ""We have to take precautions - now."" 
The BDI called for lower corporate taxes, higher public investment in education and digital infrastructure as well as a completion of the European Union's single market by harmonizing rules in areas such as services, energy and digital business.
""The trade policy of U.S. President Trump, but also the approaching Brexit are dampening investment activity worldwide and with it German export business,"" Kempf said.
At its event in Berlin, the BDI hosted Chancellor Angela Merkel and World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevedo, both of whom spoke out strongly in defense of a trade system that Germany sees as threatened by U.S. policy.
Merkel told business leaders that the WTO was facing ""huge challenges"", and criticized a U.S. decision to block the appointment of WTO judges: ""If there are no new judges appointed, of course, that's also an undermining (of the WTO).""
Azevedo said he was counting on Germany and the European Union to support efforts to safeguard the rules-based free trade order. ""Of course, the system can be better, in fact it must be better,"" Azevedo said, pointing to reform proposals to address trade-distorting practices.
The German economy, with its export-oriented manufacturing sector and an overall export quota of nearly 50 percent, faces a threat from global business and trade uncertainty, Kempf said.
China is Germany's most important trading partner and the United States is its biggest single export destination. An escalating tit-for-tat tariffs dispute between Washington and Beijing is therefore hitting German exporters as well.
""The United States and China must urgently de-escalate the conflict,"" Kempf said, adding it was high time to strengthen the WTO by modernizing its rules framework.
The German growth outlook is also clouded by an impasse in Britain's negotiations with its European Union partners over the conditions of its departure from the bloc next March.
Kempf said there must be a breakthrough on getting a Brexit deal in the coming weeks to ensure a transition period that would give firms legal certainty until the end of 2020.

Britain still has to decide exactly what it wants out of negotiations with the EU on Brexit, Merkel said. The centre-bit leader added that six to eight weeks of hard work lie ahead to reach a possible deal in October.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 06:25AM ET</span>",Germany on track for solid growth as business morale holds steady,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Business morale held steady in Germany in September, propped up by consumer spending and construction, a survey showed, to leave the country on track for further growth even if a uncertain global economic outlook worsens.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute's business climate index edged down to 103.7 on Monday from an upwardly revised 103.9 in August. That beat a Reuters consensus forecast of 103.2.
""Despite growing uncertainty, the German economy remains robust,"" said Ifo chief Clemens Fuest, pointing to improved sentiment in retailing and a record-high reading in the building industry.
But the manufacturing sub-index dipped and companies scaled back their overall expectations slightly, suggesting a growing trade row between Washington and Beijing is weighing on exporters.
The growth outlook is also clouded by an impasse in Britain's negotiations with its European Union partners over the conditions of its departure from the bloc next March.
""Despite the good mood, uncertainty is gradually growing among companies,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has said the economy was likely to grow around 2 percent this year. That would be less than both the government's forecast of 2.3 percent and the calendar-adjusted growth rate of 2.5 percent reached last year.
GROWTH, BUT AT A SLOWER PACE
As momentum in exports, its traditional engine of growth, slows, household spending and construction have become increasingly important drivers for Europe's biggest economy.
Unemployment is at record lows and German consumers are reaping the benefits of rising real wages and cheap credit due to the euro zone's expansive monetary policy.
The Ifo survey showed business sentiment improved in all sectors other than manufacturing.
Fuest said managers viewed their current business situation a bit less favorably than in August, but that that sub-index remained at a relatively high level. 
The Ifo figures chimed with a survey among purchasing managers published last week that showed private sector growth slowed in September as a surge in services activity was not enough to offset a sharp slowdown in manufacturing.
Andreas Scheuerle from DekaBank said the uncertainty caused by the U.S.-Sino trade dispute was dampening demand for German industrial goods.
""The economy is doing well but growth is limited,"" Joerg Zeuner, chief economist of KfW bank said.

""A domestic economy that continues to be strong is set against a somewhat stuttering demand from abroad, which is being felt in particular by industry,"" he added.

However, the manufacturing PMI rose to 55.6 in September, compared to 54.7 a month earlier.

“With storms hitting the east coast, it was no surprise to see some disappointing survey data in September, with the flash PMI indicating that the pace of economic growth slipped to its lowest for almost one-and-a-half years,” IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said.
Despite the slowdown, this expert considered business activity to remain “encouragingly resilient” and estimated that the data implied third-quarter growth of about 3%.
Williamson pointed to an acceleration in new order growth and an increase in backlogs of work due to weather-related disruptions and said that “underlying demand remains robust and that there’s an accumulation of work that will roll over into stronger economic growth in coming months.”
He also noted that the upturn in hiring suggested that nonfarm payroll creation could top 200,000 in September.

A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction
The manufacturing PMI fell to 53.3 compared to expectations for 54.4 and from 54.6 a month earlier.
The preliminary reading of the IHS Markit services purchasing managers’ index came in at 54.7 this month from 54.4 in August.
Economists had forecast a reading of 54.4.
The report highlighted that euro zone business activity grew in September at the second-weakest rate since late-2016, as manufacturing growth was subdued by export orders stagnating for the first time in over five years.
“Trade wars, Brexit, waning global demand (notably in the auto industry), growing risk aversion, destocking and rising political uncertainty both within the Eurozone and further afield all fueled the slowdown in business activity,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
Thanks to activity in the service sector, Williamson predicts that the euro area economy will grow 0.5% in the third quarter.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 55.3 from 55.6 the previous month.
This undershot the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists who had expected a slowdown to 55.4. Still, it was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Manufacturing growth slowed to reach its lowest level in more than two years, the survey showed, with the respective sub-index falling to 53.7 from 55.9. Analysts had expected a smaller drop to 55.7.
New export orders in manufacturing fell below the survey's crucial 50 mark for the first time since July 2015 and purchasing managers scaled back their expectations for future output.
""The service sector was left to do most of the heavy lifting in September, as manufacturing put in its worst overall performance since August 2016,"" said Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit. ""Manufacturing new orders, however, were broadly flat as export sales declined for the first time in more than three years."" 
Services business activity increased unexpectedly. Markit's sub-index for the sector rose to 56.5 from 55.0 in the previous month. This was much better than the forecast of analysts who had predicted a stable reading.
Services companies continued to hire staff at a pace not seen in nearly 11 years and their business expectations improved further, the survey showed.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 02:46AM ET</span>","BOJ tankan seen showing manufacturers' mood up slightly, but outlook murky: Reuters poll","By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence among Japan's big manufacturers was expected to have edged up in the three months to September, although trade worries cloud the outlook, a Reuters poll found ahead of the central bank's quarterly sentiment survey.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence rose to plus 22 in September from plus 21 three months ago, the poll of 16 economists showed.
The sentiment index for non-manufacturers was seen slipping to plus 22 from plus 24 in the June survey, the poll found.
The expected deterioration in service-sector sector mood would follow natural disasters such as flooding rains in western Japan and earthquakes in northern Hokkaido that disrupted distribution and tourism. 
""The economy remains solid, but the China-U.S. trade conflict and natural disasters' negative impacts are likely to be felt in the survey,"" said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. 
The BOJ tankan's measure of big manufacturers' business confidence is expected to decline in the coming quarter to plus 19 while non-manufacturers' sentiment is seen deteriorating to plus 20, the Reuters poll found. 
Big companies were seen raising capital spending plans for this fiscal year by 14.2 percent, upgrading from 13.6 percent in the previous tankan survey.
The Bank of Japan will publish its tankan survey results at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday Oct. 1. (2350 GMT on Sept. 30).
The monthly Reuters' Tankan, which tracks the BOJ's quarterly survey, found confidence among Japanese manufacturers slipped in September from August's seven-month high..
FACTORY OUTPUT, TOKYO CORE CPI
Industrial production is seen likely to show a 1.5 percent gain in August from July, rising for the first time in four months. 
Such gains would follow a resumption of vehicle production after July's heavy rains and flooding in western Japan forced some companies to stop work. 
""Exports of autos returned to growth in August and semiconductor-related shipments were solid. We expect factory output rose - led by transport equipment,"" said Hirotaka Yazawa, economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
The trade ministry will publish factory output data at 8:50 a.m. on Friday Sept. 28 (2350 GMT on Sept. 27). 
The Tokyo area's core consumer price index (CPI) likely rose 0.9 percent in September, unchanged from August, the poll found.
The index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, is available a month earlier than the national data.
""Only energy costs contributed to gains in the index but other prices have not shown any acceleration,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Institute.
The poll also found retail sales were expected to have grown 2.1 percent in August from a year earlier, up for 10 straight months, as car sales rose and higher oil prices drove up fuel costs.

The Nikkei Japan Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturers showed a preliminary reading of 52.9 in September, up from 52.5 in August. New orders came in at 53.3, up from 52.4. A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, while one below that signals a contraction.
""Business conditions remained robust despite a number of natural disasters over the past month,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Still, business sentiment dipped further to a 22-month low due to uncertainty about how international trade tensions could impact the Japanese economy, he wrote in the data release.
While Japan’s economy started the year with a contraction, robust business investment helped drive growth at the fastest pace in more than two years during the second quarter. The economy looks to be on solid footing during the current period, despite a series of national disasters.

The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.9 in September on a seasonally adjusted basis from a final 52.5 in August.
The index remained comfortably above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 25th consecutive month.
Total new orders rose at the fastest pace in five months, while export orders returned to expansion territory but only marginally.
But a sub-index measuring expectations for future output fell to a preliminary 55.9, the lowest sentiment reading since November 2016, from a final 57.1 in August.
""Growth in the goods-producing sector continues to be supported by increases in new orders,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""That said, business sentiment dipped further...as firms remain uncertain to how international trade tensions could impact the Japanese economy.""
China and the United States plunged deeper into a trade war on Tuesday after Beijing added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for President Donald Trump's planned levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Japan exports a lot of electronics and manufacturing equipment to China, which are used to make finished products that are shipped to the United States, so a reduction in Chinese exports to the United States could hurt Japanese companies.
The survey also showed Japanese factories were facing the sharpest input cost inflation since March 2011.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million units last month.
It follows four straight months of monthly declines. A dearth of properties for sale has pushed up prices, sidelining many would-be homeowners.
""As long as we have increased inventory, I think the housing market can turn for the better in terms of sales,"" NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said.
Supply has also been constrained by rising building material costs as well as land and labor shortages while rising mortgage rates are expected to slow demand.
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise borrowing costs by a quarter percentage point next Wednesday following its latest interest-rate policy meeting. It would be the third such increase this year.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales increasing 0.3 percent. Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales.
Existing home sales fell 1.5 percent from a year ago. Across the nation's four regions, sales jumped 7.6 percent in the Northeast and there was a rise of 2.4 percent in the Midwest. Sales fell 5.9 percent in the West and 0.4 percent in the South.
There were 1.92 million homes on the market in August, an increase of 2.7 percent from one year ago. It was the first inventory increase in three years on a year-on-year basis.
On Wednesday, data showed housing starts rose 9.2 percent in August as groundbreaking on multifamily units soared, but permits were off 5.7 percent, the biggest decline since February 2017.
At August's sales pace, it would take 4.3 months to clear the current inventory, up from 4.1 months a year ago. A supply of six to seven months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
The median house price increased 4.6 percent from one year ago to $264,800 in August. It was the fourth consecutive month that prices had risen less than 5 percent on a yearly basis, NAR noted.

1015,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Existing Home Sales Hold Steady in August,"Investing.com - Sales of previously-owned U.S. homes unexpectedly registered no change in August, according to figures released by the National Association of Realtors on Thursday.
Existing home sales remained unchanged in August from the previous month at an annualized pace of 5.34 million units.
Economists had forecast a 0.3% increase to an annualized pace of 5.35 million.
Existing home sales account for 90% of the market and are calculated when a contract closes.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says the decline in existing home sales appears to have hit a plateau with robust regional sales.
“Strong gains in the Northeast and a moderate uptick in the Midwest helped to balance out any losses in the South and West, halting months of downward momentum,” Yun said.
“With inventory stabilizing and modestly rising, buyers appear ready to step back into the market,” he added.
The report also detailed that the median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $264,800, up 4.6% from August 2017 ($253,100). August’s price increase marked the 78th-straight month of year-over-year gains.
“While inventory continues to show modest year over year gains, it is still far from a healthy level and new home construction is not keeping up to satisfy demand,” Yun commented.
“Homes continue to fly off the shelves with a majority of properties selling within a month, indicating that more inventory -- especially moderately priced, entry-level homes -- would propel sales,” he concluded."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted level of 201,000 for the week ended Sept. 15, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That is the lowest level since November 1969. Data for the prior week's claims was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 210,000 in the latest week. 
The Labor Department said only claims for Hawaii were estimated last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, declined by 2,250 to 205,750 last week, the lowest level since December 1969. 
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. It continues to strengthen, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 201,000 jobs in August and annual wage growth notching its biggest gain in more than nine years. Job openings hit an all-time high of 6.9 million in July.
Though there have been reports of some companies either planning job cuts or laying off workers because of trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, they have been partially offset by increased hiring in the steel industry.
Economists, however, have warned of job losses if the trade tensions escalate.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 55,000 to 1.645 million for the week ended Sept. 8, the lowest level since August 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 20,750 to 1.691 million, the lowest level since November 1973.

The report underlined expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates two more times this year, with the next move higher coming at its meeting next week.
The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ended Sept. 15 decreased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 201,000 from the previous week’s total of 204,000, the U.S. Department of Labor said.
Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 6,000 to 210,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 205,750, down 2,250 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended Sept. 8 fell to 1.645 million from 1.700 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an increase to 1.705 million.

1020,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Norway Raises Benchmark Rate for First Time in Seven Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in seven years as policy makers in Scandinavia’s richest economy start unwinding the record stimulus put in place to fend off the worst oil crisis in a generation.
Norges Bank increased its benchmark rate by a quarter point to 0.75 percent, as predicted by all 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the decision. The bank flagged it will raise rates again at the start of next year, but also unexpectedly lowered its longer term projections for its key rate. The krone slid 0.8 percent to 9.5899 per euro as of 10:07 a.m.
""The Executive Board’s current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the key policy rate will most likely be increased further in 2019 Q1"" Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement.
The tightening had been flagged since June and comes as the economy of western Europe’s biggest oil producer is nearing capacity with unemployment below 4 percent, crude prices surging and inflation near target. The krone has also been trading near record lows, giving Olsen and his colleagues further room to lift rates.
The Norwegian central bank is now starting on a faster exit from record stimulus than its counterparts in Stockholm and Frankfurt. Backed by record fiscal stimulus from the nation’s $1 trillion wealth fund, Olsen also hasn’t had to cut rates as deeply as elsewhere and hasn’t needed to resort to unconventional policies such as bond purchases.
A surge in crude prices this year has now revived the country’s offshore industry -- with investments seen rising this year -- and allowed the government to start putting money back into the wealth fund for the first time since late 2015.
For many borrowers, it will be the first time the benchmark rate goes up. The increase could mean higher mortgage costs since most Norwegian loans are tied to the three-month interbank lending rate, testing the housing market which has been recovering after stricter lending regulations caused a dip in 2017.
“Uncertainty surrounding the effects of higher interest rates suggests a cautious approach to interest rate setting,” the bank said.

Gross domestic product gained 1 percent from the first quarter, when it rose 0.5 percent, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. From a year earlier, the economy expanded 2.8 percent, accelerated from 2.6 percent in the previous three-month period. Economists expected a 0.8 percent expansion in the quarter, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
While growth exceeded the Reserve Bank’s 0.5 percent forecast, the central bank may remain cautious about the economic outlook amid a slump in business confidence that could damp activity in the medium term. The RBNZ has said it is focused on the current quarter, when it wants to see evidence that fiscal stimulus is boosting growth.

Housing starts rose 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.282 million units in August, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters has expected an annual rate of 1.235 million units.
The Commerce Department raised its estimate for starts in July to a 1.174 million-unit rate.
U.S. housing starts data can be volatile and subject to large revisions. Much of August's gain was in the particularly volatile multi-family component, with starts on buildings with two or more units rising 29.3 percent to an annual rate of 406,000 units.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, rose a more modest 1.9 percent to a rate of 876,000 units in August.
Groundbreaking activity increased in the Midwest, South and West, but was flat in the Northeast.
Building permits, however, fell 5.7 percent to a rate of 1.229 million units.
The U.S. housing market has underperformed a robust economy, with economists blaming the slowdown on low inventories and rising mortgage rates, which have combined with higher house prices to make home purchasing unaffordable for some first-time buyers.

The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, narrowed by $20.3 billion to $101.5 billion, or 2.0 percent of national economic output, in the April-June period.
The current account deficit amounted to the smallest share of national output since the third quarter of 2014.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to narrow to $103.5 billion.
The Commerce Department said a tax overhaul passed by Congress in December 2017, which changed how repatriated earnings are taxed, led many companies to bring back cash parked abroad.
Companies paid out dividends and other withdrawals of $169.5 billion from foreign receipts during the second quarter, the department said, which far outstripped the amount of this cash which was reinvested.

Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.1% last month, compared to forecasts for 1.8% and the 1.9% pace seen in July.
Excluding this reading and the slight uptick seen in July, inflation in the UK has been steadily declining since it hit 3.1% last November.
The Bank of England held interest rates steady last week and emphasized its expectations for inflation to slow “sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon”.
However, the UK central bank was adamant that its “projections were conditioned on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdom’s eventual trading relationship with the European Union. “
Brexit talks are set to intensify over the coming week, with the first of three summits that European Union leaders hope will settle an agreement for departing Britain within the next two months.
EU officials will get an update on negotiations in Austria on Thursday and also decide whether to hold a special summit on Brexit in November, now that they no longer expect to clinch a deal at their regular gathering scheduled for October 18-19.
The timing of the meetings tallies with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's suggestion that an exit deal could be struck in six to eight weeks if negotiators are realistic in their demands.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export growth accelerated in August from the previous month supported by stronger shipments to the United States, a sign the escalating trade friction between the Washington and Beijing has yet to hit Japanese trade. 
But the rise in exports to the United States could put Tokyo under pressure from President Donald Trump ahead of bilateral trade talks expected later this month, some analysts say.
Japanese policymakers also worry over of the impact on the country's exports as the United States and China dive deeper into a trade war. 
Beijing added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for Trump's planned levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
There are few signs of material damage so far.
Japanese exports rose 6.6 percent in August from a year earlier, handily beating a 5.6 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll and exceeding a 3.9 percent gain in July, finance ministry data showed on Wednesday.
Japan's exports to the United States rose 5.3 percent in the year to August, the first gain in three months, led by medicines, construction and mining machinery.
U.S.-bound car exports fell for a third straight month, pulling back from last year's brisk shipments.
However, the trade data also showed imports from the United States surged 21.5 percent in August, led by aircraft and liquefied natural gas, cutting Japan's trade surplus with the United States by 14.5 percent year-on-year to 455.8 billion yen ($4.06 billion).
""Overall, the U.S.-China trade war would have a negative impact on Japan's exports and the economy,"" said Koya Miyamae, an economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""But the impact isn't apparent in the August trade data... Any effect could come out from September onwards.""
Some analysts were less optimistic.
Capital Economics said it expected seasonally adjusted data out later on Wednesday to show Japan's import volumes also exceeded export volumes in August.
""This would mark the second consecutive month that growth in exports fell short of imports and supports our view that net exports remained a drag on GDP growth in Q3,"" it said in a note.
The data comes as the Bank of Japan debates at a policy review ending on Wednesday how trade frictions could undermine growth in the export-reliant economy. 
The trade data showed exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 12.1 percent in the year to August.
Japan is hoping to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a bilateral free trade agreement at a second round of trade talks with the United States, likely to take place later this month.
Japan fears a bilateral deal could put it under pressure to open politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture.
Japan's biggest automakers and components suppliers also worry they would be hit hard if Washington follows through on proposals to hike tariffs on autos and auto parts to 25 percent.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, rose 6.8 percent.
Overall imports rose 15.4 percent in the year to August, roughly in line with the median estimate for a 14.9 percent annual increase.
The trade balance was deficit of 444.6 billion yen, largely matching the median estimate for a shortfall of 468.7 billion yen.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's average land prices rose for the first time in 27 years in the year to July 1 as an influx of foreign tourists boosted demand for hotel properties and shops, a government survey showed on Tuesday.
Commercial land prices rose for a second straight year while the pace of decline in residential land prices slowed for a ninth consecutive year, the land ministry's annual survey found.
Land prices are a key indicator to gauge how much Japan asset prices have recovered after decades of deflation.
""Land prices are recovering steadily and gradually,"" a ministry official said. 
He said that recovery in wages and employment as well as low interest rates aided the recovery.
The survey found that nationwide average land prices grew 0.1 percent in the year to July 1, the first increase since 1991, when a real estate bubble burst.
Commercial land prices rose 1.1 percent, after a 0.5 percent increase in the previous year, led by a tourism boom and redevelopment of urban areas. Strong corporate earnings increased demand for offices, the survey found.
Residential land prices slipped 0.3 percent, it showed, compared with the previous year's 0.6 percent decline.
Industrial land prices rose 0.5 percent, also the first increase in 27 years, on demand for large-scale logistics facilities.
Average land prices in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya rose 4.2 percent, accelerating from 3.5 percent the prior year, it showed. 
The government has a goal of 40 million foreign visitors by 2020, when Japan hosts the Summer Olympic Games. The number rose 19.3 percent to a record 28.7 million in 2017. 
Among commercial sites, land prices in the town of Kutchan, a part of the popular Niseko ski resort on the northern island of Hokkaido, rose the most, jumping 45.2 percent to 45,000 yen ($402.61) per square meter. Demand for accommodation and resort facilities spurred the rise, the survey found. 
Land prices of another Kutchan site had the biggest gain among all residential areas, surging 33.3 percent to 36,000 yen per square meter.
Tokyo's Ginza luxury shopping district remained the most expensive location, with 41.9 million yen per square meter, up 7.7 percent from a year earlier.

The ministry surveyed about 21,600 locations nationwide. The survey is used as a standard for land transactions, together with another ministry one published in March.

Eurostat also confirmed that inflation excluding volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, which the European Central Bank looks closely at in policy decisions, was 1.2 percent on the year.
Month-on-month, headline inflation was 0.2 percent, Eurostat said, while the figure excluding energy and food was 0.1 percent.
The data confirmed market expectations of a slight slowdown of headline inflation from 2.1 percent in July and were in line with Eurostat's previous estimates released on Aug. 31.
Inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, which many economists look at, was 1.0 percent on the year and 0.2 percent on the month.
Energy prices were up 9.2 percent year-on-year compared with a 9.5 percent rise in July.
Last week, the European Central Bank kept policy unchanged as expected, staying on track to end bond purchases this year and raise interest rates next autumn, as inflation is rebounding from lower rates at the beginning of the year.

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said the CPI rose 2.0% in August from the same month a year earlier, matching consensus.
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose by an annual rate of 1.0%, also in line with forecasts.
The ECB targets a headline inflation rate of close to, but just below 2%.
At its last policy meeting earlier this month, the ECB left interest rates on hold and confirmed plans to wind up its massive bond purchasing stimulus program by December.
ECB President Mario Draghi reiterated that the bank needs to be “patient, persistent and prudent” in its policy to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained adjustment path and indicated that interest rates would likely remain at present levels “at least through the summer of 2019”."

In contrast to business surveys -- which often show worries about how Britain's government will handle European Union withdrawal next March -- household expectations for the year to come were the second-strongest since August 2016.
Overall, the IHS Markit Household Finance Index held unchanged at 45.9 in September, the strongest reading since a series high of 46.2 recorded in January 2015.
""UK households' assessment of their current and future finances, despite ongoing Brexit uncertainty and sustained inflationary pressures, were relatively buoyant in September,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
Separate figures from Visa (NYSE:V), released slightly earlier on Monday, showed modest year-on-year growth in the volume of consumer spending for August, as Britons continued to make the most of an unusually warm summer.
The IHS Markit data did show some increased worries about employment prospects, unlike the picture painted by official data which records the lowest level of unemployment since 1975 and a record number of job vacancies.
Hayes said this was concentrated in manufacturing and was ""likely reflective of the current ambiguity towards future customs arrangements with the EU"".
There is, so far, no full exit agreement between Brussels and London and some rebels in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one.
The IHS Markit survey showed 49 percent of people expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next six months -- up by 5 percentage points on the month -- and 73 percent expect an increase within a year.
The BoE last raised rates in August, for only the second time since the global financial crisis, and most economists polled by Reuters do not expect rates to go up until after Brexit.

The IHS Markit data was based on a survey of 1,500 adults conducted by market research company Ipsos MORI between Sept. 6 and Sept. 10.

Inflation-adjusted consumer spending between June and August was 0.3 percent higher than in the three months before, up from growth of 0.2 percent in the May-July period, Visa said, based on its credit and debit card usage data.
Visa's report follows official figures last week that showed Britain's economy grew at its fastest in nearly a year in the three months to July thanks to strong consumer spending, lifted by the World Cup and unusually warm weather.
""The prolonged good weather has seen sustained performance for hotels, restaurants and bars, and 'food and drink' again topping the sector categories,"" Visa chief commercial officer Mark Antipof said.
Compared with a year ago, Visa's measure of consumer spending stood 0.4 percent higher in August, following a 0.9 percent annual drop in July.
Still, the outlook remains clouded by uncertainty about the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union -- due in just over six months -- as well as rising protectionism that could cause world trade to slow.
For those reasons the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) on Monday chopped its economic growth forecast for Britain in 2018 to 1.1 percent from its previous prediction of 1.3 percent, which had been in line with the current Reuters poll consensus of economists. [ECILT/GB]
If growth is as weak as the BCC expects, it would be Britain's worst annual performance since the 2008-09 recession caused by the global financial crisis.
The BCC trimmed its forecast for growth in 2019 to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent.

""The changes to our forecast indicate that the UK economy is in for a testing period, with persistent uncertainty and the possibility of a disorderly EU exit increasingly weighing on the UK's growth prospects,"" BCC economist Suren Thiru said.

While solid growth in the sector could cushion the impact of a vigorous multi-year government crackdown on debt and escalating trade tensions with the United States, it could also stoke fears of a bubble.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 1.4 percent in August from a month earlier, higher than July's reading of 1.1 percent, Reuters calculated from an official survey published on Saturday.
That marks the fastest gain since September 2016, and the 40th straight month of price increases, Reuters calculations show, despite tougher curbs designed to rein in a near-three-year real estate boom that has spilled over from megacities to the hinterland.
In a sign of broadening market strength, 67 out of the 70 cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported a monthly price increase for new homes, up from 65 in July. Only one city - Xiamen in the south - had an actual price decline.
Compared with a year ago, new home prices climbed 7 percent, speeding up from July's 5.8 percent rise, the NBS data showed.
""Property price gains this year are due to looser credit and the delayed effect of strong government stimulus introduced in previous months to reduce inventories, which will slowly kick in,"" said Nie Wen, an analyst at Hwabao Trust.
Chinese policymakers have rolled out a flurry of measures to support growth this year, including cutting the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves several times to boost lending to smaller businesses. 
SMALLER CITIES, BIGGER GROWTH
August price growth in the 35 small cities that the official survey tracks was more robust than in larger cities, rising 2 percent from a month ago, the NBS said in a statement accompanying the data. 
The top price performer in August was Wuxi, a third-tier city near Shanghai in eastern China, whose prices surged 3.4 percent month-on-month, NBS data showed.
That comes even as many less-regulated smaller cities are expected to gradually tighten policies to curb prices. 
China's four biggest cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou - posted an average monthly price gain of 0.3 percent, compared with an increase of 0.2 percent in July.
While many property analysts believe authorities will be more cautious about stimulating property investment than in past downturns, some suspect additional funds will inevitably flow into the market as investors look for opportunities.
Central bank data this week showed household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 701.2 billion yuan ($102 billion) in August from 634.4 billion yuan in July, accounting for 54.8 percent of total new loans in August.
China's real estate investment moderated in August on slower construction and home sales.
A recent Reuters poll showed that sentiment on China's property market has become more bullish as analysts expected home prices to rise 5 percent this year, faster than previously thought.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales recorded their smallest gain in six months in August as consumers cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and clothing, but upward revisions to July data kept intact expectations of strong economic growth in the third quarter. 
Other data on Friday showed the biggest drop in import prices in more than 1-1/2 years in August amid a decline in the cost of fuels and a range of other goods. The weak import price data came on the heels of soft inflation readings in August.
Signs of cooling consumer spending and inflation did not change views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month. The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year. 
""The seas are calm for the economy with enough wind in the sails to keep the expansion on track and not enough inflation pressures out there to halt the economy's forward progress,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month, the smallest rise since February. Data for July was revised higher to show sales rising 0.7 percent instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0.4 percent in August. Retail sales in August advanced 6.6 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales nudged up 0.1 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.8 percent jump in July. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Core retail sales were previously reported to have increased 0.5 percent in July. Despite the slowdown in core retail sales in August, consumer spending remains supported by a tightening labor market, which is steadily pushing up wages.
Annual wage growth increased at its fastest pace in more than nine years in August and there were a record 6.9 million job openings in July. Spending is also being underpinned by tax cuts and higher savings as well as high consumer sentiment. 
""Consumer spending will continue to increase at a sturdy pace through the rest of this year and into 2019, supporting overall economic growth,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data. U.S. Treasury prices fell, lifting the yield on the benchmark 10-year note back above 3 percent. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly lower. 
WEAK AUTO SALES
The economy is poised for strong growth in the third quarter and this year, but an escalating trade war between the United States and China is casting a shadow on the long-term outlook.
President Donald Trump last week threatened duties on another $267 billion worth of Chinese goods on top of a $200 billion tariff list that is awaiting his decision. Washington already has slapped duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, provoking retaliation from Beijing. 
The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the April-June period, the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace set in the first quarter. 
Growth estimates for the third quarter top a 3.0 percent rate, but Hurricane Florence, which crashed into the Carolinas on Friday, could put a dent into output. The hurricane could negatively impact labor market, housing, retail sales and industrial production data for September.
For now, the predictions for solid third-quarter economic growth prevail. A report from the Fed on Friday showed industrial production increased 0.4 percent in August after a similar gain in July. Industrial production was powered by an acceleration in the output of motor vehicles, utilities and mining. 
""Trade tensions are the biggest risk,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""If tariffs rise globally, it will push up consumer prices, undermine job and therefore income growth, and hurt financial markets.""
Auto sales fell 0.8 percent in August after slipping 0.1 percent in July. Receipts at service stations surged 1.7 percent, likely reflecting higher gasoline prices.
Sales at clothing stores fell 1.7 percent, the biggest drop since February 2017, after accelerating 2.2 percent in July. The plunge in clothing store receipts likely reflects a sharp drop in apparel prices in August, which was the biggest since 1949.
Sales at furniture stores fell 0.3 percent and receipts at building material stores were unchanged last month. 
But there were increases in online and mail-order retail sales and Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores rose after declining for several months.
In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said import prices fell 0.6 percent in August, the largest decline since January 2016, after slipping 0.1 percent in July. 
The drop in import prices likely reflects the strong dollar, which has gained more than 6 percent this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners. 
In the 12 months through August, import prices rose 3.7 percent, slowing after surging 4.9 percent in July.
""This signals a slightly smaller inflationary impact from abroad on domestic prices going forward,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Reports this week showed producer prices dropping in August for the first time in 1-1/2 years and consumer prices rising marginally.

The Commerce Department said on Friday business inventories increased 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in June.
July's increase in inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product, was in line with economists' forecasts.
Retail inventories increased 0.5 percent in July instead of rising 0.4 percent as reported in an advance estimate published last month. Retail inventories slipped 0.1 percent in June.
Motor vehicle inventories jumped 1.2 percent in July rather than 1.0 percent as reported last month. Auto inventories dipped 0.1 percent in June. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, gained 0.1 percent in July as estimated last month. They fell 0.1 percent in June.

There was an outright inventory liquidation in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted nearly a full percentage point from GDP in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace set in the January-March period.
Given strong domestic demand, businesses are likely to boost stocks of goods, which should underpin production at factories. Economists expect inventory accumulation to significantly contribute to GDP growth in the third quarter.
Business sales rose 0.2 percent in July after increasing 0.3 percent in June. At July's sales pace, it would take 1.34 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.33 months in June.

The preliminary publication of the data for August from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment increased to 100.8 from 96.2 a month earlier.
That was the second highest level since 2004, only behind the March 2018 reading of 101.4.
Analysts had forecast a rise to 96.7.
The current conditions indicator rose to 116.1 in September, from the previous 110.3.
Additionally, consumer expectations improved to 91.1 from the prior 87.1.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months decreased to 2.8% from 3.0%, while the five-year gauge fell to 2.4% from the previous 2.6%.
The surveyor’s chief economist Richard Curtin indicated that the gains were widespread across all major socioeconomic subgroups and noted that expectations hit their highest level since July 2004, largely due to more favorable prospects for jobs and incomes.
“Consumers anticipated continued growth in the economy that would produce more jobs and an even lower unemployment rate during the year ahead,” Curtin said.
This economist highlighted, however, that the largest problem cited on the economic horizon involved the anticipated negative impact from tariffs.
“Concerns about the negative impact of tariffs on the domestic economy were spontaneously mentioned by nearly one-third of all consumers in the past three months, up from one-in-five in the prior four months,” he explained."

LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging market investors are trying to gauge whether a currency crisis and the steep interest rate hikes being used to fight it could turn into a broader slowdown and even recession.
On Thursday, Turkey's central bank attempted to draw a line under a lira collapse of almost 40 percent this year by hiking interest rates more than 6 percentage points to 24 percent.
Argentina is struggling to shore up its peso, which has more than halved in value despite punitive interest rate rises to 60 percent.
Other currencies have been caught in the slipstream, with India's rupee plumbing record lows and South Africa's rand, Russia's rouble and Brazil's real losing 15-20 percent this year so far.
(For a graphic showing the losses, click: https://reut.rs/2p8rvKO)
Signs are appearing that months of market turmoil are starting to take the toll on real economies. South Africa unexpectedly entered recession in the second quarter of this year, Argentina is predicted to follow suit and Turkey is now widely forecast to experience a hard landing over the next year. (For a graphic showing GDP growth rates, click: https://reut.rs/2p88uZ4)
So what is growth like in these countries right now, what signs are there of a shock to business and consumer confidence and has the near sudden stop in investment flows seen 2019 economic forecasts deteriorate markedly?
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE
Purchasing manager indexes have suffered sharp drops across many developing nations, according to data earlier in the month. 
""When you have an environment where (the) U.S. dollar is strengthening and U.S. front-end rates are going up that tightens external financial conditions for emerging markets, especially for the deficit economies,"" said Murat Ulgen, global head of emerging markets research at HSBC.
DOMESTIC FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
Meanwhile faced with capital outflows, many emerging market policy makers have opted to hike rates, thereby also tightening domestic financial conditions, Ulgen added.
""Given that markets have been volatile, generally speaking, and rates have been higher and equity markets have been lower in summer months ... it is highly likely that financial conditions are still staying in the negative territory,"" he said.
Having tumbled some 22 percent from their January peaks, emerging equity markets are in territory commonly regarded as a bear market, is often considered to be self-sustaining decline.
""Tighter financial conditions are going to weigh on economic activity going forward,"" predicted Ulgen.
HISTORY OF SUDDEN STOPS
Emerging markets are familiar with such crises. 
The Institute of International Finance found nine episodes since 1980 where when real exchange rates fell 30 percent or more, the devaluation was sustained for at least three years and the decline did not reverse a previous overvaluation.
Mexico suffered such a fate in 1995, Indonesia and Russia in 1998 and Brazil a year later. Meanwhile Argentina and Uruguay recorded such declines in 2002, Egypt in 2003 and 2016 and Ukraine in 2014.
""There are only 9 episodes historically where the real exchange rate has fallen as much and as permanently,"" Robin Brooks, chief economist at the IIF wrote in a recent paper. 
""Real GDP falls sharply in the year of devaluation, followed by a relatively rapid recovery. The current account shifts from sizeable deficit to surplus in the wake of devaluation, powered initially by import compression and – over time – rising export volumes.""
IMPROVING TERMS OF TRADE AT A COST
A weaker currency helps close balance of payments gaps by boosting export competitiveness but also by pinching domestic purchasing power while tighter credit saps demand and growth. 
What's more, analysts are also closely assessing the impact of a growing number of trade conflicts and tariffs on emerging economies, which have seen trade become an increasingly important factors in generating economic activity. 
Ulgen, who has already chopped his economic outlook for Turkey, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, predicts the growth differential of emerging versus developed market growth will shrink in the near-term. 
SUDDEN STOP
Meanwhile capital flows will play a key role in how the most vulnerable economies will weather the latest crisis. 
Last year saw healthy flows into emerging markets, according to HSBC, which estimates that in 2017 bond markets saw inflows of $70 billion dollars while equity flows were $65 billion. 
Following a healthy start to 2018, emerging bond markets have suffered a full reversal of flows; equity markets have seen just under half of the $55 billion that had come in until the end of May leave again, HSBC found. 
Luis Organes at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) warned that a ""sudden stop"" or abrupt reduction in capital flows into emerging markets and associated negative feedback loops should bring an extended period of adjustment for countries running a large current account deficit. 
""Despite recent EM growth downgrades, activity data continue to point to downside risks to our GDP forecasts,"" he wrote in a recent note to clients. 
""This could be the start of the next phase of a more prolonged downturn for EM assets given negative feedback loops from EM growth downgrades to financial markets, EM positioning levels which have not lightened meaningfully, and a more enduring contagion from Turkey and Argentina.""

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",U.S. auto sector output boosts industrial production,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production rose in August, as strong output in auto manufacturing offset lackluster production in the rest of the factory sector.
The Federal Reserve said on Friday industrial production rose 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent increase in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production rising 0.3 percent last month after a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in July.
Manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent last month, powered by a 4.0 percent rise in motor vehicles and parts. U.S. producers assembled cars and trucks in August at an annual rate of 11.54 million units, the fastest pace since April.
But excluding motor vehicles and parts, U.S. manufacturing production was unchanged, the Fed said. Production fell for computers and electronic products as well as for electrical equipment and appliances.
The data could raise questions over how well U.S. factories are weathering an escalation of the U.S. trade war with China. The Trump administration raised tariffs on a range of Chinese imports in July, triggering retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on U.S. exports. 
Other indicators have been more upbeat. A survey of factory managers showed activity expanded in August at its fastest pace in more than 14 years on strong demand at home and abroad, according to data released by the Institute for Supply Management earlier this month.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been supported by a strong domestic and global economy. But many economists see a risk that escalating trade tensions could undercut business investment. 
Mining production rose 0.7 percent in August. Utilities output rose 1.2 percent.
With overall industrial production rising, capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose last month to 78.1 percent from 77.9 percent.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

Excluding fuels and food, import prices fell 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in July.
The so-called core import prices advanced 1.3 percent in the 12 months through August. The monthly decline in core import prices likely reflects the strong dollar, which has gained more than six percent this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners. 
Dollar strength is expected to offset some of the anticipated increase in prices, especially if the Trump administration presses ahead with tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports. Washington has already slapped duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, provoking retaliation from Beijing.
The import price data excludes duties. In August, import prices for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials dropped 0.8 percent after falling 1.1 percent in July. The cost of imported capital goods dipped 0.1 percent.
Imported motor vehicle prices were unchanged in August for a second straight month. The cost of consumer goods excluding automobiles was also unchanged after rising 0.3 percent in July.
Prices for goods imported from China slipped 0.1 percent in August for a second straight month. Prices for Chinese imports gained 0.2 percent in the 12 months through August.
The report also showed export prices fell 0.1 percent in August after declining 0.5 percent in July. Prices for agricultural products rose 0.2 percent last month, lifted by increases in soybean, wheat and corn prices.

Export prices increased 3.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in August after rising 4.3 percent in July.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 02:15AM ET</span>",How China's plan to develop rental housing backfired,"By Yawen Chen, Shu Zhang and John Ruwitch
BEIJING/HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - When President Xi Jinping of China vowed to increase the supply of rental housing last year, millions of young Chinese expected to find homes they would finally be able to afford.
But the government's initiative has had an unintended effect: a surge of property investors into the rental market that has dramatically pushed up prices.
This summer, rents in China's major cities soared in the double-digits, forcing the people that Xi vowed to help – many of them white-collar workers or recent college graduates – to downgrade to smaller flats and relocate to less desirable neighborhoods.
Companies flush with investor funding – like Ziroom and 5I5J - have been aggressively developing hundreds of thousands of rental homes in the past year.
But the homes do not come cheap, despite the increased supply. The average rent in Beijing jumped 21.16 percent year-on-year in August, compared with 3.12 percent a year earlier, data from the China Real Estate Association (CREA) shows. Similar trends were seen in other major Chinese cities.
In 2017, Wang Zhilu, 23, rented a room in a mid-tier Beijing neighborhood for 3,000 yuan ($438.17) a month. Now, he pays 4,500 yuan for a room in a similar area. 
Soaring rents have fueled widespread public frustration as the cost of living surges in cities, outpacing salary growth for many people.
""Rent now makes up about 30 percent of my salary while my housing condition is worse,"" said Tian Enyu, a 35-year-old divorced office manager in Beijing. 
At least 19 provincial capitals have seen rents soar this summer, with Chengdu in Sichuan province posting the biggest year-on-year rise of 32.95 percent in August, according to CREA. 
AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION
Investors have been piling into the rental housing sector.
Ziroom, which is owned by Zuo Hui, chairman of the Chinese real estate broker Lianjia, raised 4 billion yuan in January from investors including Tencent Holdings, Warburg Pincus and Sequoia Capital. 
The Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC launched a 4.3 billion yuan venture with Nova Property Investment in May to acquire rental apartments in cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
Tiger Global Management, a U.S.-based global investment firm, led a $70 million financing round in June for Danke, a Beijing-based rental flat operator.
Ziroom had about half a million rooms in China and commanded a market share of 30 percent at the end of 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on an April report by Meadin.com.
Xiangyu, a rental unit owned by 5I5J, was a close second with a 27 percent share. 
About 1.66 million rooms were owned or managed by rental companies and developers at the end of last year, according to Meadin.
Ziroom and Xiangyu typically source units from property owners. They then renovate the properties and rent them out at a premium, which some experts call a ""forced upgrade"" for tenants.
""These companies are very aggressive in securing flats this year,"" said Yu Runze, who leased his two-bedroom Beijing apartment to Ziroom for 7,800 yuan a month in May after rejecting an offer from Xiangyu.
The rent that Xiangyu charges is often double the price that it pays to flat owners for their properties, said Zhang Yongjing, a former property agent with 5I5J in northern Shanxi province's capital, Taiyuan.
Reuters could not reach Ziroom for comment. 5I5J did not respond to a request for comment. 
LITTLE OVERSIGHT
While the rental giants have been accused of driving up prices, a lack of regulations means that regulators have limited power to act or enforce existing rules, according to property analysts and a government source.
In August, Beijing's housing authority ordered rental firms to stop acquiring rental listings at above market prices using funds procured from banks and other financial channels.
However, it did not take action against companies believed to be using such practices.
A housing ministry source also said the body does not have an official rent tracking system, though it is ""closely monitoring the situation"".
Some analysts also blamed the persistent shortage of rental supply for the high rents. 
Government-funded public rental homes are limited, with the overall land supply shrinking in China's biggest cities amid stricter population control.
There are 900,000 homes that are technically available for rent in Beijing, according to Hu Jinghui, a former vice president at 5I5J, but Chinese home owners prefer to let them sit empty and wait for the value of their investments to rise over time.
The government does not publish an official home vacancy rate. 
The housing ministry and the statistics bureau did not respond to requests for comment. 
RARE BANKRUPTCY
Rapid growth in the sector with little regulatory control has created unexpected financial risks. 
Dingjia, a Hangzhou-based rental company, went belly-up in August due to what its chief executive called an aggressive market expansion, marking the first high-profile bankruptcy in the sector.
To ensure a pipeline of properties, Dingjia often paid home owners more than the eventual rental price. A tenant surnamed Lu told Reuters she rented from Dingjia this year for 4,700 yuan per month, but Dingjia paid the apartment owner 5,600 yuan.
Repeated phone calls to Dingjia went unanswered.
Lu was asked by Dingjia to sign a year-long consumer loan contract with a Chinese loan platform, Aishangjie, to pay her rent.
After Dingjia went under, Lu was stuck with the remaining debt payments of 23,500 yuan as her landlord stopped receiving rental payments.
It is unclear whether the government will act on the rental market given Xi's vows to develop the sector.
A source at one of China's big-four banks, who requested anonymity, said the bank had not received any guidance to tighten financing to the sector.
Sources close to the government, who also requested anonymity, told Reuters that they were unaware of any major change in policy despite the rising risks.

""The market is neither balanced nor transparent,"" said a source at the Ministry of Land and Resources. But ""if Xi doesn't say something needs to be done, these ministries won't do anything.""

EAST STROUDSBURG, Pa., 2018 (Reuters) - School bus driver Michael Payne was renting an apartment on the 30th floor of a New York City high-rise, where the landlord's idea of fixing broken windows was to cover them with boards.
So when Payne and his wife Gail saw ads in the tabloids for brand-new houses in the Pennsylvania mountains for under $200,000, they saw an escape. The middle-aged couple took out a mortgage on a $168,000, four-bedroom home in a gated community with swimming pools, tennis courts and a clubhouse. 
“It was going for the American Dream,” Payne, now 61, said recently as he sat in his living room. “We felt rich.”
Today the powder-blue split-level is worth less than half of what they paid for it 12 years ago at the peak of the nation’s housing bubble.
Located about 80 miles northwest of New York City in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, their home resides in one of the sickest real estate markets in the United States, according to a Reuters analysis of data provided by a leading realty tracking firm. More than one-quarter of homeowners in Monroe County are deeply “underwater,” meaning they still owe more to their lenders than their houses are worth.
The world has moved on from the global financial crisis. Hard-hit areas such as Las Vegas and the Rust Belt cities of Pittsburgh and Cleveland have seen their fortunes improve.
But the Paynes and about 5.1 million other U.S. homeowners are still living with the fallout from the real estate bust that triggered the epic downturn.
As of June 30, nearly one in 10 American homes with mortgages were “seriously” underwater, according to Irvine, California-based ATTOM Data Solutions, meaning that their market values were at least 25 percent lower than the balance remaining on their mortgages.
It is an improvement from 2012, when average prices hit bottom and properties with severe negative equity topped out at 29 percent, or 12.8 million homes. Still, it is double the rate considered healthy by real estate analysts.
""These are the housing markets that the recovery forgot,"" said Daren Blomquist, a senior vice president at ATTOM.
Lingering pain from the crash is deep. But it has fallen disproportionately on commuter towns and distant exurbs in the eastern half of the United States, a Reuters analysis of county real estate data shows. Among the hardest hit are bedroom communities in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions, where income and job growth have been weaker than the national norm.
(See a list of the Top 10 underwater U.S. counties and Reuters' methodology at https://tmsnrt.rs/2CMQEnX).
Developments in outlying communities typically suffer in downturns. But a comeback has been harder this time around, analysts say, because the home-price run-ups were so extreme, and the economies of many of these Midwestern and Eastern metro areas have lagged those of more vibrant areas of the country.
“The markets that came roaring back are the coastal markets,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. He said land restrictions and sales to international buyers have helped buoy demand in those areas. “In the middle of the country, you have more flat-lined economies. There’s no supply constraints. All of these things have weighed on prices.”
In addition to exurbs, military communities showed high concentrations of underwater homes, the Reuters analysis showed. Five of the Top 10 underwater counties are near military bases and boast large populations of active-duty soldiers and veterans.
Many of these families obtained financing through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA makes it easy for service members to qualify for mortgages, but goes to great lengths to prevent defaults. It is a big reason many military borrowers have held on to their negative-equity homes even as millions of civilians walked away.
A poor credit history can threaten a soldier's security clearance. And those who default risk never getting another VA loan, said Jackie Haliburton, a Veterans Service Officer in Hoke County, North Carolina, home to part of the giant Fort Bragg military installation and one of the most underwater counties in the country.
“You will keep paying, no matter what, because you want to make sure you can hang on to that benefit,” Haliburton said.
These and other casualties of the real estate meltdown are easy to overlook as homes in much of the country are again fetching record prices.
But in Underwater America, homeowners face painful choices. To sell at current prices would mean accepting huge losses and laying out cash to pay off mortgage debt. Leasing these properties often won’t cover the owners’ monthly costs. Those who default will trash their credit scores for years to come.
DREAMS DEFERRED
Special education teacher Gail Payne noses her Toyota Rav 4 out of the driveway most workdays by 5 a.m. for the two-hour ride to her job in New York City's Bronx borough.
“I hate the commute, I really, really do,"" Payne said. ""I’m tired.”
Now 66, she and husband Michael were counting on equity from the sale of their house to fund their retirement in Florida. For now, that remains a dream.
The Paynes’ gated community of Penn Estates, in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, is among scores that sprang up in Monroe County during the housing boom.
Prices looked appealing to city dwellers suffering from urban sticker shock. But newcomers didn’t grasp how irrational things had become: At the peak, prices on some homes ballooned by more than 25 percent within months.
Today, homes that once fetched north of $300,000 now sell for as little as $72,000. But even at those prices, empty houses languish on the market. When the easy credit vanished, so did a huge pool of potential buyers.
Eight hundred miles to the west, in an unincorporated area of Boone County, Illinois, the Candlewick Lake Homeowners Association begins its monthly board meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer.
Nearly 40 percent of the 9,800 homes with mortgages in this county about 80 miles northwest of Chicago are underwater, according to the ATTOM data. Some houses that went for $225,000 during the boom are now worth about $85,000, property records show.
By early 2010, unemployment topped 18 percent after a local auto assembly plant laid off hundreds of workers. At Candlewick Lake, so many people walked away from their homes that as many as a third of its houses were vacant, said Karl Johnson, chairman of the Boone County board of supervisors. 
“It just got ugly, real ugly, and we are still battling to come back from it,” Johnson said.
While the local job market has recovered, signs of financial strain are still evident at Candlewick Lake. 
The community’s roads are beat up. The entryway, meeting center and fence could all use a facelift, residents say. The lake has become a weed-choked “mess,” “a cesspool,” according to residents who spoke out at an association meeting earlier this year. Association manager Theresa Balk says a recent chemical treatment is helping.
Annual homeowner's dues of $1,136 are being stretched to pay for all the upkeep. But those fees may be a big deterrent for many would-be buyers at Candlewick Lake, said association board member Randy Budreau.
“A gated community like this, with our rules and fees, it may be just less attractive now to the general public,” he said.

That compared to a budget deficit of $108 billion in the same month last year, the department's monthly budget statement showed.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury posting a $156.5 billion deficit in August.
The government's deficit was $152 billion when accounting for calendar adjustments. That compared to an adjusted deficit of $108 billion in the same month the prior year.
Economists generally view the corporate and individual tax cuts passed by the Trump administration late last year and an increase in government spending agreed in early February as likely to balloon the nation's deficit.
The deficit for the fiscal year, which began last October, reached $898 billion, compared to a deficit of $674 billion in the same period of fiscal 2017. On an adjusted basis, the gap of $886 billion compared with $713 billion in the previous period.

Unadjusted receipts last month totaled $219 billion, down 3 percent from August last year, while unadjusted outlays were $433 billion, a jump of 30 percent from the same month in 2017.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices rise slowly; jobless claims near 49-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August as increases in gasoline and rents were offset by declines in healthcare and apparel costs, and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing. 
Despite the moderate consumer price increases last month, inflation remains underpinned by a tightening labor market and robust economic growth. Labor market strength was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment aid dropped last week to near a 49-year low.
""With labor market conditions tight, wage growth accelerating and input prices being pushed up by capacity constraints and recently imposed tariffs, there is plenty of upward pressure on prices,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in July. In the 12 months through August, the CPI rose 2.7 percent, slowing from July's 2.9 percent advance. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent. The so-called core CPI had increased by 0.2 percent for three straight months. 
In the 12 months through August, the core CPI gained 2.2 percent after rising 2.4 percent in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 0.3 percent and the core CPI gaining 0.2 percent in August.
The inflation report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing producer prices falling in August for the first time in 1-1/2 years.
The dollar, which has gained more than 6 percent this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners, is weighing on the prices of goods such as apparel.
August's tepid consumer price gains did not change expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Sept. 25-26 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank has lifted rates twice this year.
The Fed tracks a different inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 2.0 percent in July, hitting the Fed's 2 percent target for the third time this year.
""Of course there is always significant month-to-month volatility in the subcomponents, but looking out longer-term we continue to believe that the most likely outcome is a gradual firming in consumer price inflation,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""At this point in the cycle the Fed's concerns appear to be shifting from undesirably low inflation to undesirably high inflation.""
An escalating trade war between the United States and China is expected to drive up inflation. President Donald Trump last week threatened duties on another $267 billion worth of Chinese goods on top of a $200 billion tariff list that is awaiting his decision. Washington already has slapped duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, provoking retaliation from Beijing.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's July 31–Aug. 1 meeting published last month showed ""several participants commented that increases in the prices of particular goods, such as those induced by the tariff increases, would likely be one source of short-term upward pressure on the inflation rate.""
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the inflation data and also as the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, staying on track to end bond purchases this year and raise rates next autumn.
U.S. Treasury yields dipped while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
RENTS RISING
Last month, gasoline prices rebounded 3.0 percent after dropping 0.6 percent in July. Food prices edged up 0.1 percent, matching July's rise. Food consumed at home was unchanged.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3 percent in August after advancing by the same margin in the prior month. The rent index shot up 0.4 percent. 
Healthcare costs decreased 0.2 percent for a second straight month as prices for doctor and hospital services fell. Apparel prices tumbled 1.6 percent, the biggest drop since 1949. It was the third straight monthly decline in apparel prices.
New motor vehicle prices were unchanged last month, but the cost of used cars and trucks rose for a third consecutive month. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Sept. 8, the lowest level since December 1969.
Economists had forecast claims rising to 210,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,000 last week to 208,000, also the lowest level since December 1969.
The labor market continues to strengthen, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 201,000 jobs in August and annual wage growth notching its biggest gain in more than nine years. Job openings hit an all-time high of 6.9 million in July.

The Fed's Beige Book report, which was published on Wednesday, described the labor market as ""tight throughout the country, with most districts reporting widespread shortages.""

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Cuba releases agricultural data reversing previous growth claim,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban food production declined slightly in 2017, contrary to a previous government claim it had increased 3 percent, according to final data released this week by the National Statistics Office.
Ricardo Cabrisas, at the time economy minister, reported to the National Assembly in December that agricultural production was up 3 percent, contributing to a 1.6 percent increase in gross domestic product.
The overall economic growth surprised most analysts as Cuba has struggled with a liquidity crisis since 2015 when the economy and oil industry of its main economic partner, Venezuela, imploded.
Since then all imports by Cuba have fallen around 25 percent and the government has delayed payments to some suppliers and joint venture partners, while looking beyond Venezuela for fuel.
The reported increase in food production in 2017 was unexpected in the view of analysts, as the country had been gripped by a serious drought, then devastated by Hurricane Irma in September, and subsequently hit with unseasonable rainfall. The sector is decapitalized and boasts little irrigation and drainage.
""The main agricultural production sectors report favorable results, among them: tobacco, vegetables, beans, meats, beef and pork, except egg and fresh milk production, which decreased mainly due to the impact of the drought and Hurricane Irma,"" Cabrisas said in his speech to the Cuban parliament.
However, according to this week’s report, output of roots, vegetables, grains and fruit fell to 7.1 million tonnes last year from 7.2 million tonnes in 2016 (https:// Livestock and milk production were also down, while that of eggs was up slightly. Communist-run Cuba imports between 60 percent and 70 percent of the food it consumes at a cost of around $2 billion, mainly bulk cereals and grains such as rice, corn, soy and beans, as well as items such as powdered milk and chicken. Domestic output in all those categories declined last year, according to the report. Agricultural production, which has stagnated for a decade, was hit hard earlier this year by heavy rains in the growing season even while still recovering from Hurricane Irma. No data has been published on the sector for 2018.  
The state owns 80 percent of the land and leases most of that to farmers and cooperatives. The remainder is owned by private farmers and cooperatives.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Sept. 8, the lowest level since December 1969, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 210,000 in the latest week. The claims data covered last Monday's Labor Day holiday. Claims tend to be volatile around public holidays.
The Labor Department said only claims for Maine were estimated last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,000 last week to 208,000, also the lowest level since December 1969. 
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. It continues to strengthen, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 201,000 jobs in August and annual wage growth notching its biggest gain in more than nine years. Job openings hit an all-time high of 6.9 million in July.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report, which was published on Wednesday, described the labor market as ""tight throughout the country, with most districts reporting widespread shortages.""
Though there have been reports of some companies either planning job cuts or laying off workers because of trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, they have been partially offset by increased hiring in the steel industry.
Economists, however, warn of widespread job losses if the Trump administration presses ahead with tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports. President Donald Trump last week threatened duties on another $267 billion worth of Chinese goods on top of a $200 billion tariff list that is awaiting his decision.
Washington has already slapped duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, provoking retaliation from Beijing. The United States has also engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs with other trade partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 15,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Sept. 1, the lowest level since December 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims decreased 8,250 to 1.71 million, the lowest level since November 1973.

1052,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. Core Inflation Unexpectedly Cools on Apparel, Medical Costs","(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of underlying U.S. inflation unexpectedly cooled in August as apparel prices fell by the most in about seven decades and medical-care costs declined, offering Americans a respite from accelerating price gains.
Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the core consumer price index rose 2.2 percent in August from a year earlier, compared with the 2.4 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, a Labor Department report showed Thursday. The broader CPI slowed to a 2.7 percent annual gain from 2.9 percent.
The cooling of price gains, along with what last week’s jobs report showed was the fastest wage increase since 2009, meant inflation-adjusted hourly pay rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, following a 0.1 percent decline in August.
The moderation in the core gauge partly reflects a 1.6 percent monthly drop in apparel prices, a component that tends to be volatile. Even so, the broader slowdown follows data showing a surprise drop in producer prices and suggests the path of inflation could be softer than expected. At the same time, freight prices and rising wages, along with tariffs and counter- levies, may keep putting upward pressure on inflation.
Federal Reserve policy makers are widely expected to raise interest rates later this month, though a more persistent slowdown in inflation could affect their outlook for future increases.
Monthly Change
The core CPI rose 0.1 percent from the prior month, compared with the median estimate of economists for a 0.2 percent gain, and followed an annual increase of 2.4 percent in July. The broader CPI was up 0.2 percent, less than forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase. It was expected to rise 2.8 percent from a year earlier.
Besides apparel, the index for medical care fell 0.2 percent for a second month. The shelter category, which accounts for about one-third of the CPI, showed a 0.3 percent gain, in line with recent increases. Prices of new automobiles were unchanged, the first month without a gain since April, while used cars and trucks rose 0.4 percent.
Airfares rose 2.4 percent following a 2.7 percent advance in July, amid higher fuel prices, one of the biggest costs for airlines.
The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation -- a separate consumption-based figure from the Commerce Department -- came in above the central bank’s 2 percent goal in July, and the figure tends to run slightly below the Labor Department’s CPI. August numbers are due on Sept. 28, after the Fed’s two-day meeting.
Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices increased 3 percent in August from the prior month, the most since April, and were up 20.3 percent over the past 12 months.

The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to hold rates steady at 0.75%.
""Any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,"" the bank said in its policy summary.
The UK monetary authority decided to lift rates to that level in August, its highest point since March 2009, because it felt the economy had recovered from its slowdown at the start of the year and noted that, despite still-slow growth in the UK economy, inflation was rising at a faster pace than its targeted rate.
The annual rate of inflation is currently running at 2.5%, slightly above the BoE’s target of 2% after falling back from its peak of 3.1% in November.Brexit negotiations remain significant risk
Thursday’s decision to hold steady comes at a time of growing concerns over a lack of clarity on the terms under which the UK will exit the EU in March next year.
“The MPC continues to recognize that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal,” the BoE said in the minutes.
“Since the Committee’s previous meeting, there have been indications, most prominently in financial markets, of greater uncertainty about future developments in the withdrawal process,” it added.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 04:41AM ET</span>",Holes in Swiss property market ring mortgage alarm bells,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Rupert Pretterklieber
ZURICH (Reuters) - Nearly four years after a 1930s telephone switchboard center was transformed into 18 industrial-style loft apartments in Zurich's Wiedikon neighborhood it is still not fully occupied.
With rent plus utility bills of just over 5,400 Swiss francs per month for a three-bedroom apartment, the development by part of Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is indicative of a real estate rush which is raising regulatory red flags.
A search for yield driven by Switzerland's negative interest rates has driven investors to build up their residential property portfolios and commission new luxury complexes.
But although the country's vacancy rates have hit their highest levels in more than two decades, Swiss banks have upped mortgage lending as more investors seek to cash in.
This is causing alarm among Swiss authorities who warn banks could be exposed when interest rates rise from the abnormally low levels used by the central bank to rein in the Swiss franc.
""A real estate bubble is the biggest asset risk on the banking side,"" one regulatory official said. ""The investment property, buy-to-let segment is definitely overheated.""
Vacancies on rental apartments more than doubled in nine years and the Swiss National Bank in June suggested implementing ""targeted measures"" for residential investment property lending.
In an indication of the dependency on low interest rates to sustain demand, UBS (S:UBSG) says nearly one in five mortgage applicants in Switzerland is looking to rent the property out.
With rates for ten-year mortgages at below 2 percent, compared to an average of around 5 percent from 1960 to the onset of the financial crisis a decade ago, creditors and investors are exposed to the risk of not being able to refinance their loans when interest rates do rise.
But with insurers Zurich (S:ZURN),  Swiss Life  (S:SLHN) and  Axa  Winterthur, along with a number of pension funds, offering 10-year rates of 1.3 to 1.4 percent developers have pressed ahead with their building bonanza.
TENANTS IN DEMAND
The stresses are most apparent in rural areas such as Remigen in the Aargau canton, where high-end projects have failed to find tenants, developers are offering discounts and bonuses, including rent-free introductory offers.
""There are regions where I wouldn't build anymore,"" said Anton Affentranger, chief executive of Implenia (S:IMPN), Switzerland's largest construction firm, which converted the Swisscom building that Credit Suisse took on in Zurich.
""I wouldn't build out in the sticks,"" he added.
Credit Suisse's Real Estate Switzerland group, an investment vehicle for pension funds which focuses on residential properties, saw its portfolio grow by nearly 13 percent to 7 billion francs from June 2014 to June 2017.
But while its vacancy rate nearly doubled to 8.2 percent, its generated returns -- although down 11 percent over a three-year period -- remain comparably attractive at 4.59 percent.
What is worrying some property market analysts is that while rents have fallen, purchase prices have risen, posing a persistent affordability risk and bringing back memories of a late 1980s Swiss real estate bubble which triggered a damaging banking crisis in the 1990s when it burst.
It now costs the equivalent of 30.7 annual rental payments to purchase a comparable home, according to UBS's second-quarter real estate bubble index, the highest purchase-price-to-rent ratio in a 36-year survey and above the previous peak of March 1989 at almost the height of the earlier real estate bubble.
""There will have to be a price correction in the investment business. The appetite for real estate investment is so large that it's caused large distortions,"" Axa's (PA:AXAF) head of Swiss real estate, Ernst Schaufelberger, said. 
""Many private (investors) are taking on a lot of debt.""
SLEEP EASY
There are also concerns about affordability for commercial borrowers, with ratings agency Moody's saying more than half the loans granted failed banks' own self-regulation tests .
These tests assess whether a mortgage would remain affordable -- calculated as no more than a third of a borrower's gross income or a third of net rent on investment properties -- should interest rates rise to 5 percent.
""For residential investment property held by commercial borrowers, 51 percent of loans transgressed this guideline in 2017, up from 37 percent in 2016,"" Moody's said.
""A sharp fall in house prices may result in collateral values no longer covering the value of the loans, which would imply outright losses for the bank in the event of default.""
The Swiss National Bank has said new rules boosting capital requirements for domestic-focused banks of systemic importance should help cushion against any fallout, but there is growing concern that the government may also need to step in.
""All major financial crises have been precipitated by a real estate crash,"" the regulatory official said, adding the big question was how sharp the correction would be.
While many banks agree that prices have reached a high level and that certain lenders have been over-generous in granting loans, they see the worries as overblown.
Switzerland's third-largest bank, cooperative lender Raiffeisen [RFSHW.UL], is the country's biggest mortgage lender and issues nearly one in four Swiss mortgages.

""I'm of the opinion that one can more or less close one's eyes and sleep easily,"" Raiffeisen Chief Economist Martin Neff said. ""There are one or two cases that require targeted action, but I don't see a need for a broader market warning.""

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Many battleground U.S. House districts see strong 2017 income growth,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Household incomes posted strong growth last year in more than a dozen U.S. congressional districts where Republicans face stiff challenges in November elections, according to a Reuters analysis of Census Bureau data published on Thursday.
The rise in incomes could support the party's hopes of keeping Democrats from winning the 23 seats they need to seize control of the U.S. House of Representatives and thwart Republican President Donald Trump's agenda.
The party of sitting presidents tends to lose seats in U.S. congressional midterm elections and some analysts believe Trump's low national approval rating could drag on Republican candidates.
The Census data, part of the bureau's annual American Community Survey, showed that median incomes grew 6 percent or more last year in 14 battleground districts, more than a percentage point higher than the national median income gain.
All 14 of the districts are held by Republicans. The party's candidates this year have made the strengthening U.S. economy under Trump a dominant theme in their campaigns for the Nov. 6 elections.
That message was supported on Wednesday by separate data that showed the national median income last year - Trump's first in office - rose to its highest in a decade after adjusting for inflation and survey changes.
Many of the districts have large, well-educated suburban populations, a demographic that tends to express more disapproval of Trump in opinion polls.
The Census figures for congressional districts are not adjusted for inflation and are subject to statistical margins of error because they are based on surveys of small areas. The fuzziness in the data makes it difficult to assess income growth in many districts, but Reuters verified the growth in those districts was statistically significant.
In New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District, for example, median income grew 10.4 percent in 2017 to $82,301, according to Thursday's data.
The Republican incumbent, Tom MacArthur, is touting the district's improved economic fortunes, including a drop in area unemployment. The contest between MacArthur and Democratic challenger Andy Kim is widely seen as a toss-up.
Despite the growth, national wage gains have been historically weak since the 2007-2009 recession and some political scientists have predicted that lackluster earnings growth could weigh on Republicans in November.
Yet in several key congressional districts, voters are feeling the economy's strength in their pocketbooks.

The median income grew by 9.6 percent in North Carolina's Charlotte-area 9th Congressional District, also seen as a toss-up, and by 9.2 percent in California's 49th District. That district in traditionally conservative Orange County, is held by retiring Republican Darrell Issa, but the race is seen leaning to Democrats in November.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>","Japan's booming July machinery orders point to accelerating capex, growth","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders robustly exceeded expectations in July, rebounding from the previous month's decline and firming up the view that capital expenditure will continue to expand and boost overall economic growth.
The 11.0 percent rise in core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, soared over the median estimate for a 5.7 percent increase seen in a Reuters poll and was the fastest increase since January 2016.
Overseas machinery orders rose 6.0 percent month-on-month in July, recovering from a 12.0 percent decline in June, a sign that export demand will hold up in the face of growing trade friction - for now.
However, the outlook is not without risks. A Reuters tankan survey showing business confidence among Japanese manufacturers slipped in September from a seven-month high due to worries over an escalating trade war between the United States and China.
Nonetheless, economists still expect companies to invest more to cope with growing labor shortages, although businesses may hold back spending if Japan gets dragged into a trade war with the United States.
""Japanese companies' need to invest in new equipment is so strong that they are willing to do so even though trade protectionism clouds the outlook,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""This is clearly driven by labor shortages. There is room for capex to rise further and add to economic growth.""
Japan's labor pool is dwindling due to its rapidly aging population, and companies across a broad range of industries are investing more in automation and IT systems to operate with fewer staff.
The government and the Bank of Japan have long argued that increased capital expenditure will improve stodgy domestic demand, but business investment is closely tied to corporate sentiment and could gradually fade if companies become more cautious.
""We haven't seen the impact yet in the hard data, but looking ahead I am slightly worried about the impact from the trade war,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities.
""It's not just about domestic capex. Japan produces capital goods for export that can be affected.""
The Reuters tankan, published earlier on Thursday, showed the sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 26 in September, down four points from the previous month, weighed by declining confidence in areas such as electric machinery, metal products/machinery, textiles/paper and chemicals.
Business is also concerned that U.S. President Donald Trump will turn his attention to Japan, asking for specific measures from Japan to lower its trade surplus with United States - backed up by the threat of high tariffs.
Thursday's cabinet office data showed manufacturers' machinery orders rose 11.8 percent in July, rebounding from a 15.9 percent decline in the previous month, thanks to increased orders from makers of chemicals, heavy machinery and processed food.
Service-sector orders rose 10.9 percent in July, versus a 7.0 percent decline in the previous month, thanks to bigger orders from wholesalers, retailers, shipping companies, and telecommunications businesses.
Separate data this month showed a modest increase in household spending amid rising real wages, offering hope that consumer spending will also support growth.

The RICS said its monthly national house price balance edged down to +2 in August from July's six-month high of +4, in line with average expectations in a Reuters poll of economists.
London has been the hardest-hit property market in the United Kingdom since 2016's Brexit vote, with appetite for expensive city center housing damaged by concern about financial services jobs after Brexit and higher purchase taxes.
The prospect of higher interest rates was a further concern, RICS said, after the Bank of England raised rates in August for only the second time in a decade and said it was on course to raise rates gradually.
RICS said its regional price balance for London sank to -52 in August, its lowest since April, while in Northern Ireland, where prices have yet to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the index was a robust +48.
""It is clearly very difficult to talk about the housing market ... without being acutely aware of the marked differences in trends across the UK. In many parts of the country the housing market actually remains quite firm,"" RICS economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
Sales volumes at a national level were the weakest in five months, but this mostly reflected a sluggish market in regions neighboring London, with solid demand in Northern Ireland and southwest England.

In the longer term, RICS said its members expected rents to grow faster than house prices. Rents were forecast to rise by about 3 percent a year over the next five years, while prices were predicted to increase at an annual rate of 2 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers slipped in September from August's seven-month high, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, a sign the escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing is keeping exporters on edge. 
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's tankan quarterly survey, found the service sector's mood rebounding in September from a two-year low recorded in August as summer bonuses and heat waves boosted retail spending. 
Compared with three months ago, manufacturers' mood was unchanged and service-sector sentiment was slightly lower, suggesting that the BOJ tankan due on Oct. 1 is likely to show business morale holding largely steady.
The Reuters Tankan follows government data out on Monday that showed Japan's economy expanded at its fastest pace since 2016, underscoring the view that capital expenditure continues to back the economy even in the face of trade tensions and natural disasters.
The Reuters poll found manufacturers' sentiment was expected to bounce over the coming three months, while service-sector morale was seen slipping slightly.
But in the Reuters poll of 482 large- and mid-sized companies, exporters of cars and metal products/machinery complained about effects from Sino-U.S. trade tensions, with their exchanges of retaliatory tariffs affecting shipments and capital expenditure.
""Business investment is slow to expand as companies take a wait-and-see stance on capex in the face of the Sino-U.S. trade war,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey.
Some 258 firms responded in the Reuters Tankan conducted Aug. 29-Sept. 10. The survey is anonymous. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 26 in September, down four points from the previous month, weighed by declining confidence in areas such as electric machinery, metal products/machinery, textiles/paper and chemicals. 
The manufacturers' index was unchanged compared with three months ago, although it is expected to rebound to 32 in December. 
The service-sector index rose to 33 from 25 in August, led by retailers. The service-sector index was down two points from 35 in June. It is expected to slip to 32 in December. 
The BOJ's latest tankan showed big manufacturers' sentiment soured for a second straight quarter in the three months to June, hurt by rising input costs and as U.S. trade protectionism clouded the outlook for Japan's export-dependent economy.

Revised government data on Monday showed heavy capital spending helped the economy grow at an annualized 3.0 percent in April-June, handily beating economists' median estimate for a 2.6 percent gain and posting the fastest expansion since first-quarter 2016.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 03:21PM ET</span>",U.S. incomes rose but inequality widened in 2017: data,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The median U.S. household income rose for a third straight year in 2017 to the highest on record since 1967 by one measure, but the gap between white- and non-white households widened, government data showed on Wednesday.
The Census Bureau said in its Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage and Supplemental Poverty Measure report that median household incomes increased 1.8 percent to $61,400 last year.
""Without adjusting for the change in the income questions, 2017 has the highest median household income on record since 1967,"" said Jonathan Rothbaum, chief of income statistics at the Census Bureau. ""When you adjust for the change, median household income in previous years was just as high.""
But while the median household income for white, non-Hispanic households rose 2.6 percent to $68,145 in 2017 and rose 3.7 percent to $50,486 for Hispanic households, it fell 0.2 percent to $40,258 for African-American households.
The report showed that the poverty rate — the percentage of people living in poverty — fell to 12.3 percent last year from 12.7 percent in 2016. The Census Bureau also said about 28.5 million residents did not have health insurance in 2017, not statistically different from the previous year.
""While any reduction in poverty or increase in income is a step in the right direction, most families have just barely made up the ground lost over the past decade,"" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute. 
""In 2015 and 2016, income growth was stronger and broad-based, with growth for low- and middle-income households tracking overall growth. In 2017, however, well-worn patterns of inequality reemerged, with stronger growth at the top than for typical households,"" Gould added.
The Census report showed the poverty threshold in 2017 was an income of $24,858 for a family of four. 
Analysts say this number shows a trend of declining poverty that has persisted since 2014 under the tenure of former President Barack Obama.
The jump in overall income in Wednesday's report showcases the U.S. economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession that was felt by many American households in 2017, largely driven by a robust labor market. 
""The equity markets and overall industry sentiment have picked up during President Trump's tenure, but he did inherit a relatively downward trend on the unemployment and income rates, among other metrics like poverty,"" said Chris Christopher, executive director of consumer economics at IHS Markit in St. Louis, Missouri.

The economy added 2.2 million jobs in 2017, with the unemployment ending the year at 4.1 percent. The unemployment rate has since declined to a near 18-year low of 3.9 percent and the economy continued to churn out jobs.

The S&P 500 sold off slightly after the report was released, but cut losses soon after.
The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through Aug. 31, showed the U.S. economy and inflation continued on a upward trajectory, but manufacturers' plans to ramp up spending was upended by ongoing trade tensions.
""Businesses generally remained optimistic about the near-term outlook, though most Districts noted concern and uncertainty about trade tensions -- particularly though not only among manufacturers. A number of Districts noted that such concerns had prompted some businesses to scale back or postpone capital investment,"" according to the book.
The Fed's concerns over trade tensions come as both the U.S. and China have vowed to impose tariffs on each other, though a report Wednesday said the U.S. and China would restart trade negotiations, which eased investor worries somewhat.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sent a letter to Chinese officials to propose trade talks in the next few weeks, The Wall Street Journal reported.
In a sign that inflation may be heating up, the Fed said ""businesses' input costs have generally been rising more rapidly than selling prices,"" which leaves the door open for further consumer inflation growth, as businesses have made ""increased efforts"" to pass along cost hikes to customers.
""Prices of final goods and services continued to rise at a modest to moderate pace in most Districts, though there were some signs of a deceleration,"" the Fed said in the report.
The Fed's Beige Book drew a muted reaction in investor expectations for further rate hikes, as the odds of a December rate hike were unchanged at 81%, according to the Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor tool."
1063,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 11:45AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices post first drop in one-and-a-half years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in August, recording their first drop in 1-1/2 years, as declines in the prices of food and a range of trade services offset an increase in the cost of energy products.
Despite the surprise weakness in producer prices reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday, overall inflation is steadily rising, driven by a tightening labor market and robust economy.
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates later this month for the third time this year.
""Inflation pressures should intensify in coming quarters,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The unemployment rate is low, GDP growth is above trend, wage growth is accelerating ... and fiscal policy is supportive for the economy."" 
The producer price index for final demand slipped 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in July. August's fall in the PPI was the first since February 2017. That further lowered the annual increase in the PPI to 2.8 percent from 3.3 percent in July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI increasing 0.2 percent in August and advancing 3.2 percent year-on-year.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services edged up 0.1 percent last month. The so-called core PPI gained 0.3 percent in July.
In the 12 months through August, the core PPI increased 2.9 percent after rising 2.8 percent in July. 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
DECLINING MARGINS
The correlation between producer and consumer prices has weakened after the government revamped the PPI basket and changed the methodology several years ago. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 2.0 percent in July, hitting the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for the third time this year. 
Government data on Thursday is expected to show consumer prices rising 0.3 percent in August after gaining 0.2 percent in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
There has so far been no widespread price increases from the Trump administration's import tariffs on lumber, washing machines, solar panels, steel and aluminum, as well as a range of Chinese goods. 
But with the trade war between the United States and China escalating, economists believe this will change and expect the import duties to boost inflation in the coming months. Recent manufacturing surveys continue to show increases in raw material prices amid growing strains on the supply chain. 
Wholesale food prices fell 0.6 percent in August, pulled down by sharp declines in the costs of eggs and fresh fruits and melons. Food prices, which dipped 0.1 percent in July, have now decreased for three straight months.
Wholesale energy prices rose 0.4 percent in August, with gasoline prices surging 0.6 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in the prior month. Energy prices fell 0.5 percent in July.
Overall, the cost of wholesale goods was unchanged in August after edging up 0.1 percent in July. Prices for iron and steel scrap fell 5.6 percent last month, the biggest drop since October 2017. Nonferrous scrap prices decreased 8.7 percent, the largest decline since January 2009.
The cost of services slipped 0.1 percent last month, led by a 0.9 percent decline in the index for trade services, which measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services dipped 0.1 percent in July. 
Over 80 percent of the drop in the cost of services last month was attributed to margins for machines and equipment wholesaling, which fell 1.7 percent.
""Declining margins at machinery and equipment firms suggest producers may be struggling to pass on rising input costs related to recent tariffs,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The cost of healthcare services rose 0.3 percent as a 0.5 percent drop in prices for hospital outpatient care was offset by a 0.6 percent jump in the cost of doctor visits, which was the largest gain since June 2010. There were also increases in prices of hospital inpatient and dental care.

Healthcare prices ticked up 0.1 percent in July. Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Production at factories in the euro zone dropped in July for a second consecutive month and by more than expected, in what could herald a possible slowdown of the bloc's economy in the third quarter, official data released on Wednesday showed.
The fall was mostly caused by bad data from Germany, the bloc's largest economy, and Italy, which has gone through a stormy summer with market jitters over large spending plans of its new euroskeptic government. 
The European Union statistics agency Eurostat said industry output in the 19-country currency bloc fell in July by 0.8 percent during the month and by 0.1 percent year-on-year.
The numbers are a negative surprise after economists polled by Reuters had forecast a smaller 0.5 percent drop month-on-month and a 1.0 percent rise from a year earlier.
Eurostat also revised its figures for June, saying industrial production fell 0.8 percent on the month, a bigger fall than the previous estimate of 0.7 percent.
The year-on-year data for June was also revised down to a 2.3 percent rise from 2.5 percent.
Both Germany and Italy, the third biggest economy in the bloc, recorded a 1.8 percent monthly drop in their July industrial production, which was only partly offset by a 0.7 percent increase in the output of France, the bloc's second largest country.
""This should prove to be more food for thought for Italian political actors currently negotiating the content of the next budget,"" ING analyst Paolo Pizzoli said in a note.
Market tensions over Italy have eased in the last 10 days after the government said it was committed to reducing its large debt and keeping the deficit under control in its budget for next year, which will be finalised by mid-October. 
IMPACT ON GROWTH?
Although output data tend to be very volatile, industry's marked slowdown in the first month of the third quarter could be a sign of weaker economic growth. 
Eurostat will release its preliminary flash estimate of euro zone's growth in the third quarter on Oct. 30.
The data were disappointing, said Jack Allen at research firm Capital Economics. But he added that things were not as bad as the figures showed, because the drop followed an unusually strong growth in production in the second quarter.
The monthly output fall in July was mostly caused by a 1.9 percent drop in the production of durable consumer goods, such as cars or fridges, which could show managers' prediction of lower consumer appetite for larger spending.
The output of non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing, also fell more than the overall reading, by 1.3 percent on the month. 

However, in a positive sign for future investment, the output of capital goods, such as machinery, went up by 0.7 percent on the month.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.2 percent in August from 3.8 percent in July in seasonally adjusted terms as the number of unemployed rose by 134,000 people from a year earlier.
This was the labor market's worst performance since January 2010, when the economy was still reeling from the global financial crisis, when 10,000 jobs were lost. The overall number of employed people rose by just 3,000 - also the worst since January 2010. 
Each month's worsening jobs report has sparked a strong public backlash, with President Moon Jae-in’s approval rating falling below 50 percent for the first time on Sept.7.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 02:02PM ET</span>","Record U.S. job openings, quits rate boost wage growth outlook","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in July and more Americans voluntarily quit their jobs, pointing to sustained labor market strength and confidence that could soon spur faster wage growth.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released on Tuesday also suggested a further tightening in labor market conditions, with employers appearing to increasingly have trouble finding suitable workers.
While the tightening labor market could boost wage gains, some economists warned that worker shortages could over time negatively impact economic growth. The JOLTS report cemented expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Sept. 25-26 policy meeting. The Fed has raised rates twice this year.
""The economic expansion is on a collision course with a lack of workers to man the shop floors, work the restaurants and stores at the shopping malls across America,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""No workers, no growth, it's that simple.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 117,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.9 million in July. That was the highest level since the series started in December 2000. The jobs openings rate was 4.4 percent, unchanged from the previous month and an all-time high first touched in April.
The current level of job openings means there is a job for every one of the 6.2 million people who were unemployed in August. Hiring was little changed at 5.7 million in July, keeping the hiring rate at 3.8 percent for a second straight month.
There were 46,000 unfilled jobs in the finance and insurance industry in July. Nondurable goods manufacturing had 32,000 vacancies. The job opening rate in the overall manufacturing industry climbed to a record high of 3.8 percent in July from 3.6 percent in June.
But job openings in the retail trade industry fell by 85,000. There were also decreases in education and federal government job vacancies in July.
WORKER SHORTAGES
The scarcity of workers was also corroborated by a survey of small businesses published on Tuesday. The NFIB survey found that job openings at small businesses hit a 45-year high in August. A record number of businesses reported they could not find qualified workers to fill open positions. 
According to the NFIB, job openings were mostly prevalent in construction, manufacturing and wholesale trade. There was also a dearth of truck drivers.
""Looming shortages of qualified workers could prove detrimental to business expansion plans in coming months,"" Dante DeAntonio, an economist with Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""In the meantime, the increasing tightness in the labor market is spurring more workers to re-enter the workforce as well as leave their jobs in search of better opportunities.""
The worker shortages, especially for truck drivers, are already contributing to bottlenecks in the supply chain, which could slow the vibrant economy. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, almost double the 2.2 percent pace set in the January-March period. 
Growth this year is expected to top 3 percent. 
The Labor Department's JOLTS report also showed the robust labor market is giving Americans confidence to quit their jobs for other positions. The quits rate increased to 2.4 percent in July, the highest level since April 2001, from 2.3 percent in June. Fed officials look at the quits rate as a measure of job market confidence.
The increase in job mobility supports economists' optimism that job growth may be finally on a faster path. The government last week reported a surge in annual wage growth in August, with average hourly earnings increasing 2.9 percent, the largest gain since June 2009, from 2.7 percent in July.
Wage gains have largely remained moderate even as the unemployment rate has dropped to near an 18-year low of 3.9 percent.
""Workers are leveraging the tighter labor market to find new opportunities and employers are poaching workers from other firms,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at job search website Indeed in Washington. ""The next question is how more quitting will translate into higher wage growth.""

Key Takeaways
Small businesses are increasingly optimistic as the economic expansion enters its 10th year and the Trump administration prioritizes industry deregulation and tax cuts. Companies have been boosting inventories to match robust consumer demand for goods and services.
“The small business engine continues to roar with the dramatic change in economic policies since November 2016,” survey authors William Dunkelberg and Holly Wade said in the report.
While the gauge of intent to hire reached a record, finding qualified workers remains a problem. Of companies trying to fill a position in the month, 89 percent reported finding few or no qualified applicants. At the same time, reports of higher compensation were unchanged at a net 32 percent of firms and plans to raise pay decreased 1 point to a net 21 percent.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",UK pay growth beats forecasts as hiring levels off,"By David Milliken and Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - British workers' pay excluding bonuses picked up faster than expected during the three months to July to a rate that has not been beaten in three years, as businesses found it harder to hire staff, official figures showed on Tuesday.
The Bank of England has long forecast that a tighter labor market will lead to faster pay growth -- albeit not at the rates seen before the financial crisis -- and the latest data are likely to strengthen its focus on domestic inflation pressures.
Both average weekly earnings excluding bonuses -- the measure preferred by the BoE -- and total pay grew at the top end of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
Earnings excluding bonuses were 2.9 percent up on the year in the three months to July versus 2.7 percent in June, matching a peak seen in March. Pay has not risen faster since July 2015.
Total earnings growth picked up to 2.6 percent from 2.4 percent.
Sterling rallied on the news and British government bond prices fell, though analysts do not expect the central bank to signal any acceleration of its rate hike plans at this week's meeting. The meeting comes barely a month after it raised rates for only the second time since the financial crisis.
""While the Bank of England are almost certainly set to stand pat and leave rates unchanged this Thursday, there remains plenty to suggest further tightening going forward as long as there's not a large adverse Brexit-related shock,"" said David Cheetham, a market analyst at currency brokers XTB.
The faster pay growth will comfort to British consumers, whose household incomes have been squeezed by a spike in inflation after June 2016's Brexit vote. The ONS said pay had been growing faster than inflation for several months now.
The BoE keeps a close eye on wage growth for signs of inflation pressure, and last week Governor Mark Carney told legislators that pay growth had slowly risen since 2015 without much accompanying improvement in productivity growth.
That increased employers' labor costs, which were now growing at a rate that pointed to inflation at around 2 percent and required the BoE to raise interest rates at a ""limited and gradual"" pace, he said.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice in the past year, and after last month's rise, Carney said market expectations of a further 25 basis point rate rise at least once a year for the next few years was a reasonable rule of thumb.
Tuesday's data showed businesses faced growing difficulties hiring, echoing a common message in private-sector surveys of firms.
The economy added just 3,000 jobs in the three months to July -- the smallest increase since a fall in the three months to October -- taking the number of people in work to 32.397 million. 
That was less than the net hiring of 28,000 forecast by economists, and the number of job vacancies rose to a fresh record high
The jobless rate held steady at 4.0 percent, its joint-lowest since 1975, as forecast. 

""The labor market remains robust, with the number of people working still at historically high levels,"" ONS statistician David Freeman said.

The sentiment index dropped to 4 points from 7, according to a National Australia Bank Ltd. survey conducted in the week following Aug. 24 -- the day Scott Morrison was elevated to leader of the Liberal Party and the nation. More positively, business conditions, which measures hiring, sales and profits, advanced to 15 points from 13.
“The main thing that political instability does is just stifle investment and so weaken the economy,” Mark Crosby, a professor of economics at Monash University, said in the wake of the leadership turmoil. Historically, business sentiment in Australia has tended to track the fortunes of the government in office as firms are more confident in a stable environment.
The Reserve Bank of Australia has kept its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 1.5 percent for the past two years as it seeks to encourage companies to invest and hire. The approach has been gradually paying dividends: unemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent and capital expenditure has been advancing in recent years -- despite dipping in the second quarter -- and is forecast to keep improving.
Policy makers are trying to push the jobless rate down toward 5 percent, a level estimated to make it harder to find qualified employees and so encourage firms to offer higher wages to attract the right people. That, in turn, is expected to fuel inflation and lay the ground for the first rate hike Down Under since 2010.
Australia has changed prime minister six times since 2007, the worst bout of political upheaval in at least four decades.
NAB said the employment index, which held steady at 10, “is consistent with jobs growth of around 23,000 per month. This is consistent with a declining unemployment rate over the latter part of 2018.”
Economists are predicting the economy added 18,000 jobs and unemployment held at 5.3 percent in August ahead of monthly employment data to be released Thursday.

The National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions released on Tuesday regained 2 points to stand at +15 in August, well above the long-run average of +6.
The survey's measure of profitability climbed 6 points to +16 in August, recovering all of July's dip, while its sales index added 1 point to a strong +19.
In a promising development, the survey's employment index held firm at +10.
""The employment index continues to suggest growth in employment of around 23,000 per month over the next 6 months,"" said NAB group chief economist Alan Oster.
""With a stabilization in the labor force participation rate, this should be enough to see the unemployment rate decline further over the rest of 2018.""
The official jobs report for August is due on Thursday and is expected to show the jobless rate stayed at a six-year low of 5.3 percent.
The survey's often volatile measure of business confidence dipped 3 points to +4 in August.
The poll was taken just after the ruling Liberal Party ousted former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and replaced him with Treasurer Scott Morrison.
The center-right Liberal National Coalition has since slumped in opinion polls, leaving the center-left Labor Party in a commanding position to win the next election.
Still, firms reported strength in their own businesses, with forward orders rising and investment plans picking up outside the mining sector.
""In combination with a rebound in business conditions this month, this suggests that the business sector has continued to perform strongly as we enter the second half of 2018,"" said Oster.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has highlighted the resilience of business conditions as it forecast economic growth would top 3 percent this year and next.
Surveyed measures of inflation rose in August with labor and purchase costs higher, though growth remains subdued compared with history.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Valero and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) urged U.S. regulators to expedite a hearing on the fee structure of the largest fuel pipeline in the United States that they allege is costing them millions of dollars. 
Delays in a hearing on Colonial Pipeline's rates by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is costing, ""at a minimum,"" about $4.95 million per month, the companies said in filing late on Friday.
Chevron Products Co, Valero Marketing & Supply Co and Epsilon Trading LLC, the trading arm of Delta, filed a complaint with FERC in November that said Colonial's fees ""greatly exceed just and reasonable levels.""
The complaint, which has been pending with FERC for nine months, also alleged Colonial overcharged the companies by more than $60 million combined over a two-year period, and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region. 
Colonial connects Gulf Coast refineries with markets across the southern and eastern United States through more than 5,500 miles of its pipeline system, delivering gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products. 
In the new filing, the companies request that FERC set a hearing for the complaints against Colonial, saying that the delay by FERC is ""abnormal,"" while ""prejudicing"" the companies.
FERC spokeswoman Tamara Young-Allen declined to comment on the filing, saying it is policy not to comment on a pending Commission decision. Colonial did no immediately comment. 
Colonial has previously said the complaint filed in November has no merit and that the shippers manipulated data ""and made improper and highly unrealistic assumptions in an effort to strengthen their arguments."" 

The U.S. Congress set Colonial's rates in 1990s-era legislation. In 2001, FERC allowed Colonial to charge market-based rates from the Gulf Coast to the Philadelphia and New York areas, on the understanding that Colonial lacked monopoly power over those markets.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",UK enjoys fastest growth in almost a year after World Cup and weather boost,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain reeled off its fastest economic growth for nearly a year in the three months to July thanks to strong consumer spending lifted by the World Cup and unusually warm weather, official figures showed on Monday.
Gross domestic product in the three months to July was 0.6 percent higher than in the previous three-month period, the Office for National Statistics said, gathering pace from 0.4 percent growth in the three months to June - and at the top end of forecasts in a Reuters poll.
This was the fastest growth since August 2017 and should reassure the Bank of England, which raised interest rates last month for the second time in more than a decade, forecasting third-quarter growth of 0.4 percent but only a lackluster 2018 expansion of 1.4 percent.
Sterling was little changed on the data, which economists said showed an economy growing better than hoped after a slow start to 2018, even taking into account the effect of one-off factors.
""Far from running out of steam, UK activity has picked up after a very poor start to the year. Monthly data is choppy, but this pick-up shows that the UK is entering the crucial phase of Brexit talks in better shape than seemed likely six months ago,"" Deloitte economist Ian Stewart said.
Britain's economy has slowed since the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, its annual growth rate slipping from top spot among the Group of Seven rich nations to jostling with long-term laggards Japan and Italy for bottom place.
Some business surveys have shown firms delaying investment plans while the terms on which Britain will leave the EU on March 29 continue to remain unclear, posing the risk of disruption to existing trade arrangements. 
Monday's data showed that compared with a year earlier, GDP growth in July alone was up 1.6 percent, while it was 0.3 percent higher than in June, again above poll forecasts for 1.4 percent annual growth and a 0.2 percent monthly gain.
Consumers have been squeezed for more than a year by the jump in inflation which followed the pound's tumble after the 2016 referendum, especially as wages have failed to keep up.
That said, in recent months industry surveys have shown that an unusually warm summer encouraged many Britons to splash out on drinks and pub and restaurant visits.
Last week, closely watched purchasing managers' data pointed to third-quarter growth of 0.4 percent, as a pick-up in services activity outweighed a slowdown in manufacturing and construction activity.
Monday's data showed that Britain's dominant services sector grew by 0.6 percent in the three months to July, its biggest rise since January 2017, while 3.3 percent growth in the much smaller construction sector was the fastest since February 2017.
""We suspect, given the strength in the 'distribution, hotels and restaurants' sub-sector, the warm weather was a big help here, and probably so too was England's performance in the World Cup,"" Investec economist Philip Shaw said.
A fall in factory output largely reflected the volatile pharmaceuticals sector, he added. 
Industrial output contracted by 0.5 percent over the period, hurt by falls across manufacturing, oil and gas extraction and electricity generation, and second-quarter construction orders fell sharply.
Nonetheless, Britain's trade deficit in both goods alone and goods and services fell to its smallest since February, beating economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
The goods trade deficit dropped to 9.973 billion pounds ($12.90 billion) in July from 10.679 billion the month before, and the total trade deficit in goods and services fell to just 111 million pounds.
Britain's deficit in goods trade with the European Union was its smallest since April 2016, while global goods exports in the three months to July grew 2.3 percent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Home prices and property investment in China are expected to rise more this year than first thought, as tight controls in big cities continue to push buyers into less-regulated smaller markets, a Reuters poll showed.
The pick-up could offer much-needed support to China's slowing economy as the United States ratchets up tariffs on Chinese goods, though policy makers are likely to remain keenly aware of the risk of property bubbles.
House prices in China – where a near-three-year real estate boom has spilled over from megacities to the hinterland - will rise 5 percent this year and 3.3 percent in the first half of 2019, according to the Reuters poll of 16 property analysts and economists.
That outpaces the 1 percent gain seen in a previous poll in March and would only be marginally slower than the actual increase of 5.4 percent in 2017.
Property investment is now expected to grow 8 percent this year, higher than the last poll's 5 percent, as developers look to rebuild their housing inventories and as the construction of public housing accelerates.
""Although escalating Sino-US trade conflicts will affect China's GDP, the domestic housing market is still driven by local supply and demand so it is unlikely to change course in the short term,"" said David Ji, head of research and consultancy for Greater China at property consultancy Knight Frank.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Friday he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days.
BOOM BUT NO BUST?
China's housing market -- a major economic growth driver -- took off in early 2016 as the government eased curbs on buyers to help spur the slowing economy and reduce high inventories of unsold homes in smaller cities.
But the ensuing boom soon triggered concerns of a speculative bubble, forcing authorities to take action such as restricting lending to the sector and sharply raising the bar for purchasers. The moves helped to cut home price inflation by more than half in 2017 from a double-digit pace in 2016.
Still, analysts expect many less-regulated cities to continue riding the boom for awhile longer.
Pent-up demand is spilling over from residents of strictly-controlled tier-1 and tier-2 cities, while price rises in smaller cities and towns are encouraging more local buyers to take the plunge amid strong government support to reduce home inventories.
China has invested 990 billion yuan ($143.63 billion) into a massive urban redevelopment project through the Pledged Supplementary Lending (PSL) program, which has been largely used for cash compensation to residents whose homes are demolished.
China's property investment growth accelerated to its quickest pace in nearly two years in July, while property sales and new construction starts also quickened.
""Resilient sentiment and generally modest inventories of unsold housing will support house prices,"" said Tianjie He from Oxford Economics. 
Sheng Songcheng, a policy adviser to the central bank, warned on Monday that China's misinformed housing policies have distorted the market, and the country's housing inventories have in reality fallen to an alarmingly low level.
Only one analyst polled by Reuters expected home prices to fall in 2018.
POLICY EASING?
While Beijing is easing overall credit conditions in the face of slowing domestic demand, analysts think it will be more cautious about stimulating property investment than it has been in past downturns.
Most market watchers believe authorities will maintain their clampdown on illegal financing to the property sector, but their views diverged on whether regulators will ease restrictions on cash-starved developers' access to other sources of funding. 
""Property developers would not suffer a lot,"" said Iris Pang, an economist with ING bank in Singapore. 
""The next question is whether their roll-over of bonds would suffer from a higher interest cost. But as SHIBOR has come down quite a lot, we don't see it as a big issue for most developers,"" Pang said, referring to a recent moderation in interbank rates following fund injections by the central bank. 
Meanwhile, Chinese housing appears steadily less affordable, posing a longer-term risk as household debt rises and consumers have less to spend on other purchases. 
Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 7, up from analysts' estimates of 6 in the last poll.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 01:41AM ET</span>","Capex drives Japan's fastest expansion since 2016, seen backing growth","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Heavy capital spending in the second quarter drove Japan's economy to its fastest growth since 2016, underscoring the view that capex continues to back the economy even as trade tensions and a string of natural disasters pose risks to the outlook.
Revised Cabinet office data out on Monday showed the economy grew an annualized 3.0 percent in April-June, handily beating economists' median estimate for 2.6 percent gain and the initial estimate of a 1.9 percent expansion.
It was the fastest expansion since first-quarter 2016. 
The economy's improved performance should be a relief for policymakers worried over fallout from a trade war between the United States and China, which could derail global growth and in turn damage Japan's export-reliant economy.
Capital expenditure has been a bright spot in Japan's economy, the world's third largest, although companies remain cautious about sharing more of their profits with workers, keeping a lid on private consumption and inflation.
""The environment surrounding capex is favorable thanks to labor-saving investment because of labor shortages, construction demand related to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and inbound tourism, and research and development, on top of hefty company profits,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The Bank of Japan's tankan survey has indicated there's a strong appetite for business investment. As such, capex is likely to remain in an uptrend to underpin the economy ahead.""
The updated second-quarter growth showed quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.7 percent in real, price-adjusted terms, compared with an initial reading of a 0.5 percent growth and the median estimate for a 0.7 percent gain.
UPTREND
The capital expenditure component of GDP grew 3.1 percent in April-June from the previous quarter, versus the median forecast for 2.8 percent growth, and the preliminary 1.3 percent gain.
That was the fastest increase since the start of 2015, driven by transport and postal services, and electrical and chemical industries.
The upbeat GDP data followed a finance ministry survey that last week showed corporate capex rose at the fastest pace in 11 years in the second quarter, driven by procurement of production equipment for cars and semiconductors.
Still, a recent run of soft data such as exports and factory output, has cast doubt on the robustness of recent growth.
A series of disasters including floods, last week's typhoon and an earthquake, prompted some analysts to forecast a contraction in the current quarter.
""Japan's exports and factory output are set to slow in July-September as supply and shipments are constrained due to natural disasters and inbound tourism slumps,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Japan's economy may suffer a temporary contraction in this quarter.""
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, grew 0.7 percent in April-June from the previous three months, unchanged from the preliminary estimate.

Domestic demand contributed 0.9 percentage points to revised GDP, while net exports - or exports minus imports - shaved 0.1 percentage point off the second quarter growth.

In recent decades, Australia debt-to-income ratio has risen to be in the top quarter of developed economies, Bullock, who oversees the financial system, said in the text of a speech in the regional city of Albury-Wodonga Monday.
“This raises potential vulnerabilities in both bank and household balance sheets,” she said. “While the risks are high, there are a number of factors that suggest widespread financial stress among households is not imminent. It is nevertheless an area that we continue to monitor closely.”
A key mitigating factor is that about two-thirds of the debt is held by the wealthiest 40 percent of households; on top of that, the RBA has consistently noted that borrowers have been using low interest rates to pay down their mortgages quicker and build up financial buffers. At the institutional level, Bullock said Australian banks are well capitalized and have tightened their lending standards.
Australia’s household debt-to-income ratio is at a record 190 percent, fueled in recent years by the central bank cutting rates to a record low 1.5 percent. That contributed to a surge in house prices that required larger mortgages to finance purchases. Regulators have sought to limit mortgages to property investors, which has helped cool prices.

Consumer inflation, on the other hand, picked up more than expected in August, though policy makers are likely to stay focused on growth rather than pricing pressures as U.S. President Donald Trump raises the stakes in the tariff war.
The producer price index (PPI), a gauge of industrial profitability, rose 4.1 percent in August from a year earlier, compared with a 4.6 percent increase in July, according to data released by the National Statistics Bureau on Monday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected August PPI would rose to 4.0 percent. On a monthly basis, PPP picked up from 0.1 percent in July to 0.4 percent in August. 
Raw material prices rose 7.8 percent in August from a year earlier, compared with a 9.0 percent increase in July. 
""Despite soft industrial output in the third quarter, domestic polices such as boosting infrastructure spending could provide some support to prices of related industrial goods in the fourth quarter,” said Betty Wang, Hong Kong-based senior China economist at ANZ, noting that month-on-month PPI growth has been picking up.
China's economic growth cooled slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter, though worries about a sharper slowdown have increased in recent months amid rocky trade relations with the United States. 
The two countries have already slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion of each other's goods, and U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States.
With domestic and foreign demand slowing, and export orders in both official and private factory surveys extending their declines in August, investors have cause to be nervous about China's outlook.
POLICY SUPPORT
China's policy makers are trying to keep the economy on an even keel as the dispute with the United States threatens to dent output.
The government has responded by loosening its liquidity tap in money markets and speeding up infrastructure projects as it eyes expansionary fiscal policy to support growth. Beijing has approved new railways in six cities in August.
On a year-on-year basis, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent in August, fastest pace since February this year and above expectations of 2.2 percent. It also accelerated from July's 2.1 percent. 
The food price index climbed 1.7 percent from a year earlier as vegetable prices rose and pork prices rebounded, while non-food prices grew 2.5 percent in August. 
On a month-on-month basis, the CPI increased 0.7 percent.
Since August, China has reported multiple African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks that have pushed up pork prices in the country's south as demand grows ahead of a week-long holiday in October and also raised the prospect of more imports.
However, analysts say that while ASF has increased the upside risk to the inflation outlook, the impact would most likely be small.
""Improvements in China's disease management and pork's lower CPI weighting these days suggest that any pick-up in inflation this time around would be more moderate,"" said Chang Liu, a London-based China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note last week.
Beijing would be unlikely to respond by raising interest rates even if the disease becomes widespread, Liu said, adding that Chinese officials tend to prioritize economic growth when faced with a combination of slowing momentum and rising inflation. 
That view was echoed by vice-chairman of state planner Ning Jizhe in comments in August that inflation will not present a big problem this year.
China has set an inflation goal of 3 percent for 2018, same as last year. 

The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.0 percent in August, compared with 1.9 percent in July.

The producer price index climbed 4.1 percent, compared with the 4 percent estimate and a 4.6 percent gain the previous month.
Spreading swine fever, floods in a key vegetable-producing region and soaring rent in big cities all have economists concerned about rising inflation risks amid the slowing economy, although the consumer price index still remains well below the government ceiling of 3 percent. The situation is undesirable for corporate China, as their profits can be eroded by a slowdown in factory-gate prices while their costs would rise with the consumer gauge.

The CPI may rise further into September, while PPI growth will continue to moderate to near zero at the end of the year, Jiang Chao, fixed-income analyst at Haitong Securities Co., wrote in a recent note. ""The central bank doesn’t need to increase rates due to concerns on currency depreciation or inflation pressure, and the monetary conditions will remain eased.""

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2018 12:02PM ET</span>",Ban cheese imports? Pakistan discusses outside-the-box ideas to avoid IMF bailout,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani economic advisors discussed banning imports of luxury cars, smartphones and cheese in a wide-ranging strategy session on how to avoid seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a senior government advisor said.
While no decisions were made, the floating of radical measures to tackle Pakistan's ballooning current account deficit by the newly formed Economic Advisory Council (EAC) underscores the new government's determination to avoid another IMF bailout.
The EAC held its first session last week, chaired by Finance Minister Asad Umar, who took office last month.
A lull in Pakistani exports and a relative spike in imports has led to a shortage of dollars in the economy, putting pressure on the local currency and dwindling foreign currency reserves.
That has prompted most financial analysts to predict Pakistan will turn to the IMF for its 15th bailout since the early 1980s. But new Prime Minister Imran Khan has criticized a culture of dependency and his party's officials have expressed concerns that the reforms and austerity the IMF might demand would strangle promised government spending.
Ashfaque Hasan Khan, a university professor who is one of more than a dozen EAC members, told Reuters that during Thursday's meeting, the focus was on outside-the-box ideas that would help curb imports.
""I didn't find any member (who) suggested that Pakistan should go to the IMF because there is no other alternative,"" he said. ""We need to take some actions. 'Do nothing' scenario is unacceptable.""
Umar could not be reached for comment on the EAC meeting. He recently told the Senate that while Pakistan needs to meet a $9 billion financing requirement, the IMF should only be a fallback option.
Khan said the more radical steps discussed were a year-long ban on imports for cheese, cars, cell phones and fruit that could ""save some $4-5 billion"". A push on exports could generate up to $2 billion in extra inflows, he added.
""You see how much cheese is coming in this country from abroad,"" Khan said. ""Market is full of imported cheese. Does this country, which doesn't have dollars, deserve this, that it is importing cheese?""
Last year, the previous government hiked tariffs by up to 50 percent on 240 imported items, including cheese and high-horsepower cars, and imposed regulatory duties on dozens of new imports. But no outright import bans were issued.
Umar recently said Pakistan would not rule out asking ""friendly nations"" - usually code for historic allies China and Saudi Arabia - for assistance to avoid going to the IMF, as well as raising money on international debt markets.
The current account deficit widened by 43 percent to $18 billion in the year ended June 30, hit by a jump in oil prices. Pakistan imports about 80 percent of its oil needs.

To ease current account pressures, Pakistan's central bank has devalued the rupee four times since December, while interest rates have been hiked three times this year.

In her regular weekly podcast, Merkel said the government would use its 2019 budget - due to be debated in parliament next week - to invest in helping the long-term unemployed get back to work with a view to achieving full employment by 2025.
Europe's largest economy is enjoying a sustained period of growth and unemployment is running at 5.2 percent.
This week, the Ifo economic institute raised its 2018 growth forecast for Germany to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent previously, citing better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year.
Yet economic data this week pointed to industry taking a hit from U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies.
Merkel, citing ""very good tax revenue"" this year, said her government planned to invest in roads, rail tracks and digital infrastructure, as well as reducing Germany's debt burden to 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), from 64 percent last year.
""We are providing for times when the economy may not be performing so well by investing and thus creating the conditions so that we can still have an economic recovery for as long as possible,"" Merkel said.
Der Spiegel magazine, quoting Finance Ministry figures, reported that in the first half of this year alone, the government enjoyed a budget surplus of more than 10 billion euros ($11.55 billion).
This surplus meant Finance Minister Olaf Scholz would not need to dip into a reserve fund for financing housing, catering and German lessons for refugees, Spiegel reported.
The fund has 24 billion euros and budget planning allows Scholz to use 1.6 billion of it this year, but the surplus means he will not need to, the magazine said.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","EIB considering capital hike, changes to shareholding post Brexit","VIENNA (Reuters) - The European Investment Bank (EIB), owned by European Union governments, is considering a capital increase to allow some of its shareholders to increase their stake after Britain pulls out of the EU and the EIB in March next year, EU officials said.
Britain's exit will mean that the bank will lose 3.5 billion euros ($4.04 billion) of British paid-in capital. That money will be replenished by other existing shareholders on a proportional basis, one EU official said.
The world's largest multilateral borrower and lender, the EIB relies on its AAA credit rating to borrow on the market and then lend on for investment projects. It works closely with other EU institutions to implement EU policy.
Replacing the UK capital after Brexit will be important for the bank to keep its top credit rating.
Separately, the bank is working on a plan to raise capital to allow some countries, like Poland, to raise their holding.
""Poland has been vocal that it wants to increase its stake in the EIB, because the size of its economy has grown substantially since it entered the European Union in 2004,"" the official said. 
The stake that each EU country has in the EIB is based on its economic weight within the bloc on the basis of its gross domestic product (GDP) at the time of its accession.
Poland entered the EU in 2004 with a GDP of around $217 billion, but by last year its economy had almost tripled in size to around $614 billion.
It is therefore bigger than Sweden, Denmark, Belgium or Austria, all of which have bigger stakes in the EIB. The biggest shareholders in the EIB, apart from Britain, are Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
Because changes to EIB capital are rare, and usually happen only at the time when the EU accepts a new member, Poland wants to use the change forced by Brexit to review its stake, EU officials said. 
Spain is also interested in raising its holding, they said, although it was not clear how much capital on top of that required by the Brexit rejig it was willing to contribute.
""There are two or three other countries from central and eastern Europe and the south who also want to increase their stake,"" the EU official said.
Poland has declared it was ready to inject up to 10 billion euros into the EIB, officials said. In exchange, it wants to secure the post of a permanent vice president at the bank.
EIB financing in Poland was 5.1 billion euros in 2017, making the country the fifth largest recipient of EIB loans last year.
The EIB is to prepare a simulation of the capital increase and its potential consequences for its rating for a meeting in Bucharest on September 17, officials said.
The bank now has 243.3 billion euros of capital, of which 21.7 billion is paid in. Most of its investment activity is in Europe but it is also a big investor around the world.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 07:57PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. sales could ease profit worries into 2019,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A healthy outlook for U.S. revenue growth stands to soothe stock investors worried about the effect on corporate profits from tax cuts wearing off next year.
S&P 500 revenue growth, which hit 9.5 percent in the second quarter, its fastest pace since 2011, is estimated at 8.2 percent for 2018, according to Thomson Reuters data.
While that growth is expected to slow to 5 percent next year, it is still at the high end of the historical average. The falloff is not as steep as that expected in earnings growth, which received a big boost this year from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that slashed the corporate income tax rate.
That could ease some investors' concerns about profit growth, which is hitting its peak for the cycle this year, while risks are increasing from costs related to tariffs, rising interest rates and a strengthening U.S. dollar.
""The revenue growth more than offsets any of the concerns we have on the earnings side,"" said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
""Of course there's peak earnings growth. We had tax cuts,"" he said. ""What we want to see is sustainable earnings growth driven by the top line, which is exactly what we're seeing right now.""
The revenue gains are being driven by strong demand from economic growth, with gross domestic product rising at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years.
At least part of the boost to revenue is coming from the robust U.S. labor market, while capital spending is also helping, said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
Data on Friday showed U.S. wages in August notched their largest annual increase in nine years, suggesting consumer spending will stay strong.
Rising wages are likely to become a bigger risk to earnings at some point, but that might not happen until 2020, said Patrick Palfrey, vice president and equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities in New York.
""Right now the earnings story is a revenue story. It is really allowing companies to continue to drive that bottom line growth, and it will be able to make up for any bump in the road from higher costs,"" Palfrey said. 
Most economists polled by Reuters in late August expected economic growth to edge off the recent four-year high in the coming quarters but still saw little chance of a recession over the next two years.
The tax cut package, the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years, resulted in a surge in profit growth, creating a peak later in the earnings cycle than typically, strategists said.
Analysts have forecast S&P 500 earnings growth at 23.3 percent for 2018 - the highest annual growth since 2010 - and at 10.2 percent for 2019, based on Thomson Reuters data.
Earnings grew an estimated 24.9 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, and analysts expect growth of 22.3 percent for the third quarter, based on Thomson Reuters data. 
Results can continue to increase even after growth peaks, strategists said. For example, S&P 500 earnings growth peaked in the fourth quarter of 2003, yet remained in the double-digit range for at least three years after that, while revenue stayed well above trend in that period, said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, an independent research firm.
He said in the last 80 years, S&P 500 earnings growth averaged about 6 to 8 percent a year, while sales grew about 3 to 5 percent.

""Early indications are that this is looking like 2003, where we could see above-trend growth persist longer than consensus expects,"" Raich said. ""When you have this type of revenue growth, companies can extend above-trend profit growth.""

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 02:03PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth surges; annual wage gain largest since 2009,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in August and wages notched their largest annual increase in more than nine years, the clearest signs that the economy was so far weathering the Trump administration's escalating trade war with China.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report published on Friday also showed slack in the jobs market was rapidly diminishing, with a broader measure of unemployment falling to a level not seen since 2001. The report cemented expectations for a third interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year when policymakers meet on Sept. 25-26.
Analysts say the administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending were shielding the economy from the trade tensions, which have also seen Washington engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs with other trade partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico. 
""With the tax cuts and spending increases creating a sugar high, there is little reason to expect labor demand to moderate over the rest of this year or even in the first half of next,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 201,000 jobs last month, boosted by hiring at construction sites, wholesalers and professional and business services, the Labor Department said. There were also gains in transportation and healthcare employment.
(Graphic: U.S. wage growth accelerated in August: https://reut.rs/2oOs0cX)
Average hourly earnings increased 0.4 percent, or 10 cents in August after rising 0.3 percent in July. That raised the annual increase in wages to 2.9 percent in August, the largest gain since June 2009, from 2.7 percent in July. 
Wage growth has been the labor market's Achilles heel and last month's increase fit in with economists' expectations that inflation will continue to bounce around the Fed's 2 percent target for the remainder of this year and into early 2019.
""Even if we were to see a reversal of some of the monthly wage gains, short of a collapse, current levels support the Fed's symmetric 2 percent inflation target,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global market strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston. ""The market fully expects another hike in September.""
(Graphic: U.S. unemployment is near the lowest in 18 years: https://reut.rs/2wScWhZ)
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 7.4 percent in August, the lowest level since April 2001. 
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.9 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 191,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent. The economy created 50,000 fewer jobs in June and July than previously reported. 
Job growth averaged 185,000 per month in the past three months. The economy needs to create 120,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on the report, while U.S. Treasury yields rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
LIMITED IMPACT FROM TARIFFS
The employment report added to manufacturing and services industries surveys in suggesting the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy was having a marginal impact on the economy for now. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, almost double the 2.2 percent pace set in the January-March period.
Economists said the import duties implemented so far have affected only a small portion of the American economy, but warned this could change if President Donald Trump pressed ahead with additional tariffs on Chinese imports. 
The United States and China have slapped retaliatory tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July.
Trump on Friday said he was ready to impose tariffs on another $267 billion in Chinese goods, in addition to a $200 billion tariff list that is awaiting his decision. The tariffs on an additional $467 billion would raise duties on virtually all U.S. imports from China. 
The government imposed import duties on goods including steel, aluminum, washing machines, lumber and solar panels early this year to protect American industries from what Trump says is unfair foreign competition.
""If the tariffs on all the imports from China go into effect, significant layoffs will be inevitable with higher prices,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics in Los Angeles. 
Last month, the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent, a wrinkle on an otherwise upbeat employment report.
(Graphic: U.S. manufacturing employment: https://reut.rs/2wTpSUH)
Job gains in August were almost across all sectors, though manufacturing payrolls fell by 3,000. That was the first drop in 13 months and followed an increase of 18,000 in July. Employment at motor vehicle plants fell nearly 5,000, accounting for the bulk of the drop in manufacturing payrolls. 
Employment also declined in machinery, computer and electronic products as well as furniture industries.
""This should prove transitory as autos manufacturing payrolls tend to be noisy over the summer months as companies shut down production to retool for the next year's models, making seasonal adjustment factors less precise,"" said Joseph Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York. 
Construction companies hired 23,000 more workers last month after increasing payrolls by 18,000 jobs in July. Wholesalers added 22,400 jobs. Payrolls in the professional and business services industries rose by 53,000 positions.

Employment at sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores rebounded by 9,200 jobs in August after shedding 30,300 jobs in July related to the closing of all Toys-R-Us stores. But retail payrolls fell 5,900 and government shed 3,000 jobs.

The findings of the Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, come on the heels of data this week showing a less steep decline in construction spending in June than previously reported. 
Before the QSS data, economists had expected that GDP growth for the April-June quarter would be raised to an annualized rate of 4.3 percent from the 4.2 percent pace that the government reported last week in its second GDP estimate.
Based on the QSS data, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Macroeconomic Advisers estimated another one-tenth of a percentage point would be added to the GDP estimate. That means second-quarter GDP growth could be lifted to a 4.4 percent rate when the government publishes its second revision later this month.
""We think that the QSS data imply a small upward revision to 2Q consumption and a very small downward revision to intellectual property products investment,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
In its second GDP estimate last week, the government lowered second-quarter consumer spending growth to a 3.8 percent pace from the 4.0 percent rate when then government published its advance GDP growth estimate back in July. 

Economists said Friday's QSS data showed more spending at nonprofit hospitals and other sectors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. interest rates futures fell on Friday as stronger-than-forecast figures on the jobs market reinforced traders' expectation of more interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve to keep the economy from overheating. 
Traders expected the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central bank's policy-setting group, to raise key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point to 2.00-2.25 percent at its Sept. 25-26 meeting. 
This would mark the Fed's third rate increase in 2018 after raising rates in March and June.
“This is a solid report. It reinforced the view that the Fed will raise raises at the next meeting,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Domestic nonfarm payrolls grew by 201,000 in August, more than the 191,000 increase forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll.
The most upbeat aspect of the latest jobs report was the acceleration in wages, whose annual gain moved up to 2.9 percent last month, its strongest reading since June 2009.
""Everything is flashing green for a rate hike. I think a rate hike in December is very likely. The Fed has to hike rate at least three times next year, mostly likely four,"" Zandi said. 
At 9:32 a.m. (1332 GMT), federal funds futures signaled traders fully expect the Federal Open Market Committee to raise key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point to 2.00-2.25 percent at its Sept. 25-26 meeting. 
The fed funds contracts implied traders priced in a 76 percent chance of another quarter-point hike at its Dec. 18-19 meeting, up from 73 percent late on Thursday, CME Group's FedWatch program showed.

Wage inflation advanced more than expected, causing an initial pullback in U.S. stock futures, although investors quickly pared losses after the initial dip.
Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 201,000 in August, according to official data released on Friday.
The data was higher than the consensus estimate for the creation of 191,000 jobs and the 163,000 positions that the ADP report indicated on Thursday.
The previous month’s reading of NFP was revised to 147,000 from the 157,000 registered initially.
The jobless rate unexpectedly held steady at 3.9%. Analysts had expected it to tick down to 3.8%.
Average hourly earnings advanced 0.4% month-on-month in August, above expectations for a 0.3% gain.
On an annualized basis, wage inflation grew 2.9% in August.
Economists had estimated no change from July’s 2.7% rise.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
Average weekly hours clocked in at 34.5 last month. That was in line with the forecast and previous month’s reading.
Additionally, the private sector created more new job contracts than expected in August with a total of 204,000.
Analysts had forecast the creation of just 190,000 new private sector jobs.
June’s number was revised to an increase of 153,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 170,000 jobs in the private sector.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Italy should cut its structural budget deficit in line with European Union rules it has committed to respect, top euro zone officials said on Friday, amid signals from Rome that it wants to spend more and tax less next year.
Leaders of Italy's ruling coalition of the far-right League Matteo Salvini and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement Luigi Di Maio have been promising to cut taxes, introduce a universal income, lower the pension age and forego a value added tax increase next year.
To do that, Italy, which already has a debt of 132 percent of GDP, would have to increase its budget deficit, adding to market concern about its ability to repay.
""Italy has to reduce its structural deficit,"" European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici told journalists on arrival for a meeting of euro zone ministers in Vienna.
""I think it's in Italy's interest to have a budget that will allow Italy to reduce its public debt. We will talk about figures when the budget will be prepared. But the numbers are that Italy has to reduce its structural deficit,"" he said.
Last week, Fitch rating agency changed the outlook for Italian debt to negative from stable and investors have heavily sold off Italian bonds on concern over the higher spending plans since the government took office in June.
Yet Di Maio said last Sunday the government would first look after Italians before listening to ratings agencies and reassuring markets, in defiant remarks that worry euro zone policy-makers.
As the costs of borrowing for Italy rose, Di Maio and Salvini sought to tone down their rhetoric earlier this week, pledging not to increase the nominal budget deficit limit above the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP. But they said nothing about reducing the structural gap, as EU rules stipulate.
Italy, like all other euro zone countries, will have to submit its draft budget for next year to the European Commission by mid-October for checks if it is in line with EU rules. Should the draft blatantly break EU laws, the Commission has the option of sending it back to be changed.
EU rules oblige governments to keep cutting the structural deficit -- a measure that strips out the effects of the business cycle and one-off income and spending -- until the budget is in balance or in surplus. 
Under EU rules, Italy should cut its structural budget deficit, seen at 1.7 percent of GDP this year, by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2019. But, according to statements from Di Maio and Salvini, that is unlikely to happen. 
Even with no change in policies, let alone higher spending and tax cuts, the structural deficit will rise next year to 2.0 percent of GDP, the European Commission forecasts.
This puts Rome on a collision path with the Commission which has to enforce EU rules. 
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he assumed all EU members would adhere to EU rules.
""I think we all know that we in Europe have big tasks ahead of us. Everyone needs to sort out their own problems and I assume that everyone will adhere to EU rules,"" Scholz said.
Also, the head of euro zone finance ministers Mario Centeno noted Rome was bound by EU laws on borrowing.
""The Italian government has committed to follow ... the principles of the economic policy guidance in Europe,"" he told reporters.

Changes in inventories, household spending and government expenditure each contributed 0.1 percentage point.
However, while exports rose by 0.6 percent, imports also increased by 1.1 percent during the quarter, meaning the net impact of foreign trade on GDP was 0.2 percentage points.
Net trade was also negative in the first quarter of 2018, but positive in the final two quarters of 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Free Wi-Fi, discounted cappuccinos, artwork, and a dancing robot are among the features banks across the United States are touting to convince customers that even in an era of smartphones it is still worth it to visit a bank branch.
Banks are in a bind - branches are costly and keep losing traffic as phone apps take over day-to-day banking, but they need them because that is where customers still get advice, resolve tricky account issues or deal with cash and checks.
To square that circle banks have been trying to drum up more branch business with location upgrades and eye-catching features.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) branches, for example, feature local art, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) highlights new technologies at its ""technology bars,"" and at  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC's Fifth Avenue flagship New York branch a humanoid robot Pepper greets visitors with a wave and a wiggle.
However, wooing more customers with self-service kiosks, touchscreens, consulting zones and modern decor is just the start, consultants and designers say. The challenge is how to turn that into more sales and brand loyalty.
""Innovative designs have proven to be successful in driving additional traffic,"" said Brandon Larson, a managing director at financial consultancy Novantas. ""The thing people struggle with is, how do they convert that traffic into new deep relationships with the institution?"" 
In other words, can a cappuccino sell a mortgage?
Reuters interviews with eight patrons at  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) Corp's hybrid flagship bank-café in New York suggested it may be hard. Six said they were there to charge phones or enjoy an iced coffee, not to carry out any transactions or become bank customers.
""To me, the café is more of a public co-working space,"" said Chai Lee, 45, who regularly relaxes there. ""I really come in for the free Wi-fi.""
Lee, a Chase customer, said he had no plans to switch banks, and that his main consideration when opening an account was getting the best interest rate.

PART OF FAMILY
Jeremy Balkin, HSBC's head of innovation for the U.S. market said the Fifth Avenue branch opened 20 percent more accounts in July, the first full month of Pepper's assignment there, compared to a year earlier.
""Clearly Pepper has been a seismic historic intervention,"" Balkin said. ""We don't see it as marketing. Pepper is part of our family in the branch.""
Capital One considers its cafe model so successful that it is adding new locations in Washington D.C. and San Diego to the existing network of 33 cafes run in cooperation with coffee chain Peet's Coffee.
Lia Dean, Capital One's head of bank marketing and retail, told Reuters that half of those frequenting its cafes were not customers, which was good because more people get familiar with the brand. Dean would not discuss the effects on profits or new account openings, but said: ""We would not be expanding them if we weren't pleased."" 
If done right, branch redesigns can boost sales and reduce costs by 60 to 70 percent thanks in part to lower staffing and space needs, according to a July study by McKinsey management consulting firm. But doing it right means spending heavily on back-end technology to bring information now scattered across various businesses in one place and investing in training so a single employee can help a customer with a range of questions.
Bank executives say integrating technology across apps, web portals, ATMs and physical locations is a complex, time-consuming operation, but they are moving in that direction. 
""We recognize that our best customers and most engaged are ones using both branches as well as digital,"" said Sol Gindi, chief administrative officer for Chase. Around 75 percent of Chase's customers use both the bank's mobile app and its branches, he said.
In response, Chase launched Finn, a digital-only bank that targets younger customers, but also plans to add 400 new branches to its nationwide network of around 5,100 branches over the next five years. [nL1N1TS1PQ]
Similarly, Bank of America is adding another 500 locations and redesigning 1,500 over the next four years. As of February, it has opened more than 160 new centers and renovated 620 after closing some 1,500 branches in the wake of the crisis.
""Is it worth the investment? It's a question we've grappled with,"" Jon Wolf, Bank of America's senior vice president of Consumer Business Transformation, told Reuters. ""However, I think we're done grappling: branches are a critical part of what our customers want."" 
HSBC, which mainly targets international customers in the United States, recently made ""a sizable investment"" to replace its main U.S. technology platform, according to its spokesman Matt Klein.
Building on its technology investments the bank plans to launch early next year a new mobile app and new online banking capabilities, Klein said. Now, HSBC's app is rated 1.4 out of 5 in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's U.S. App Store, well below its peers.
GLOBAL DILEMMA
The question becomes, though, how much to commit to branches that are important now, but may end up like video rental stores - upended by technology and changing consumer habits.
It is a global dilemma, but for banks in the United States the challenge is especially daunting. 
While rivals in parts of Europe and Asia are further ahead with their digital products and branch redesigns and their customers more comfortable shifting online, U.S. banks find it hard to compete without a strong branch network.(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2oKW1Kp)
Those that shuttered thousands of branches to slash costs in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis ended up losing customers or deposits.
Yet with branch networks estimated to account for 10 to 30 percent of total costs, investors have been pushing executives to make branches work harder.
Rising interest rates and growing importance of deposits as a low-cost financing source have only added urgency to banks' search for the best branch strategy.
Some analysts, however scoff at branch redesigns, saying they may create some buzz, but banks should rather spend the money to improve their digital products. They say U.S. customers visit branches so often not necessarily because they want to, but because they get frustrated with the technology. 

""Who do you know who actually wants to go to a bank for a simple transaction?"" said Sam Maule, a managing partner for North America at financial services consultancy 11:FS. ""You're forced to go for things like account opening and, in my opinion, it's because the digital offering sucks.""

The 0.4 percent rise in real wages in July from a year earlier followed a revised 2.5 percent annual increase in June, which was the biggest gain in more than 21 years, labor ministry data showed on Friday.
Summer bonuses boosted real wages in June, so a slowdown was expected in July, but the Bank of Japan is likely to be encouraged that three straight months of gains show upward pressure on wages is finally increasing.
Higher wages suggest it will be easier for the BOJ's monetary policy to generate sustained inflation.
Nominal cash earnings rose 1.5 percent year-on-year in July, slower than a revised 3.5 percent annual increase in June.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, grew 1.1 percent in July from a year earlier. Special one-off payments, which include summer bonuses, rose an annual 2.2 percent after a revised 6.2 percent annual increase in July.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, rose 1.9 percent year-on-year versus an annual 3.5 percent increase in June.
Major Japanese firms typically pay bonuses twice a year, once during the summer and once near year's end.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) report also showed starting salaries for permanent staff picked up last month at the second-fastest pace in more than three years.
Overall the monthly survey, produced with data firm IHS Markit, added to signs of a tightening labor market in Britain, with companies struggling to find the workers they need.
Net migration of European Union nationals into Britain has fallen markedly since British voters opted to leave the bloc in a June 2016 referendum.
But employment has continued to grow strongly and the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest levels since the mid-1970s.
""How long our labor market can defy gravity if the shape of our future trading arrangements with the EU remain unclear is the big question,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
""Companies are starting to implement contingency plans now -- and those who aren't will need to step up progress.""
Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to strike a deal with the EU on Britain's departure from the bloc, raising the prospect of an economically damaging Brexit in less than seven months' time.
Despite the fall in unemployment, official wage growth measures have not risen notably although they are largely in line with the forecasts of the Bank of England. It raised interest rates last month, saying it saw signs of inflation pressure from the labor market.

Official data last month showed net migration of European Union citizens into Britain fell to its lowest level since 2012 in the year to March, but this was more than outweighed by a record influx of non-EU citizens.

Accountancy and business advisory firm BDO said its monthly High Street Sales Tracker (HSST) showed like-for-like sales dropped 2.7 percent in August from a year earlier.
That marked the seventh straight month that in-store sales have fallen.
Above-target inflation and sluggish wage growth are denting spending on goods other than food, while a record-breaking summer heatwave made spending in bars and on entertainment more appealing than shopping. 
In the fashion sector, in-store sales fell every week in August, and by more than 3 percent during three of those weeks, for their worst performance since 2015.
Homeware sales did even worse, slumping 6.1 percent - the sub-sector's worst performance August since 2012.
In contrast, online sales of all goods jumped 13.7 percent.
""In a climate of rising interest rates, prices rising and subdued real wage growth, there is limited discretionary spend left and that is taking its toll on fashion and homeware sales, especially bigger-ticket items,"" said Sophie Michael, BDO's head of retail and wholesale.
A survey published by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) on Tuesday reported sluggish sales growth for August.
Recent trading updates from retailers have also been subdued.

On Thursday electricals and mobile phones retailer Dixons Carphone (L:DC) reported flat underlying sales in its latest quarter, while department store John Lewis [JLPLC.UL] said on Tuesday that its total sales rose just 1.3 percent in the five weeks to Sept. 1.

Tourism accounts for around 11 percent of economic output and the sector is Spain's biggest employer, but a fall in the number of visitors in the key month of July suggested growth may be peaking after several record years.
Hotels in the sea-front city saw occupancy rates slip only fractionally in the period but a 7 percent cut in prices in July and a 19 percent reduction in August dragged down takings.
By contrast, the average spend of international tourists in Spain as a whole rose 9.5 percent in July.
Trade group Gremi d'Hotels de Barcelona criticized city hall's approach to tourism and warned that the city's image had been damaged by a deterioration in public safety, rising anti-social behavior and insufficient cleaning in public spaces.
Group president Jordi Clos highlighted a reported assault by a street vendor on a tourist from the United States and an increase in crimes like watch thefts in hotel doorways.

He also laid blame on political instability - in an apparent reference to a secession bid which led Madrid to impose direct rule last year - airport strikes and the memory of a deadly terrorist attack last August.

As holder of the bloc's rotating presidency for the rest of the year, Austria will host the discussion on ""financial stability implications of increasing interest rates"" when policymakers meet in Vienna on Friday and Saturday, a document seen by Reuters said.
Talks on coping with normalized monetary policy would not be abnormal, but sending a message to the ECB would be highly unusual, and seen as an encroachment on the bank's prerogative to set borrowing costs for the bloc.
Austrian Finance Minister Hartwig Loeger said putting pressure on the ECB was not his country's intention.
""In no case will the council (of finance ministers) steer the ECB's monetary policy or influence its decisions,"" Loeger told reporters when asked about the planned discussion.
The ECB has kept rates record low for years as inflation remains below its target rate, brushing off critics, including Austria's own central bank chief.
Policymakers in the bloc's core states argue that inflation is already high enough for rates to rise, but ECB chief Mario Draghi says it sets policy for the euro zone as a whole and not just its wealthier members who have already recovered from the bloc's crisis.
While the ECB has already unveiled plans to end its purchases of government bonds this year, it said that interest rates will remain on hold for at least for another year.
Rather than seeking to lean on the ECB, Austria wanted finance ministers to be well prepared for an increase in rates before it happens, Loeger said.
""The ECB has signaled that a normalization of monetary policy will take place in 2019. It is clear that this will affect states' refinancing and the economy,"" Loeger said. 

""It is therefore essential to grapple with the resulting questions at an early stage and to identify potential fiscal policy measures.""

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Emerging market currencies due a bounce after crazy August: Reuters poll,"By Vuyani Ndaba
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Many emerging market currencies, which have had a torrid few months, will bounce back at least partially against the dollar in a year as weakening growth momentum takes the shine off the greenback, a Reuters poll found.
The rand is expected to firm almost 10 percent to 14.00 per dollar in a year, the Brazilian real just over 8 percent to 3.79 per dollar, and the heavily-sold Argentine peso over 10 percent to 34.135 per dollar. [BRL/POLL]
""At these (current) levels, a lot of the bad news is priced in,"" said Mike Keenan, a strategist at Absa Capital. 
""We think the rand sell-off is probably overdone, even though we acknowledge it is vulnerable to tighter monetary policy conditions globally, twin deficits and an unwind of the carry trade.""
Most strategists surveyed in August did not expect such a broad sell-off for the likes of the rand and the real so soon -- or one of such ferocity.
""The move happened much faster than I had anticipated. I expected dollar/rand to trade higher, but those levels (came) sooner than I anticipated,"" said Piotr Matys, currency strategist at Rabobank.
In the event of a continued sell-off -- aside from the Argentine peso and Turkish lira -- South Africa's rand and Brazil's real are most at risk, according to a majority of analysts who answered an additional question.
The rand has been resilient most of this year, and during other bouts of selling, compared to other emerging market currencies.
Data triggered more weakness for the rand on Tuesday, however, when the statistics agency confirmed South Africa entered recession in the second quarter for the first time since 2009, a bad start for new President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Last month's Reuters poll indicated emerging-market currencies were unlikely to rebound from this year's downturn until 2019 and that the search for yield was unlikely to be considered a driving factor for currency trades until then.
Analysts said the likelihood the European Central Bank will start to raise rates next year would tilt interest-rate-differential support away from the dollar, triggering a more meaningful pull back for emerging markets.
The storm in emerging markets continued to rage fiercely this week, with the rand in the eye and suffering around a 3 percent fall on Tuesday. Losses since late January for MSCI's 24-country EM stocks index are nearing $1 trillion. [EMRG/FRX]
The rand clawed back some of its losses on Thursday after data showed South Africa's current account deficit had narrowed to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in the second quarter.
""The main focus, I still believe, remains on the global backdrop, on trade tensions between the U.S. and China, on the Fed, and (the) crisis in other emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey,"" said Matys.
Argentina's government said on Tuesday it hoped the International Monetary Fund would agree later this month to a deal giving the country more financial support as it seeks to escape a deepening economic crisis.
On Monday, President Mauricio Macri announced new taxes on exports and steep spending cuts to eliminate Argentina's primary fiscal deficit next year. The measures are aimed at assuring investors Argentina can pay its debts.
""The issue with Argentina is a crisis of confidence. When you are dealing with such a crisis it is extremely difficult to regain confidence amongst investors,"" Matys said.
Meanwhile in Turkey, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings agencies cut Turkey's sovereign credit ratings deeper into ""junk"" territory last month, a development that would have likely worried investors in the broader emerging markets.
The lira is likely to slide further in a year to 6.82 per dollar from 6.50, the poll showed.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 10:46AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims drop to near 49-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment aid fell to near a 49-year low last week and private payrolls rose steadily in August, pointing to sustained labor market strength that should continue to underpin economic growth.
The economy so far appears to be weathering an escalating trade war between the United States and China as well as tensions with other trade partners, including Canada, the European Union and Mexico, which have rattled financial markets. 
This likely keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates this month for the third time this year.
""The economy is in overdrive with jobless claims at lows not seen since the 1960s, and this gives the Fed the green light to raise interest rates later this month and take away some of the economy's punch,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Labor Department said on Thursday initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 203,000 for the week ended Sept. 1, the lowest level since December 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 214,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 last week to 209,500, also the lowest level since December 1969.
Though there have been reports of some companies either planning job cuts or laying off workers because of uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, that has not yet been reflected in the claims data. 
Economists say given labor market tightness, employers were reluctant to lay off workers. The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment.
U.S. stocks were trading mixed after the data while prices of U.S. Treasuries were slightly higher. The dollar was lower against a basket of currencies.
STRONG JOB GROWTH
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 163,000 jobs last month. Data for July was revised to show private hiring rising by 217,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 219,000 positions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls increasing by 190,000 jobs last month. The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for August, which is due on Friday.
Though the ADP report has a spotty record predicting the private payrolls component of the employment report, economists said the August data hinted at some slowing in job growth.
""Employment growth is still well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants into the labor force, meaning that the unemployment rate, which is already unusually low, should continue to decline gradually,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 191,000 jobs in August, which would be an acceleration from the 157,000 jobs created in July. The unemployment rate is forecast slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent, revisiting an 18-year low touched in May. 
Should the August employment report meet market expectations on Friday, that would likely seal the case for a rate increase at the Fed's Sept. 25-26 policy meeting. 
The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years. Consumer and business spending data in July have suggested solid economic growth early in the third quarter. But there are concerns the trade tensions could hurt confidence and undercut spending.
The economy's vibrancy was underscored by a report on Thursday from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showing its non-manufacturing activity index increased 2.8 points to 58.5 last month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The ISM survey said respondents to its survey remained positive about business conditions and the economy, but cautioned that ""logistics, tariffs and employment resources continue to have an impact on many of the respective industries.""
While a fourth report from the Commerce Department showed factory goods orders dropped 0.8 percent in July amid weak demand for aircraft, business spending appeared to be picking up early in the third quarter. Orders rose 0.6 percent in June.
July orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, jumped 1.6 percent instead of increasing 1.4 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 0.8 percent in June.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.0 percent in July instead of climbing 0.9 percent as reported last month. 
Core capital goods shipments rose 1.0 percent in June. Business spending on equipment slowed in the second quarter after growing robustly since the first quarter of 2017.

A fifth report from the Labor Department showed nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an unrevised 2.9 percent annualized rate in the April-June quarter. That was the strongest pace since the first quarter of 2015. Productivity grew at a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter.

Factory goods orders dropped 0.8 percent, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for June was revised slightly down to show factory orders rising 0.6 percent instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent increase. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders falling 0.6 percent in July. Orders increased 8.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in July.
Despite the drop in factory orders in July, manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, remains strong. An Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturers published on Tuesday showed factory activity accelerated to more than a 14-year high in August.
But there are concerns an escalating trade war between United States and China could hurt business confidence and undercut capital spending. A strong dollar and worker shortages are also seen slowing momentum in the manufacturing sector.
In July, orders for transportation equipment fell 5.2 percent, dragged down by a 35.4 percent plunge in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft and parts. Orders for defense aircraft and parts tumbled 34.4 percent in July. Transportation orders rose 2.0 percent in June. 
Orders for motor vehicles increased 1.3 percent in July. There were increases in orders for machinery, primary metals and computers and electronic products. Orders for fabricated metal products fell as did those for electronic equipment, appliances and components.

Productivity grew at a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast second-quarter productivity being raised to a 3.0 percent rate, in line with a modest upward revision to gross domestic product growth for that period. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the April-June period, almost double the 2.2 percent pace logged in the first quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of 2017, productivity increased at an unrevised rate of 1.3 percent. That suggests the second-quarter GDP growth pace is probably unsustainable.
Productivity grew at an average rate of 1.3 percent between 2007 and 2017. That was slower than the 2.7 percent average pace between 2000 and 2007. 

Strong productivity in the second quarter weighed on growth in labor costs. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, fell at a 1.0 percent pace in the second quarter, rather than the 0.9 percent rate estimated last month.
That was the weakest pace since the third quarter of 2014. Unit labor costs grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the first quarter. Labor costs increased at an unrevised 1.9 percent rate compared to the second quarter of 2017, pointing to moderate wage inflation.

The reading undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a rise of 1.8 percent.
The Ifo economic institute said, however, that Germany's economic upswing will continue as a strong domestic economy is providing a buffer against external shocks.
""We are currently facing a strong economic upswing in Germany,"" Ifo economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said. ""It will be largely driven by private consumption this year and next, helped by rising employment and strong income growth.""
The Ifo institute raised its 2018 growth forecast for Germany to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent previously, citing a better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year.
It forecasts gross domestic product growth rates of 1.9 percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020.
The DIW economic institute and the IWH research group said separately that they predicted German growth of 1.8 percent in 2018 and 1.7 percent in 2019.
""There are no signs of an economic slump,"" DIW chief economist Claus Michelsen said.
""However, companies are investing only hesitatingly for the time being, among other things because their sales outlook is clouded by trade conflicts,"" he added.
TIT-FOR-TAT
Trump has triggered trade disputes with China, Europe and many others regions by imposing steep tariffs on a broad range of products in his pledge to protect American jobs against what he calls unfair trade practices.
Global markets are on edge after Trump threatened fresh tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports and China's commerce ministry said it would be forced to retaliate.
Industrial orders from abroad dropped by 3.4 percent in July, with demand from clients outside the euro zone plunging the most, the data showed. Domestic orders rose by 2.4 percent.
A sector breakdown of the figures showed that orders for capital goods came in particularly weak. Demand for consumer goods edged down while orders for intermediate goods rose.
The Economy Ministry pointed to trade-related uncertainties as the main reason for orders falling in six of the past seven months.
""Order intake in the manufacturing sector has slowed noticeably since the beginning of the year after a very dynamic second half of 2017,"" the ministry said.
""The worldwide uncertainty caused by trade conflicts probably played a role here,"" it added.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analyst Andreas Rees also pointed to special effects such as holidays and slower production in the car industry due to changes in emissions regulation.
The appreciation of the euro has also led to a slide in competitiveness of German producers by making their goods more expensive for customers outside the single currency bloc, the IHW said.

The orders data followed a survey among purchasing managers, published on Wednesday, that showed German services growth reached a six-month high in August as firms created jobs at the fastest pace in nearly 11 years.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 02:21PM ET</span>",Canadian tariffs hit imports of some U.S. goods in July,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's retaliatory tariffs sent imports of some U.S. goods sharply lower in July after a June surge, Statistics Canada data showed on Wednesday, offering a first look at the impact of the Canadian duties.
On July 1, Canada imposed tariffs on a wide variety of U.S. steel, aluminum and other goods, from soy sauce to sleeping bags, in retaliation against U.S. President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.
The tariffs effectively shut down imports of U.S. maple syrup, which dropped 97 percent between June and July, to only C$112,881 ($85,567.77), the data showed.
Canada dominates the global maple syrup trade, but in recent years, with many Canadian producers bound by a quota system and demand growing, imports from Maine have increased.
Imports of steel goods subject to a 25 percent tariff dropped 39.6 percent to C$368.6 million between June and July, after rising 32.7 percent in June. Imports of aluminum products targeted with a 10 percent duty dipped 5.2 percent in July.
Imports of all other targeted goods fell 22.8 percent to C$634.8 million in the month, after rising 14.0 percent in June. 
Overall, the trade deficit narrowed to C$114 million ($87 million) from C$743 million in June, as exports rose 0.8 percent. It was the narrowest deficit since a surplus was posted in December 2016.
The rise in exports was led by energy products as crude oil exports climbed for a fifth straight month. Oil exports were helped by a 9.4 percent rise in prices.
In volume terms, exports fell 0.8 percent.
Imports slipped 0.4 percent, weighed by declines in aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts as well as metal ores and non-metallic minerals. 
Exports to the United States rose 3.3 percent while imports dipped 0.1 percent. As a result, the trade surplus with the United States widened to C$5.3 billion from C$4.1 billion in June.

On a year-over-year basis, exports rose 16.3 percent and imports climbed 10.1 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit rose to a five-month high in July, with the politically sensitive gap with China hitting a record high, which economists said could embolden the Trump administration to aggressively pursue its ""America First"" agenda.
The administration's protectionist trade policy has left the United States embroiled in tit-for-tat tariffs with the European Union, Canada and Mexico as well as an escalating trade war with China. President Donald Trump claims the United States is being taken advantage of by its trade partners.
The deterioration in the trade deficit reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday came a day before the end of a public comment period on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese goods widely expected to be hit with tariffs soon.
""America still isn't getting a fair deal on trade and that can only mean one thing,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""President Trump is going unleash another $200 billion in tariffs on China imports."" 
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit increased 9.5 percent to $50.1 billion as exports of soybeans and civilian aircraft dropped and imports hit a record high. The trade gap has now widened for two straight months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall swelling to $50.3 billion in July. 
The government imposed import duties on goods including steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels early this year to protect American industries from what Trump says is unfair foreign competition. In addition, the United States and China have slapped retaliatory tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July. 
Washington is also seeking to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement. The United States struck a deal with Mexico last week, but negotiations with Canada have been contentious. 
The administration says eliminating the trade deficit will put the economy on a sustainable path of faster growth. But economists say some of the government's policies such as a $1.5 trillion tax cut package early this year will worsen the trade deficit. The fiscal stimulus has boosted consumer and business spending, drawing in more imports.
""The U.S. cannot enjoy an investment spending boom without installing a significant amount of capital equipment and ... this means a surge in capital goods imports,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The trade gap narrowed in April and May as farmers front-loaded soybean exports to China before Beijing's retaliatory tariffs came into effect in early July. The deterioration in the trade deficit in July was flagged in an advance report published last month.
U.S. stocks were trading lower on fears Trump would soon ramp up the trade war with China. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
RECORD HIGH IMPORTS
When adjusted for inflation, the trade gap increased to a five-month high of $82.5 billion in July from $79.3 billion in June. July's so-called real trade deficit is above the second-quarter average of $77.5 billion. 
If that trend continues in August and September, trade could subtract from third-quarter gross domestic product growth. Trade contributed 1.17 percentage points to the economy's 4.2 percent annualized growth pace in the second quarter, which was almost double the 2.2 percent rate notched in the January-March period.
The goods trade deficit with China surged 10 percent to a record $36.8 billion in July. The trade gap with Mexico narrowed 25.3 percent to $5.5 billion while the shortfall with Canada shot up 57.6 percent to $3.1 billion. 
The trade deficit with the European Union soared 50 percent to a record high of $17.6 billion.
In July, exports of goods and services fell 1.0 percent to $211.1 billion. Soybean exports dropped $0.7 billion and shipments of civilian aircraft decreased $1.6 billion. Petroleum exports, however, were the highest on record.
With the dollar strengthening in recent months against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners and global economic growth slowing, exports could remain on the back foot.
Imports of goods and services increased 0.9 percent to a record $261.2 billion in July. They were boosted by imports of computers and computer accessories. The import bill was also inflated by petroleum imports, which were the highest since December 2014 amid higher oil prices.
The price of imported crude oil averaged $64.63 per barrel in July, the highest since December 2014 and up from $62.42 in June. There were also increases in imports of automobiles and parts as well as other goods. Pharmaceutical preparations imports, however, fell $1.3 billion.

""Looking ahead, cooler global momentum and the stronger dollar will temper export growth while imports will stay well-supported by upbeat domestic demand, fiscal stimulus and the strong greenback,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 10:22AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada keeps rates on hold, says more hikes warranted","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady on Wednesday as expected and reiterated that while more hikes would be needed to keep inflation on target, it would take a gradual approach.
The overnight interest rate remains at 1.50 percent. The central bank - which maintains a 2 percent target for inflation - has raised rates four times since July 2017 in response to a recovering economy.
""Recent data reinforce Governing Council's assessment that higher interest rates will be warranted to achieve the inflation target. We will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data,"" the bank said in a statement, using language that was little changed from the last announcement on July 11.
A Reuters poll of economists published last Friday had predicted the bank was likely to leave interest rates unchanged. The bank's next fixed date for unveiling its rate decision is Oct. 24.
Although Canada's annual inflation rate surged to 3.0 percent in July, its highest level in nearly seven years, the bank said it expected the rate would move back towards 2 percent in early 2019 as the effects of past increases in gasoline prices dissipated.
""The Bank's core measures of inflation remain firmly around 2 percent, consistent with an economy that has been operating near capacity for some time,"" it said.
Data released last week showed gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.9 percent in the second quarter, ahead of the bank's estimate of 2.8 percent.
The bank said it expected GDP to slow temporarily in the third quarter, thanks largely to further fluctuations in energy production and exports.
Elevated trade tensions remained a key risk to the global outlook, it added.

Canadian and U.S. officials are due to meet on Wednesday in a bid to settle disagreements holding up the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

1116,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 10:12AM ET</span>",Bank of Canada Holds on Interest Rates as it Monitors NAFTA Developments,"Investing.com – The Bank of Canada (BoC) decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, while continuing to observe developments in the renegotiation between the U.S. and Canada of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
As expected, the BoC said it was holding its overnight cash rate steady at 1.50%.
The policy statement noted that recent data has been positive despite the fact that “uncertainty about trade policies continues to weigh on businesses”.
The BoC expected growth to “slow temporarily” from the latest reading of 2.9% in the third quarter due to further fluctuations in energy production and exports.
Regardless, the central bank’s overall assessment was that higher interest rates will be warranted to achieve the inflation target.
“We will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data,” the statement said.
The central bank last increased rates by a quarter-point in July in what was its fourth hike since mid-2017.
Economists predict that the BoC will continue with gradual tightening as it remains cautious over trade talks between the U.S. and Canada and predict the next hike will come at the October meeting.
Besides gauging the economic reaction to higher interest rates, the BoC concluded that it is “also monitoring closely the course of NAFTA negotiations and other trade policy developments, and their impact on the inflation outlook.”
U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a deadline of last Friday in order to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada but no deal was reached with both parties resuming talks in Washington on Wednesday.
NAFTA is key for Canada as roughly 75% of its total exports are to the U.S., equivalent to about 20% of Canadian gross domestic product.
The Bank of International Settlements estimated last week that a complete breakdown of NAFTA would cause a 2.2% decline in Canada’s GDP."

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity picked up a bit last month, extending a period of solid growth, but a growing global trade war kept optimism in check and suggests the pace may not be maintained, a survey showed.
Signs of robust growth and inflationary pressures means the European Central Bank is unlikely to be swayed from closing its 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program by year-end.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, nudged up in August to 54.5 from July's 54.3, just above an earlier flash estimate of 54.4. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
August's surveys point to quarterly euro zone economic growth of 0.4 percent, matching a forecast in a Reuters poll last month, IHS Markit said. But it also questioned whether the pace could be maintained next quarter. 
""The composite PMIs were pretty encouraging,"" said Jack Allen at Capital Economics.
""The trade war has had some effect. The policies that have been implemented so far by the U.S. hitting the euro zone are pretty small, but worries about protectionism escalating in the future could have had an impact on businesses.""
An index measuring optimism sank to a near two-year low of 61.6 from 63.1. Purchasing managers were spooked about the impact of trade wars, IHS Markit said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is ready to implement new tariffs on Chinese imports as soon as Thursday, which would be a major escalation after Washington earlier applied tariffs on $50 billion of exports from China.
Markets were little moved after the PMI surveys, instead focusing attention on the looming deadline which kept the dollar near two-week highs on Wednesday, inflicting fresh losses on emerging markets and sending world stocks lower for the fourth day in a row.
DOMESTIC HELP
With the trade war intensifying, German services growth was supported by a domestically-driven upswing in Europe's largest economy, reaching a six-month high, and French activity also picked up, earlier surveys showed.
In Britain, outside the currency bloc and set to leave the European Union next year, its large services sector picked up more strongly than expected last month, bucking a slowdown for manufacturers and construction firms. 
But Brexit worries are dampening investment plans and confidence for the year ahead.
Britain's economy has slowed since the June 2016 Brexit vote, its growth rate slipping from top spot among the Group of Seven group of rich nations to jostling with long-term laggards Japan and Italy for bottom place in the growth rankings.
Italy's services sector slowed for a second month running in August, according to an earlier PMI.
""The Italian indices were a bit more interesting and a bit more worrying. The big picture is that Italy seems likely to remain a laggard in the euro zone, leaving it vulnerable to further economic shocks and possible sell-offs in the market,"" Allen said.
Most recent data in the euro zone's third-largest economy have pointed to a slowdown, posing a challenge for the anti-establishment government of the 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League, which took office in June.
A PMI covering the euro zone's dominant service industry rose to 54.4 from 54.2, in line with a preliminary reading but well shy of readings witnessed around the start of the year.
Still, forward-looking indicators were also more positive last month, with new business and backlogs of work accelerating. An index measuring employment -- which is a lagging indicator -- rose to 55.3 from 54.6, its highest since October 2007.

However, euro zone retail sales grew at a more moderate rate than expected year-on-year in July, mirroring a steady weakening of consumer sentiment since the start of the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy is holding its solid pace of growth, according to a survey which showed the large services sector expanded more strongly than expected in August, but Brexit worries are hitting investment plans and confidence.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) increased to 54.3 in August from 53.5 in July, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and rising further above the 50-mark that indicates growth.
The PMI pointed to a repeat of the overall economy's 0.4 percent quarterly growth rate recorded in the three months to June, IHS Markit said, despite weaker than expected manufacturing and construction PMIs earlier this week.
Separate PMIs suggested the euro zone economy was on course to grow at the same pace in the third quarter.
""(This is) a relatively robust and resilient rate of expansion that will no doubt draw some sighs of relief at the Bank of England after the rate hike earlier in the month,"" IHS Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said.
Sterling edged up on Wednesday after the survey was published, but is down more than 10 percent against the U.S. dollar since April when concerns about the potential for an economically damaging Brexit began to build.
Howard Archer, an economist with consultants EY ITEM Club, said the mixed set of August PMIs showed why investors were not expecting the BoE to raise borrowing costs further any time soon, after August's quarter-point increase to 0.75 percent.
""It looks unlikely that interest rates will rise again until after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 given the major uncertainties that are likely to occur in the run-up to the UK’s departure,"" Archer said.
Britain's economy has slowed since the June 2016 Brexit vote, its growth rate slipping from top spot among the Group of Seven group of rich nations to jostling with long-term laggards Japan and Italy for bottom place in the rankings.
Nonetheless, last month the Bank of England raised interest rates for only the second time in a decade, due to concerns that labor shortages and other capacity constraints will prevent inflation returning to its 2 percent target in the short term.
Employment intentions in the services sector rose to a six-month high, but confidence for the year ahead slipped to its lowest since March, as businesses said Brexit uncertainty had made clients less willing to invest, for now.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to agree the terms of Britain's future relationship with the European Union, less than seven months before the country leaves the bloc.
Financial services accounted for much of the growth, and businesses reported softer demand from retailers, who are not directly covered by the services PMI.
Many consumers are feeling the strain of inflation that has been growing faster than their wages for much of the past decade.
""Given the increasingly unbalanced nature of growth and the darkening business mood, risks to the immediate outlook seem tilted to the downside,"" Williamson said.
Firms in the PMI survey reported paying higher salaries to recruit hard-to-find staff and reduce employee turnover that was limiting their ability to complete some projects.

Official data showed record vacancies and unemployment at a 43-year low in July, but this has not translated into widespread pay rises for the workforce as a whole.

Research firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.3 in August from 53.5 in July, compared to forecasts for a reading of 53.9.
The reading bolstered the outlook for third quarter growth after disappointing data from similar surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors earlier in the week, according to Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson.
“The survey data indicate that the economy is on course to expand by 0.4% in the third quarter, a relatively robust and resilient rate of expansion that will no doubt draw some sighs of relief at the Bank of England after the rate hike earlier in the month,” said Williamson.
Companies reported that business activity was boosted by an increase in new work.
The report noted that “a lack of suitably skilled candidates to fill vacancies had held back staff hiring”, but the shortage of skilled staff contributed to higher salary payments last month.
However, business optimism about the year ahead fell to the lowest level since March, amid “political uncertainty and the unpredictable impact of Brexit on clients’ business operations.”
“Business expectations for the year ahead meanwhile sank markedly lower, down across all three sectors to one of the lowest levels seen since the EU referendum, largely reflecting increased anxiety over Brexit negotiations,"" Williamson said.
“Given the increasingly unbalanced nature of growth and the darkening business mood, risks to the immediate outlook seem tilted to the downside.”"
1120,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Australia's Economy Expands at the Fastest Pace in Six Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy grew faster than expected last quarter as households ran down savings to finance their spending -- shrugging off falling house prices and weak wage growth.
Gross domestic product advanced 0.9 percent from the first quarter, when it rose an upwardly revised 1.1 percent, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Wednesday. The economy expanded 3.4 percent in the three months through June from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2012.
“The Reserve Bank has been expecting the economy to perform well,” suggesting the data is unlikely to rush the bank into an interest-rate increase, said Paul Dales, chief economist for Australia at Capital Economics. “But the markets may start to reconsider their view that interest rates won’t rise until sometime in 2020.”
The report spans a period when hiring remained solid and unemployment fell, supporting consumption despite households struggling with a heavy debt burden and weak wages. Government spending helped offset softer business investment in the period and the economy enjoyed a prolonged tailwind from revived exports following disruptions.
The Australian dollar climbed, buying 72.13 U.S. cents at 12:28 p.m. in Sydney, compared with 71.89 prior to the release.
The quarterly growth was supported by a 0.7 percent increase in household spending, adding 0.4 percentage point to GDP, as the savings ratio dropped to 1 percent from a downward revised 1.6 percent in the first three months, the report showed.
“Our big concern is that at some point households will falter in the face of low income growth, falling house prices, tightening credit conditions and rising mortgage rates,” Dales said, adding there’s a risk consumers “may have overextended themselves.”
‘Right Direction’
The central bank will welcome the data, having kept the benchmark interest rate at a record-low to help achieve above-average growth. Treasury estimates the economy’s annual speed limit is about 2.75 percent and expansion above that starts to utilize spare capacity. Such an outcome is a precursor to faster wage gains and higher inflation, a process Governor Philip Lowe acknowledges will only be gradual.
“The Australian economy is moving in the right direction,” Lowe said in Perth Tuesday evening, having earlier kept rates unchanged at 1.5 percent for a 23rd meeting. “We are seeking to be a source of stability and confidence, as further progress is made towards full employment and having inflation return to around the midpoint of the target range.”
Traders are pricing in little chance of a rate hike before 2020 as international experience suggests that even as economies reach full employment -- a level Australia remains shy of -- they still struggle to generate higher pay and faster inflation.
Furthermore, Australia is the developed world’s most China-dependent economy and the prospect of a deepening trade war has the potential to reverberate Down Under. Still, today’s data showed exports rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter, adding 0.2 point to growth.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy sped past all expectations last quarter as rapid population growth fueled demand for homes and infrastructure, while bolstering consumer spending in the face of painfully slow wages growth.
The rousing result marked the 27th year without recession, a remarkable feat given an ever-changing procession of prime ministers and one that owes much to China's insatiable appetite for Australia's resource riches.
Wednesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the economy grew 0.9 percent in the June quarter, from the March quarter when it expanded by a rapid 1.1 percent.
Gross domestic product (GDP) was 3.4 percent higher than a year earlier, ahead even of the 2.9 percent growth boasted by the United States.It was the strongest result in almost six years and handily beat market forecasts of 2.8 percent thanks to upward revisions of previous quarters.
Investors reacted by driving up the local dollar up a quarter of U.S. cent to $0.7215 (AUD=D3>.
""It's a pretty good print for the quarter and with the upward revisions,"" said Su-Lin Ong, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets. 
""The composition is encouraging as well. We've seen pretty decent domestic demand and reasonably broad-based growth.""
The ruling Liberal-National coalition will be hoping the news distracts voters from the endless internecine warfare that saw Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ousted last month and replaced with former Treasurer Scott Morrison.
This was the fifth change of prime minister in eight years and sent the government crashing in opinion polls. An election is due by May next year but risks are for an earlier vote.
Analysts fear the political dysfunction could take a toll on consumer sentiment, just as spending seemed to be making a comeback. Household consumption had rebounded in the June quarter to add 0.4 percentage points to GDP.
Also adding to growth were net exports, home building and government spending. 
MAKING MORE AUSTRALIANS
For the whole year to June, GDP amounted to A$1.84 trillion ($1.33 trillion) in current dollars, or about A$74,000 for each of Australia's 25 million residents.
Fuelling that performance was annual population growth of 1.6 percent, more than double the developed-world average, as Australia attracted more migrants from China and India.
Having more people has helped offset weakness in productivity that has bedeviled much of the rich world in recent years. That offset was evident in GDP per capita which grew only 1.8 percent in the year to June.
Plenty of headwinds still loom, including a drought that has scorched the Pacific nation's eastern farm belt.
After a decade of feverish expansion, home prices are now falling across the country - a sizable drag on consumer wealth given the housing stock is valued at A$6.9 trillion.
A recent hike in mortgage rates by Westpac (AX:WBC) stirred fears the other major banks would follow and pile further pressure on the housing market.
So far, policy makers are unperturbed. Speaking in Perth on Tuesday, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe noted the average mortgage rate was still lower than a year ago and urged borrowers to shop around for better deals.
The central bank has kept interest rates at an all-time low of 1.5 percent since mid-2016 and concedes they will have to remain there for some time yet.

Lowe was concerned at developments abroad, notably the Sino-U.S. trade dispute and the rise of protectionism. Two-way trade accounts for 44 percent of Australia's GDP, while China alone takes around a third of the country's exports.

The downturn in the key part of the economy comes at a trying time for Beijing, which is facing an escalating trade war with the United States that threatens the country's massive manufacturing sector at a time of a deepening domestic slowdown. 
For August, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.5, the lowest in 10 months, from July's 52.8. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
Government officials have long touted a strong expansion in services as evidence of the economy rebalancing to more sustainable growth, though weaker consumer spending and a housing slowdown may be putting a dent in overall output.
Labour-intensive services industries are taking on a more crucial for generating jobs as factories become more automated and rising costs in China push more manufacturers offshore.
The threat of fresh tariffs from Washington could also add to pressure on factory jobs, as President Donald Trump's administration is set to decide on imposing duties on another $200 billion of Chinese imports as early as this week.
Caixin's weaker reading on the services sector followed a separate survey on Monday showing China's manufacturing activity grew at the slowest pace in more than a year in August, with export orders shrinking for a fifth month and employers cutting more staff.
There were signs of rising upstream cost pressures in the services industry, Wednesday's survey showed, as input prices rose significantly faster that prices charged. Both were up from July. 
Confidence in future business picked up from July's near-record low, but remained well below the series average, the survey showed. Growth in new business, which in July slowed to the weakest since December 2015, picked up only slightly last month. 
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors also declined in August, coming in at 52.0 compared with the previous month's 52.3. 
The composite index indicates ""that economic growth remained on a downward trajectory. Inflationary pressures were pronounced as increases in both input prices and output prices accelerated,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, in a statement accompanying the survey.
With growth softening across China's economy, policymakers have stepped in to try to cushion the slowdown by pledging more infrastructure spending and an increase in lending. 

""August’s PMI readings indicated that the effects of expansionary credit policy and active fiscal policy are yet to kick in. Signs of stagnation emerged as upward pressure on prices remained even though demand weakened at a faster rate.""

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) increased to 51.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 51.3 in July.
The index has remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for 23 consecutive months.
In August, new business expanded at the fastest pace in four months and companies added workers at the highest rate in 14 months, suggesting the economy remains healthy.
Factory activity also picked up in August, according to earlier Markit/Nikkei survey, but economists warn that trade protectionism is a risk to Japan's export-oriented economy.
""Survey data continues to point to fairly robust conditions for the service sector to continue along its expansionary path nonetheless,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 52.0 in August from 51.8 the previous month.
Recent data on consumer spending, a big driver of the services sector, has been mixed.
Real wages rose in June at the fastest rate in more than 21 years due to higher summer bonuses, but household spending and retail sales data have disappointed.

There is a good chance consumer spending will continue to grow, but economists worry that trade protectionism could harm sentiment at companies and in households.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated to more than a 14-year high in August, boosted by a surge in new orders, but increasing bottlenecks in the supply chain because of a robust economy and import tariffs could restrain further growth.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey was at odds with another survey published on Tuesday that suggested a peak in manufacturing and pointed to a slowdown in the months ahead against the backdrop of a strong dollar. Recent surveys have also signaled a cooling in regional factory activity.
""The surge in the ISM manufacturing index is difficult to square with other evidence, which indicate that growth in the factory sector has started to slow,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
""With export orders now waning as a result of the dollar's rapid appreciation over the past few months, we still think that growth in the factory sector will slow in the coming quarters.
The ISM said its index of national factory activity jumped to 61.3 last month, the best reading since May 2004, from 58.1 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The ISM described demand as remaining ""robust,"" but cautioned that ""the nation's employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle."" According to the ISM, survey respondents were ""again overwhelmingly concerned about tariff-related activity, including how reciprocal tariffs will impact company revenue and current manufacturing locations.""
President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy has led to an escalating trade war with China and tit-for-tat import tariffs with other trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico. 
Trump has defended the duties on steel and aluminum imports and a range of Chinese goods as necessary to protect American industries from what he says is unfair foreign competition.
Economists have warned that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains, undercut business investment and slow the economy's momentum. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, almost double the 2.2 percent in the January-March period.
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
IMPACT OF TARIFFS
The ISM's new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 65.1 last month from 60.2 in July. A measure of export orders, however, fell in August, likely reflecting the dollar's more than 5.0 percent rise this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners. 
The survey's supplier deliveries index jumped to a reading of 64.5 last month, highlighting the rising bottlenecks in the supply chain, from 62.1 in July. It hit a 14-year high of 68.2 in June. Economists said the strong economy, marked by a labor market that is near or at full employment, as well as the import duties were behind the delays in deliveries.
""Bottlenecks in production will support inflation, but the constraints have yet to become overly binding,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Factories reported hiring more workers last month, with production increasing sharply. That bodes well for August's employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday. Manufacturing payrolls have increased solidly this year.
In the computer and electronic products industry, manufacturers said most suppliers were ""waiting to re-evaluate potential price increases until September."" 
Machinery manufacturers said while raw material costs appeared to be ""leveling off,"" and most suppliers ""are willing and able to suppress cost increases,"" the impact of tariffs remained a concern.
In a separate survey on Tuesday, data firm Markit said its U.S. manufacturing PMI fell to a nine-month low of 54.7 in August from a reading of 55.3 in July. Manufacturers reported a decline in new orders, with exports the main source of weakness.
Markit said some of the slowdown in factory activity reflected widespread shortages of inputs, hauliers and labor, leading to a further build-up of backlogs of work. 
It said tariffs were exacerbating supply shortages and also driving prices higher. Almost two-thirds of companies surveyed reporting higher input prices explicitly blamed tariffs for the increased costs, Markit said. 
""When we look across the recent survey data, it appears that activity has cooled somewhat lately, but remains at a solid level,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan in New York.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending barely rose in July as increases in homebuilding and investment in public projects were overshadowed by a sharp drop in private nonresidential outlays.

""This is a surprising month for August. You could expect September to be a strong month,"" Fiore said on a conference call with reporters after ISM released its August factory activity data.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending edged up 0.1 percent. Data for June was revised up to show construction outlays declining 0.8 percent instead of the previously reported 1.1 percent drop.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending increasing 0.5 percent in July. Construction spending increased 5.8 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Spending on private residential projects rebounded 0.6 percent in July following two straight months of declines.
While homebuilding rose in July, the overall trend has slowed, with builders continuing to complain about rising material costs as well as persistent land and labor shortages. Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, dropped 1.0 percent in July. That was the biggest decline since August 2017 and followed a 0.1 percent gain in June. 
Overall, spending on private construction projects slipped 0.1 percent in July after decreasing 0.5 percent in June.
Investment in public construction projects increased 0.7 percent after tumbling 1.7 percent in June. Spending on federal government construction projects rebounded 2.5 percent. That followed a 3.0 percent drop in June.

State and local government construction outlays advanced 0.6 percent in July after falling 1.6 percent in the prior month.

Key Takeaways
The report shows factories remained solid in the third quarter and adds to signals that the nearly decade-old expansion will hold up well in the second half of 2018. The rise in the employment gauge also suggests manufacturers may record another month of strong payroll gains in Labor Department figures due Friday.
The gauges of exports and imports also may indicate that months of intensifying tensions are taking a toll on trade. Negotiations with Canada to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement ended without a deal by Friday's deadline, though talks are scheduled to resume Wednesday.

1128,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Manufacturing Growth Picks Up to Second-Fastest Pace Ever,"Investing.com - The rate of growth in the economy's manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up in August, hitting its highest level since May 2004 and marking the second-strongest reading in the history of the data.
The Institute of Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 61.3 in August, from 58.1 the previous month.
Economists had forecast a reading of 57.6.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector, and a reading below 50 signals contraction.
The new orders index rose to 65.1 in August from 60.2 a month earlier.
The employment index increased to 58.5 last month from the prior 56.5. Economists had predicted a drop to 56.0.
“Demand remains strong, with the New Orders Index at 60% or above for the 16th straight month, and the Customers’ Inventories Index remaining low,” Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM business survey committee, said in the report.
Although demand is robust, Fiore signaled that the nation’s employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle.
“Respondents are again overwhelmingly concerned about tariff-related activity, including how reciprocal tariffs will impact company revenue and current manufacturing locations,” he said.
“Panelists are actively evaluating how to respond to these business changes, given the uncertainty,” Fiore concluded."

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, dipped to a seasonally adjusted 56.8 last month from 56.9 in July. It reached a survey-record high of 57.1 in June.
A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""Canadian manufacturers continued to boost their production volumes in August,"" said Christian Buhagiar, president and CEO, Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA). ""A slowdown in new business growth meant that the headline PMI dipped to a three-month low.""
The output index climbed to its highest since December 2010 at 57.2, from 56.4 in July. Manufacturers pointed to rising customer demand and increased operating capacity at their plants, IHS Markit said.
The new orders index fell to 55.7, a four-month low, from 57.2 in July amid evidence that heightened business uncertainty and global trade tensions were holding back spending decisions.
Increased demand in the energy sector helped boost export sales but there were reports that U.S. trade tariffs had dented competitiveness in the period, IHS Markit said. 
U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum went into effect on June 1.
""The latest survey highlighted that steel and aluminum tariffs pushed up input costs and acted as a headwind to export sales in U.S. markets,"" Buhagiar said.

The output prices index dipped to 61.3 from a survey-record high of 62.8 in July, while the input prices index rose to its highest in more than seven years at 73.7 from 71.6.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",UK companies spend least on foreign takeovers since 2013,"LONDON (Reuters) - British companies' spending on takeovers of foreign businesses fell to its lowest in nearly five years during the three months to June, as Brexit worries appeared to weigh on firms' appetite to make big investments, official figures showed on Tuesday.
British-based businesses spent 1.92 billion pounds ($2.46 billion) on acquiring foreign companies, the smallest amount since the third quarter of 2013 and down sharply from a 17-year high of 51.77 billion pounds in the third quarter of 2017.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) highlighted that in May the Bank of England said firms' investment intentions were modest during the second quarter of 2018, due partly to concerns about Britain's departure from the European Union in 2019.
Merger and acquisition activity in 2017 was unusually high, and included British American Tobacco's purchase of U.S. cigarette-maker Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) in the third quarter.
The value of foreign takeovers of British companies dropped to 6.50 billion pounds from 22.32 billion pounds in the previous quarter, when foreign purchases of gambling group  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) Coral and payments company Worldpay were completed.
A weaker pound - which has declined in value since the Brexit referendum decision in June 2016 - makes British companies cheaper for foreign buyers and increases the cost of overseas takeovers for British firms. 
Nonetheless, the latest figures are well below the average seen since the financial crisis.
Quarterly data on the value of takeovers is often volatile and often lags actual activity as it is calculated when transactions complete. 
The fall in the scale of mergers and acquisitions came despite a sharp rise in the absolute number of takeovers recorded, which the ONS attributed to improved data collection methods rather than an underlying change.

Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.4 percent month-on-month in July against market expectations of a 0.3 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
Year-on-year, producer prices rose 4.0 percent in July, against market expectations of a 3.9 percent gain.
Energy prices rose 1.1 percent on the month and were 10.7 percent higher than a year earlier, making energy the biggest variable in the overall index. 
Without volatile energy, producer prices rose only 0.1 percent month-on-month and 1.7 percent year-on-year, confirming the view of European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that spiking energy prices are the main reason for higher inflation.
Prices at factory gates herald trends in consumer inflation because unless absorbed by intermediaries or retailers, higher producer costs translate directly into higher consumer prices.

The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term. An early Eurostat estimate showed last week that in August, consumer inflation was 2.0 percent year-on-year.

Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.9 in August, compared to forecasts for a reading of 54.9.
The prior month’s reading was 55.8.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit indicated that there was a modest overall rise in construction activity in August, although output growth eased to a three-month low.
The research firm highlighted that suppliers’ delivery times lengthened to the greatest extent since March 2015, while input cost inflation eased to a 25-month low.
“There are some encouraging takeaways from the latest survey, especially the resilient degree of new business growth in August and a strong upturn in staff recruitment,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
He noted that survey respondents were confident about achieving organic growth at their businesses in the next 12 months.
“The degree of optimism reported in August remained constrained by external factors, including domestic political uncertainty, stretched supply chains and shortages of suitably skilled labor,” Moore added."
1133,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Australia's central bank on hold as economy set to seal 27 years without recession,"By Wayne Cole and Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank entered its third year of policy stability on Tuesday, and a change seems no nearer even as its commercial cousins nudge up their home loan rates to protect profit margins.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its September board meeting with rates held at an all-time low of 1.50 percent and signaling a steady policy ahead.
Even though the status quo decision was widely expected, the Australian dollar  bounced more than a quarter of a U.S. cent to reverse early losses as Governor Philip Lowe sounded staunchly upbeat about the A$1.8 trillion economy. 
""In the first half of 2018, the economy is estimated to have grown at an above-trend rate,"" Lowe said. 
""Business conditions are positive and non-mining business investment is expected to increase.""
Still, the bank was in no hurry to hike, given wage growth and inflation remain uncomfortably low. 
An added reason for caution was a recent increase in mortgage rates by Australia's No.2 lender Westpac (AX:WBC).
Westpac's move had led interbank futures <0#YIB:> to push back the chance of a hike to early 2020 as traders wagered other banks would follow suit, leading to a de-facto tightening in the market. 
However, Lowe did not acknowledge Westpac's move in his short statement while repeating average mortgage rates were still lower than a year ago. He also appeared comfortable about a slowdown in the housing market, saying there was still competition in the market for good-quality borrowers.
""The RBA is cautious by nature, reluctant to take risks, and that is a sound approach in the current climate,"" said Callam Pickering, APAC economist for global job site Indeed.
Pickering cited mortgage rate hikes by Westpac as one reason for the RBA to stay on the sidelines.
""Even if the economy was in a strong spot, why would the RBA bother hiking when the banks are doing it for them?""
UPBEAT ECONOMY
Second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) figures due on Wednesday are seen likely to show the economy notched up its 27th year without a recession, with expectations cemented by data out earlier. 
Government spending, which accounts for almost a quarter of annual GDP, rose 1 percent in the second quarter.
Other data showed net exports added around 0.1 percentage points to GDP in the quarter, thanks in part to strength in rural goods, energy and tourism.
A median of 16 analysts polled by Reuters forecasts GDP growth of 0.7 percent in the June quarter from the March quarter when it rose 1.0 percent. Annual growth likely slowed to a still-solid 2.8 percent, from a surprisingly rapid 3.1 percent the previous quarter.
The RBA is still predicting growth of a little above 3 percent for this year and next, with a boom in infrastructure spending driving much of that expansion.
But fears of a global trade war and strains in emerging markets have also reinforced investors' suspicions that rates will stay low for a long time to come.
""With the full effect of tighter lending conditions, falling house prices and a weaker global backdrop yet to be felt, such an acceleration in growth looks like a pipe dream to us,"" said Paul Dales, Sydney-based chief economist at Capital Economics.

""If so, then wage growth and underlying inflation are unlikely to rise as the RBA is hoping, which would make it very challenging for the RBA to build the case for a rate hike before the end of next year.""

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",UAE private-sector growth slows in August as employment slumps: PMI,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Expansion of the United Arab Emirates' non-oil private sector slowed to a five-month low in August as total employment shrank for the first time on record, a survey of companies showed on Tuesday.
The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD UAE Purchasing Managers' Index, which covers manufacturing and services, fell to 55.0 last month from 55.8 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion and below that level, contraction.
Output growth accelerated to 63.1 from 61.9, but growth in new orders slowed to a 20-month low of 57.1 from 60.6. The reading for employment sank to 49.0 from 50.2, falling below 50 for the first time since the survey was launched in August 2009.
Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD, Dubai's biggest bank, said the lack of job creation appeared to be caused by cost containment and efficiency measures at companies facing a sustained squeeze on profit margins.
""Although input costs were unchanged month-on-month in August, these have been rising over the last few years even as selling prices have declined on average,"" she said, noting that output prices fell outright for a fourth straight month. 
Among various pressures on corporate bottom lines, the UAE imposed 5 percent value-added tax at the start of this year, which has pushed some companies into discounting to keep market share. 
In the last several months, both Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the two biggest emirates in the UAE, have announced steps to cut or freeze government fees and charges to reduce cost pressures on companies.
""The August PMI survey suggests that while activity in the non-oil private sector is expanding at a similar rate to last year, margin pressures on firms mean that this growth in new work and output is not translating to job creation or higher wages,"" Haque said.

""As a result, we retain our view that private consumption is unlikely to contribute significantly to gross domestic product growth this year, with government spending and investment, and net exports likely to be the engines of growth.""

The economy has been hit hard in the last few years by low oil prices and government austerity, but the International Monetary Fund predicts it will start picking up this year as state spending and oil output increase.
The corporate survey indicated that process may now be underway. The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.1 last month from 54.9 in July; a level above 50 indicates expansion.
Output growth accelerated to 59.7 from 58.8, while growth of new orders climbed to 59.0 from 58.5. Employment growth slowed marginally, however, to 51.0.
Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD, said the survey data showed non-oil private sector growth had accelerated in the last three months, but noted that the average PMI reading so far this year was still the slowest since the survey was launched in August 2009.
""Employment growth was also relatively modest in August, with just 2 percent of firms surveyed reporting increased hiring,"" she added.
Some firms said domestic demand was supported by promotional activity such as discounts; output prices fell outright for a second straight month in August even as input price inflation remained positive, Haque said.

However, companies were on balance optimistic about their future output, with 17 percent expecting their output to be higher in a year’s time -- although this was a slightly lower proportion than in July, she added.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported sluggish sales growth last month as potential shoppers chose to make the most of this summer's record hot weather and spend money at the pub instead.
The British Retail Consortium said on Tuesday that shops reported total spending was up just 1.3 percent on a year earlier, the weakest growth since November last year, apart from a big dip in April due to the timing of the Easter holiday.
By contrast, a broader measure of consumer spending by Barclaycard (L:BARC), which processes just under half of card payments in Britain, rose by 4.5 percent in August -- boosted by an 11.9 percent year-on-year jump in spending at pubs.
British weather forecasters say 2018 has been the joint-hottest summer since records began in 1910, though temperatures in August were closer to average than those in June and July.
Supermarkets, pubs and restaurants have benefited from the hot weather, and the earlier soccer World Cup, as Britons enjoyed barbecues and eating and drinking outside.
By contrast, clothing sales suffered last month as shoppers delayed buying autumn ranges.
The BRC said a broader squeeze on consumers from above-target inflation and sluggish wage growth was denting spending on goods other than food, and that as the weather cooled later in August food sales dropped off too.
Online sales continued to hurt traditional retailers, and total in-store sales of non-food items fell by the most since records for this category began in January 2012, down by 2.2 percent on the year.
Looking ahead, Barclaycard said a third of people it surveyed planned to rein in spending this autumn.
""Many customers are planning to tighten their belts and keep a closer eye on their finances after spending more than usual over the summer,"" Barclaycard director Esme Harwood said.

The BRC data were based on sales over the four weeks to Aug. 25, while the Barclaycard figures come from transactions between July 22 and Aug. 18, as well as a survey of 1,697 consumers conducted by market research company YouGov on Aug. 20-21.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Brazil inflation seen grinding to a halt in August,"By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer prices in Brazil likely stagnated in August as a slow economic recovery continued to weigh on employment, a Reuters poll showed, suggesting the central bank should be in no rush to raise interest rates despite a currency sell-off.
The benchmark IPCA price index probably held flat compared with July, according to the median of 19 forecasts. 
It would be the weakest reading since mid-July 2017, highlighting how price pressures remain muted after product shortages stemming from a late-May truckers' strike normalized. Five economists, in fact, expected an outright decline, with estimates ranging from -0.04 percent to -0.19 percent.
""The effect of the truckers' strike on food, fuel and energy prices appears to have faded,"" economists at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) wrote in a report.
That would keep the annual inflation rate, scheduled for release on Thursday at 9:00 a.m. (local time) at 4.30 percent, the survey showed, the same rate as in mid-August and below the 4.48 percent reading at the end of July. 
The reading underscores the central bank's struggles to reignite price hikes in a weak economy, with the unemployment rate hovering in double digits for months and companies grappling with idle capacity.
Growth picked up slightly in the second quarter despite the truckers' strike, but downward revisions to previous readings triggered a string of forecast cuts for the year-end figure.
Even the annual inflation forecast in the poll is likely to overstate underlying inflation pressures as scarce rains drove regulators to keep power rates high. When stripped of volatile items such as energy costs, so-called core inflation probably remained at around 3.5 percent, UBS economists estimated.
That is likely to keep the central bank from lifting rates from an all-time low for the time being, even as uneasiness about this year's presidential election added to an emerging market rout and pushed the Brazilian real (BRBY) to a 2-1/2 year low.
Still, UBS expected core inflation to accelerate gradually as the effect of a weaker currency spreads, driving year-end inflation to reach the midpoint of the official 2018 target range, 4.5 percent.

Central bankers have repeatedly stressed that currency moves will only drive monetary policy insofar as they affect other prices or inflation expectations. According to a weekly central bank survey, economists expect inflation to reach 4.16 percent by year-end.

Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.8 in August, compared to forecasts for a reading of 53.9. That was its lowest reading in the last 25 months
The prior month’s reading was 53.8.
The report indicated that the slowdown was due to the first contraction in new export orders since April 2016.
It also highlighted that job creation slowed to near-stagnation in August, while business optimism dipped to a 22-month low.
“Based on its historical relationship with official ONS data, the latest PMI report is broadly consistent with zero growth in manufacturing production, meaning the sector will likely fail to provide any support to the wider UK economy in the third quarter,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
“While a hoped-for improvement in new export order growth and new product launches are forecast to stimulate future expansion, manufacturers are also expressing rising concerns about the uncertain backdrop of Brexit,” he concluded."

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing growth slowed to a near two-year low in August as optimism dwindled amid growing fears of an escalating global trade war, a survey showed on Monday.
However, this edition of the survey should be treated with some caution. It only represents about 70 percent of the usual sample size as swathes of European factories take a break over the summer months.
IHS Markit's August final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to a 21-month low of 54.6 from July's 55.1, unchanged from an initial reading, yet still comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
An output index, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and is regarded as a good gauge of economic health, nudged up to 54.7 from 54.4.
""Euro zone factories reported a further solid production gain in August, but prospects dimmed further as growth of new orders hit a two-year low and worries about the outlook deepened,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Forward-looking indicators such as employment, optimism and new orders all fell, suggesting there would be little if any pick-up in activity this month.
The future output index, which measures optimism, fell from 62.4 to 61.0 - its second lowest reading since late 2015.
Manufacturers are increasingly concerned about a growing global trade dispute. U.S. President Donald Trump has told aides he is ready to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports.
So to try and drum up demand, factories increased prices at the weakest rate in a year. Official data on Friday showed inflation in the bloc eased to 2.0 percent last month, supporting the European Central Bank's assessment that a recent spike may only be temporary.

Still, price pressures have built up enough for the ECB to curb some of its measures. The central bank plans to end its bond purchase program this year, although interest rates are expected remain unchanged for another year.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 11:49PM ET</span>","Wary Australian consumers dampen July retail sales, point to cautious third-quarter","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales fizzled out in July while nationwide home prices fell again in August and a measure of job advertisement eased, suggesting a further dent in consumer confidence and spending.
Monday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed retail sales for July were flat, the weakest result since March. That lagged expectations of 0.3 percent growth and followed a respectable 0.4 percent rise in June.
Clothing and footwear led declines with a 2 percent fall while sales at department stores eased 1.9 percent and household goods retailing faltered 1.2 percent. The drops were offset by gains in food, cafes and restaurants - a category that has remained resilient over the past year or so.
The downbeat data briefly weighed on the Australian dollar <AUD=D3> which slipped to $0.7166, the lowest since early 2017. The currency was last at $0.7177, off 0.2 percent.
The disappointing sales come as economists worry about the impact on household consumption from snail-paced wage growth and a slowdown in Australia's once-booming housing market.
Worryingly, data out earlier in the day showed Australian job advertisements eased in August and were no longer pointing to a further decline in the unemployment rate.
Separate figures showed home prices fell for the 11th straight month in August as banks tighten lending standards amid damaging revelations of some of their business practices.
Lending growth is at its weakest in more than 4 years while measures of consumer confidence have remained subdued for more than a year now.
All of this means the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will stay on its steady policy path as it awaits a pick-up in inflation and economic growth. The central bank is all but certain to keep rates at a record low 1.50 percent at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday.
""Ongoing home price falls in Sydney and Melbourne will depress consumer spending as the wealth effect is now going in reverse,"" said AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver.
""It's consistent with our view that the RBA will leave rates on hold out to late 2020 at least.""
UPSIDE RISK TO GDP
Separate data from the ABS on company earnings showed gross operating profits rose 2.0 percent in the June quarter, the third straight quarter of solid gains that left profits up more than 11 percent on a year earlier.
There was also some better news on household incomes.
Firms paid out A$137 billion ($98.3 billion) in wages and salaries in the June quarter, up 1.2 percent on the previous quarter. The wage bill rose 4.5 percent annually, more than double individual pay growth as employers take on more workers.
The report also showed inventories likely subtracted a bare 0.1 percentage point from economic growth in the second quarter.
""That was a slightly smaller drag than we anticipated,"" said Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan. ""Overall, surprises in the business survey were to the high side. This suggests risks to our Q2 GDP growth forecast of 0.6 percent are tilted to the upside.""
Australia's GDP data is due Wednesday and a Reuters poll of 16 economists show the A$1.8 trillion economy likely expanded at 0.7 percent last quarter, slower than the brisk pace of 1.0 percent in the three-month ended March.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 11:35PM ET</span>",China August manufacturing growth slows to 14-month low: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing activity grew at the slowest pace in more than a year in August, with export orders shrinking for a fifth month and employers cutting more staff, a private survey showed on Monday.
The gloomy findings reinforce views of a further cooling in China's economy in coming months, as the United States ramps up tariffs on Chinese goods. That is likely to prompt more spending and other growth boosting steps from Beijing.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.6 in August from July's 50.8, matching  economists' forecasts.  
Though the index remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 15th consecutive month, it was the weakest since June 2017. While output improved modestly, most of the other readings were lackluster.  
""The manufacturing sector continued to weaken amid soft demand, even though the supply side was still stable...I don't think that stable supply can be sustained amid weak demand,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the survey. 
""In addition, the worsening employment situation is likely to have an impact on consumption growth. China's economy is now facing relatively obvious downward pressure.”
The economy was already showing signs of stress before the U.S. trade row flared. A regulatory crackdown on financial risks and debt was pushing up borrowing costs and making it tougher for firms to get funding, sparking a growing number of defaults.
But the steady reports of weaker export orders suggest the deepening trade dispute is now adding to that pressure, with the impact starting to ripple through to China's factory floors.
New export orders - an indicator of future activity -- have contracted for the longest stretch since the first half of 2016, the Caixin PMI showed.
The sub-index came in at 48.8 in August, compared with 48.4 in July. As a result, total new business, domestic and foreign, rose at the weakest pace since May 2017.
An official PMI survey on Friday also showed another month of sliding export orders, though its overall activity reading ticked higher. 
President Donald Trump's administration could slap tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese imports as early as this week.
COST PRESSURES 
Facing rising costs and sluggish demand, China's manufacturers have been reducing their payrolls for nearly five years straight, according to the Caixin survey, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms. But the August staff cuts were the sharpest in over a year.
An analysis of financial data of Shanghai-listed companies published by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Sunday confirmed that some companies are grappling with cost pressures. 
Their report found that downstream consumer firms were being squeezed in the first half of the year by higher raw materials costs and weaker-than-expected consumer demand, while upstream and midstream oil, metals and chemicals manufacturers posted the strongest profit growth.
Some firms are also facing operating difficulties due to trade frictions between the United States and China and economic restructuring, the report said. 
Chinese officials have pledged to prevent extensive job losses as trade risks mount, following a rise in the July unemployment rate.
Policymakers are accelerating approvals for road and rail projects and are trying to reduce business costs. More cash is being pumped into the financial system to bring down lending rates, taxes are being cut and state banks are being urged to keep credit flowing to companies hit by trade tensions.
But economists caution it will take some time for actual infrastructure construction to get going and put a floor under the cooling economy. Fixed-asset investment growth in the first seven months of the year fell to a record low.
Meanwhile, corporate price pressures continue to rise, the private survey showed. Input costs increased at a sharp and accelerated pace last month but only one in 10 respondents said they were able to pass these on to their customers.

    The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.5 in August from a final 52.3 in July.
    The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 24th consecutive month.
    ""Survey data signaled a moderate improvement in the health of the sector, supported by an accelerated influx of new orders,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
    ""That said, survey data indicated the upturn in demand was domestic-led, with export sales falling over the month. Potential escalations in trade conflict also contributed to a softening of business confidence.""
    The index for new orders rose to a preliminary 52.4 from a final 50.9 in July, the first increase in four months, as the launch of new products boosted sales, the survey showed.
    The index for export orders showed contraction, falling to 49.7 from 50.0 in July due to weaker demand from China, the survey showed.
Output prices charged by Japanese manufacturers rose at the fastest pace since October 2008 due to rising input costs, the survey showed. However, retailers are likely to remain reluctant to raise consumer prices for fear of alienating shoppers.
    Japan's factory output fell for a third straight month in July due to slowing exports of cars and steel, data last week showed.
    Steel output also fell because the United States has imposed tariffs on steel imports from Japan and other trading partners.
    There are also concerns that President Donald Trump will ask Japan to take specific steps to lower its trade deficit with the United States. 
    The Trump administration is renegotiating free trade deals that they say are unfair to U.S. companies and workers.

    The U.S. government is also engaged in a trade war with China, and there are concerns that Japan's export-oriented economy is also vulnerable.

National dwelling values dropped 0.3 percent last month, led by declines in Sydney and Melbourne, according to CoreLogic Inc. data released Monday. Prices in Sydney, the epicenter of the recent property boom, have now fallen 5.6 percent from a year earlier.
“Looking forward, there are a few wildcards that could create some headwinds for housing market conditions,” CoreLogic said in the statement.
Westpac Banking Corp.’s move last week to raise home loan rates “is likely to send a chill through the housing market,” CoreLogic said. Tight credit conditions and record household debt could also damp confidence as the peak spring selling season starts.

The University of Michigan on Friday said its consumer sentiment index fell to a reading of 96.2 at end of August. While that was an improvement from 95.3 early in the month, it was the lowest reading since January and was down from 97.9 in July. The survey's current conditions sub-index of consumer expectations dropped to 110.3 from July's reading of 114.4.
""The dominating weakness was related to less favorable assessments of buying conditions, mainly due to less favorable perceptions of market prices and to a lesser extent, rising interest rates,"" said Richard Curtin, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers chief economist.
Consumers' inflation expectations increased this month.
""Although a higher inflation rate is partly due to the potential for increased tariffs, the main cause has been the expectation of robust economic growth,"" said Curtin.
The Trump administration's protectionist trade policy has led to an escalating trade war with China and tit-for-tat import tariffs with other trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace notched in the January-March period.
Prices have been rising, with an inflation measure tracked by the Federal Reserve hitting the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in July for the third time this year.
The University of Michigan's sentiment survey is at odds with the Conference Board survey published on Tuesday, which showed consumer confidence surging to a near 18-year high in August.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's annual economic growth surged to a more than two-year high of 8.2 percent in the three months through June, giving Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government a political boost in the final year of his term before elections.
Modi has been under pressure to make good his promise to deliver reforms and provide jobs to the millions of young people who enter the workforce each year as he faces a clutch of state elections this year followed by his planned re-election bid in 2019.
Data released on Friday showed manufacturing and consumer spending driving expansion, raising hopes that the rural economy was starting to turnaround. 
The latest period's annual pace beat a Reuters poll forecast of 7.6 percent, and was the highest since India logged 9.3 percent growth in the January-March quarter of 2016.
It easily surpassed the 6.7 percent growth posted by China for the same quarter, and it restored India's growth to levels posted by the Congress governments during the decade before Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014.
""This is New India of PM Narendra Modi's vision; with a strong, sustained momentum of growth,"" Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore said on Twitter, leading a drum beat of praise for Modi for his stewardship of the economy. 
India's $2.6 trillion economy surpassed France's in 2017 to become the world's sixth largest, and it was not far behind the United Kingdom, according to World Bank data.
But the GDP growth comes off a low base of 5.6 percent for the same quarter a year ago and it relates to the period just before the annual monsoon rains which are the lifeblood of India's economy. 
So far the rains, which run from June to September, have been slightly below normal and uneven with some areas running a deficit of over 40 percent while others are flooded.
SUSTAINABLE GAINS?
There are headwinds on the external sector with high oil prices putting pressure on inflation and rising trade protectionism affecting India's export prospects.
On Friday the Indian rupee  closed at a record low of 71.01 to the dollar, tracking weakness across other emerging economies as concerns mounted that the United States would impose fresh trade tariffs on China next week
Also on Friday India reported a fiscal deficit  of 5.4 trillion rupees ($76.12 billion) for April-July, or 86.5 percent of the budgeted target for the current fiscal year as the government front loaded its spending for the whole fiscal year. 
Subhash Garg, the economic affairs secretary, told reporters the government will stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 percent of GDP this fiscal year. He expected the economy to grow at a pace faster than 7.5 percent in the fiscal year. 
Greater government spending has given households more money to buy consumer durables, which helped the manufacturing sector post 13.5 percent growth in June quarter, in sharp contrast to the 1.8-percent contraction recorded a year earlier. 
Government spending grew 12.7 percent year-on-year compared with a 1.5 percent year-on-year growth in the March quarter.
Capital investment rebounded to 13.9 percent from a 9.4 percent rise in the March quarter.
On the weak side, data suggested growth in mining slowed to just 0.1 percent compared with 2.7 percent in the previous quarter. 
""This is probably the best GDP trend we have seen in the first half of the fiscal year,"" said Shashank Mendiratta, India economist at ANZ Bank.
He said that with a general election less than a year away the GDP numbers were mostly driven by public investment and higher consumption especially in the rural areas. 
""We expect RBI to hike rates in March-quarter next year with no changes this year,"" he said.
On Wednesday, India's central bank said economic growth was expected to accelerate to 7.4 percent in the fiscal year ending next March, bettering the 6.7 percent posted last fiscal year, despite risks posed by higher oil prices and global trade tensions.
The Reserve Bank of India has raised its benchmark repo rate  by a total of 50 basis points at its past two meetings, to 6.5 percent, to tame inflation that has remained above its medium-term target of 4 percent for the last nine months.
The RBI's next policy is due on Oct.5. 
In July, retail inflation eased to 4.17 percent from a year earlier, but is projected to remain around 4.8 percent in the second half of the fiscal year.

The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index was revised up to 96.2 from 95.3.
Economists had forecast a reading of 95.5.
A sub index tracking consumer expectations unexpectedly fell from 87.3 to 87.1 in August.
Consensus expected a slight increase to 87.5.
A separate gauge tracking current conditions increased from 107.8 to 110.3.
Economists had estimated a reading of 108.1.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months ticked up to 3%, while the five-year gauge rose to 2.6% from the previous 2.5%.
Despite the uptick in the revised data, the survey center’s chief economist Richard Curtin highlighted that consumer sentiment remained at its lowest level since January.
He noted that most of the August decline was in the Current Economic Conditions Index, which fell to its lowest level since November 2016.
“These results stand in sharp contrast to the recent very favorable report on growth in the national economy,” Curtin said.
“While nominal wage expectations and employment gains have remained strong, the anticipated inflation rate has also increased to its highest level in four years,” he added.
He suggested that the increase in inflation expectations was partly due to the potential for increased tariffs, but insisted that the main cause was the expectation of robust economic growth.
“Luckily, consumers have not yet judged the current rate of inflation as a significant source of erosion in their living standards or as a cause to reduce their buying plans,” Curtin said."

The non-manufacturing PMI, covering services and construction, also rose to 54.2, the statistics bureau said Friday, compared with 54 in July. Levels above 50 indicate improvement.
With the U.S. already raising tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods, such strength may prove difficult to sustain, and levies on another $200 billion may be imposed as soon as next week. That said, government measures to ensure the supply of credit and stoke investment in infrastructure may be already brightening the outlook among businesses at home.
“The nation’s pro-growth measures have taken effect to stabilize sentiment,"" said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered who accurately forecast the PMI this month. Ding cited more proactive fiscal policy, tax cuts, expedited bond sales and better credit access for smaller companies.
The onshore yuan climbed 0.15 percent to 6.8339 to the dollar as of 10:51, after the People’s Bank of China set a stronger-than-expected daily reference rate. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent, while the Hang Seng Index declined 1.2 percent.
China announced Thursday that it will exempt foreign institutions from paying some taxes on interest gains in the onshore bond market as part of efforts to support the economy. The exemption announced after a State Council meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang covered corporate income and value-added taxes for a period tentatively set at three years.
The reading for smaller manufacturers rose to 50 in August after remaining in the deterioration zone for three months, highlighting that central bank policies to support that vital part of the economy may be helping to underpin confidence. The reading for larger companies edged lower for a third month, though was still at a robust level of 52.1.
“Steady production and new domestic orders outweighed weaker new export orders,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists including Jenny Zheng wrote in a note. “The economy could remain on a path of soft landing, as defensive easing measures could boost infrastructure investment and cushion potential impact from trade tensions.”
The official PMI result runs counter to some leading data as collated by Bloomberg Economics’ deck of early indicators. That showed output weakening again in August, as demand from key trading partners softened and sentiment among stock investors worsened.
""This quarter and the next three are going to be pretty weak,"" said Andrew Polk, co-founder of research firm Trivium China in Beijing.

The respite may prove brief, however. Export orders shrank for a third straight month, suggesting a flurry of punitive U.S. trade measures are starting to bite. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Friday rose to 51.3 in August, from 51.2 in July, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for a 25th straight month.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would dip slightly for a third straight month to 51.0.
The PMI reading shows China's manufacturing sector is continuing to expand at a steady pace, statistics bureau official Zhao Qinghe said in a statement with the data. 
But he acknowledged international trade frictions and other external uncertainties are hurting exports and imports.
The PMI sub-index on new export orders indicated contraction for a third straight month and was at the lowest level since February at 49.4, compared to 49.8 in July. 
The import sub-index, considered a gauge of domestic demand, was at the lowest level in at least a year at 49.1, down from 49.6 in July. 
Weighed down by rising financing costs, China's economy was already starting to cool even before the trade dispute with Washington escalated, with investment growth at a record low and consumers turning more cautious about spending.
That has prompted Beijing to speed up infrastructure spending and offer help to smaller companies to prevent a sharper slowdown, though policymakers are wary of adding to a mountain of debt that was fueled by past stimulus binges.
U.S. and Chinese officials ended two days of talks last Thursday with no major breakthrough as their trade war escalated with activation of another round of dueling tariffs on $16 billion worth of each country's goods.
U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ranging from furniture to bicycles are expected to take effect next month.
While China's official export data has been largely resilient so far, analysts suspect that may be due to companies rushing out shipments before further tariffs kick in, raising the risk of a sharp dropoff in coming months.
Chinese exports may only grow 2 percent in yuan terms in the second half of this year, the State Information Center under the National Development and Reform Commission predicted. That compared with a 4.9 percent rise in first half.
A production sub-index rose to 53.3 in August from 53.0 in July, while a new orders sub-index declined to 52.2 from 52.3.
A sister survey released by the NBS showed growth in China's services sector also picked up in August, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rising to 54.2 from 54.0 the previous month.
Chinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for more than half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.

But retail sales unexpectedly moderated in July despite a broad import tax cut last month, indicating consumers are turning more cautious, while disposable income is rising at a slower pace.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in July, suggesting strong economic growth early in the third quarter, while a measure of underlying inflation hit the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for the third time this year.
Other data on Thursday showed an increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend continued to point to a robust labor market.
There are, however, concerns the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has led to an escalating trade war with China and tit-for-tat import tariffs with other trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico, could hurt the economy.
""The trade war thunder on the horizon hasn't moved closer to shore,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Consumers are doing their part to keep the economy's engines running strong in the second half of the year.""
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4 percent last month after advancing by the same margin in June. Households spent more at restaurants and on accommodation last month. 
There was also an increase in spending on prescription medication. Last month's rise in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations.
Prices continued their gradual upward trend in July. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in June.
That lifted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 2.0 percent from 1.9 percent in June. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.
Minutes of the Fed's July 31-Aug. 1 meeting published last week showed some policymakers worried that ""a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to inflationary pressures.""
Given strong domestic demand and a tightening labor market, inflation could rise further, likely keeping the Fed on track to increase interest rates for a third time this year in September. Import duties, which have boosted prices for raw materials such as steel, lumber and aluminum, are seen fanning inflation.
""Inflation pressures should intensify in coming quarters,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Therefore, the Fed is going to continue to raise rates once per quarter through the remainder of this year and into next."" 
The dollar (DXY) was trading marginally higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields dropped. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower amid lingering concerns over trade tensions between the United States and China.
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET
While rising inflation is eating into consumer spending, the pace of growth in consumption is enough to continue driving the economy. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending gained 0.2 percent in July, the smallest rise in five months, after increasing 0.3 percent in June. 
Strong consumer spending helped fire up the economy in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising at a 4.2 percent annualized rate, the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace notched in the January-March period.
Consumer spending should blunt some of the impact on the economy from an anticipated widening in the trade deficit and weakness in the housing market in the third quarter. Recent data showed a sharp rise in the goods trade deficit in July as well as further declines in home sales and a moderate rise in homebuilding last month.
Spending is being supported by the labor market, which is viewed as being near or at full employment, as well as the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Aug. 25. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,500 last week to 212,250, the lowest level since December 1969.
In July, spending on goods rose 0.2 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in June. Outlays on services increased 0.4 percent after surging 0.6 percent in the prior month. Personal income rose 0.3 percent in July after advancing 0.4 percent in the prior month. 
Wages rose 0.4 percent. Higher inflation, however, is cutting into those gains. Income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation climbed 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in June. Savings were little changed at $1.05 trillion.

""Households have a healthy cushion of savings into which they can dip to sustain spending,"" said Michelle Girard,chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy expanded in the second quarter at the fastest pace in one year as exports climbed, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday, but the improved growth was not expected to trigger an interest hike next week from the Bank of Canada.
Gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.9 percent in the second quarter of the year, short of economists' expectations for 3.0 percent but ahead of the Bank of Canada's estimate of 2.8 percent.
""It's slightly below expectations but still indicating a doubling of the growth rate relative to this point in the first quarter,"" said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
""The bank is prepared to tighten further but, as they've emphasized, the pace is gradual. I think they're likely to remain on the sidelines in September but we lean toward a move come October assuming the data continues to show solid underlying strength.""
The central bank, which has raised interest rates four times since July 2017, is due to make a decision on interest rates on Wednesday.
Chances of a rate hike at that meeting slipped to less than 20 percent from 23 percent before the data, the overnight index swaps market indicated.
The Canadian dollar, which has been boosted this week by optimism that a trilateral deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement could be reached, weakened about 0.6 percent against its U.S. counterpart.
Growth in the second quarter was the fastest since the same period last year, while first-quarter growth was revised higher to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent.
On a non-annualized basis, exports climbed 2.9 percent, helped by increases for energy products and consumer goods. It was the biggest advance for exports since the second quarter of 2014.
Household spending rose 0.6 percent after a more tepid 0.3 percent advance in the first quarter. It was led by a 0.8 percent rise in outlays on services.
Business investment rose 0.4 percent, which was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2016. 
June's GDP growth was flat as a result of reduced output in the oil and gas extraction sector, and lower activity in wholesale and retail trade.

Oil and gas extraction was weighed by a drop in non-conventional oil extraction after a power outage at a production facility. Production at Syncrude Canada's oil sands facility went offline in June.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Aug. 25, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised. 
Claims had declined for three straight weeks. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 214,000 in the latest week.
The Labor Department said only claims for Maine were estimated last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,500 last week to 212,250, the lowest level since December 1969.
There are no signs so far in the claims data that the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has led to an escalating trade war with China and tit-for-tat import tariffs with other trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico, is hurting the labor market.
The jobs market, which is viewed as being near or at full employment, is steadily raising wage growth, helping to support consumer spending and boost the overall economy. 
The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest pace in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent rate notched in the January-March period.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 20,000 to 1.71 million for the week ended Aug. 18. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 1.73 million. 
The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which August's unemployment rate will be derived. The four-week average of continuing claims declined 15,000 between the July and August survey weeks, suggesting an improvement in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate was at 3.9 percent in July.

1158,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. Consumer Spending, Inflation Rose in July; Incomes Cooled","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer spending extended gains into July and inflation rose to a six-year high, reflecting economic strength that should keep Federal Reserve policy makers on track to keep gradually raising interest rates.
Purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.4 percent from the prior month for the second straight time, matching economists’ estimates, Commerce Department figures showed Thursday. Incomes advanced 0.3 percent, less than projected. The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation ticked up, as forecast, to a 2.3 percent annual gain, the most since 2012.
The first third-quarter readings for some of the broadest gauges of the world’s largest economy show consumers are continuing to drive growth while reinforcing that inflation is about where Fed policy makers want it. A key measure of underlying inflation hit 2 percent, matching the Fed’s goal for overall price gains, as central bankers pencil in boosting borrowing costs two moretimes this year, with one of those quarter-point hikes expected in September.
The spending gain reflected increases in outlays on prescription drugs as well as food services and accommodations, according to the report. Previously-released figures on retail sales had showed large advances in restaurant receipts.
A separate Labor Department report Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits last week remained near the lowest level in almost five decades, indicating employers are still reluctant to fire workers. Initial jobless claims rose 3,000 to 213,000, compared with the median estimate of analysts for 212,000.
Inflation Gauges
Price measures were in line with analyst estimates. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge -- tied to consumption -- rose 0.1 percent from the previous month. Some Fed officials have indicated that they’re comfortable with annual inflation exceeding their target a bit, given that price gains were below their goal for most of the past six years.
Excluding food and energy, so-called core prices rose 0.2 percent from the prior month. The core index, seen as a more reliable gauge of underlying inflation, was up 2 percent from July 2017, after a 1.9 percent increase in June.
Highlighting the effects of rising prices, inflation-adjusted spending rose 0.2 percent from the prior month, the slowest pace since a decline in February.
Wages and salaries rose 0.4 percent for a second month, the July report showed. Disposable income, or earnings adjusted for taxes and inflation, advanced 0.2 percent after a 0.3 percent gain.
Paychecks have been slow to show sustained progress even with robust hiring and an unemployment rate hovering near the lowest since 1969. While lower taxes are helping consumers, the pickup in inflation is acting as a hurdle.
In the second quarter, the economy expanded at a 4.2 percent annualized rate, the fastest since 2014, with consumption rebounding to a 3.8 percent pace, according to revised data released Wednesday. President Donald Trump has claimed credit for the pickup in growth, with his administration targeting 3 percent annual expansion.
Thursday’s report also showed the saving rate fell to 6.7 percent, the lowest since December, from 6.8 percent the prior month. Comprehensive revisions issued in July revealed Americans putting away more money in recent years than had been earlier thought.

Cheng said he expected sales growth in August to remain in single digits, and forecast second-half growth of 6-7 percent. 
Hong Kong's retail sales are strong despite slowing economic growth after a solid start to the year. Some analysts expect growth to slow further as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington and higher interest rates start to bite.

The Commission survey showed the economic sentiment indictor for the 19 countries sharing the euro currency eased to 111.6 points in August from 112.1 in July, continuing a downward trend started since a peak of 115.2 last December.
Separately, the Commission's business climate indictor, which helps identify the phase of the business cycle, fell to 1.22 in August from 1.30 in July, following a similar downward path from a peak of 1.63 in January.
The easing of sentiment in August came with a decline of the indicator for industry, to 5.5 from 5.8, although production expectations rebounded after a July decline.
Their views on current overall order books and stocks of finished products worsened, as did the their assessment of export order books.

While the August manufacturing slowdown is expected to be modest, it will reinforce views that the world's second-largest economy is continuing to lose steam even as Washington readies even tougher tariffs on Chinese goods.
That is likely to prompt Beijing to roll out more growth boosting measures, adding to a spate of recent spending announcements, tax cuts and steps to lower companies' financing costs. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to fall to 51.0 in August from 51.2 in July, according to the median forecast of 37 economists in the Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
China's manufacturing industry has been growing for two years but is now facing a triple threat -- higher borrowing costs; cooling investment and consumer spending; and a potential export shock.
Indeed, the head of China's top planning agency said on Wednesday that economy faces increasing risks in the second half of the year and policymakers need to step up efforts to hit key development goals.
China's economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter, still comfortably above the official 2018 growth target of around 6.5 percent but enough to put policymakers on edge as they braced for export disruptions. 
Beijing has pledged to speed up infrastructure investment to stabilize growth, and is also encouraging banks to lend more to smaller firms at better rates, though they maintain that a broad campaign to reduce financial risks and debt levels remains in place. 
Project approvals jumped nearly four-fold in July, but the benefits will take time to be felt, suggesting economic conditions will get worse before they get better.
Moreover, actual infrastructure spending may remain weak over the next few months as the finance ministry may be reluctant to reopen funding channels, Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note on Wednesday.
""Infrastructure spending may weaken further before it bottoms out,"" wrote Evans-Pritchard.
""While we think infrastructure investment growth is overshooting to the downside and will eventually see a partial recovery, we don’t anticipate a return to the double-digit growth rates of the past few years."" 
Data on Monday showed industrial profit growth slowed for a third month in July, adding to signs of slowing momentum in the economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose for a ninth straight month in July from a year earlier, handily beating economists' forecasts, in a sign private consumption is supporting the world's third largest economy.
However, the pace of gains slowed sharply on a month-on-month basis, suggesting that consumption may not be strong enough to spur economic growth in the current quarter or back the central bank's optimistic views.
July's 1.5 percent annual increase in retail sales topped the Reuters poll median forecast for 1.2 percent, trade ministry data showed on Thursday. It followed a 1.7 percent gain in June.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales grew just 0.1 percent in July from the previous month, far below June's 1.4 percent increase. 
""The upshot is that private consumption started Q3 on a soft note,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""However, the fundamentals for a continued improvement in spending remain in place,"" he said in a note. ""Both employment and wages are growing strongly so household incomes are expanding rapidly.""
Consumer spending is picking up moderately with more companies raising wages, as labour shortages stemming from Japan's ageing population force firms to pay better to find and retain workers.
ELUSIVE TARGET 
A rise in private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of economic activity, could lift consumer prices, which would help the central bank accelerate the inflation rate to its elusive 2 percent target.
The Bank of Japan conceded last month that inflation could remain below its target until early 2021.
""Employment and household incomes are not so robust as the BOJ thinks,"" said Azusa Kato, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities. ""As such, private consumption is likely to pull back from a rebound seen in the April-June quarter."" 
One factor pushing up July retail sales was higher gasoline prices. Other gains involved online retailers and items such as medicines and cosmetics while a heat wave lifted food and beverage purchases. 
These offset declines in sales of clothes and other items at department stores after June clearance sales.
The economy rebounded in April-June, led by strong household and business spending, but risks from global trade tension cloud the outlook for export-reliant Japan.

Japan's annual core consumer inflation, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, held steady at 0.8 percent in July, well below the BOJ's 2 percent price goal, data showed last week.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 12:41PM ET</span>",U.S. second-quarter GDP growth raised to 4.2 percent,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought in the second quarter, notching its best performance in nearly four years and putting the economy on track to hit the Trump administration's goal of 3 percent annual growth.
Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2 percent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday in its second estimate of GDP growth for the April-June quarter. That was slightly up from the 4.1 percent pace of expansion reported in July and was the fastest rate since the third quarter of 2014.
The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the January-March period. The slight upward revision to growth last quarter reflected more business spending on software than previously estimated and less imported petroleum. 
Stronger software investment and a smaller import bill offset a downward revision to consumer spending. President Donald Trump, whose administration has vowed to boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis, cheered the revised second-quarter data.
""Our country is doing great!"" Trump tweeted.
The economy expanded 3.2 percent in the first half of 2018, up from the 3.1 percent estimated last month. Compared to the second quarter of 2017, output increased 2.9 percent instead of the previously reported 2.8 percent. Economists, however, cautioned that the second-quarter growth pace was unsustainable as it was largely driven by one-off factors.
In addition, the economy faces constraints such as low productivity and slow population growth.
The Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package provided a jolt to consumer spending after it almost stalled in the first quarter and soybean exports to China were front-loaded to beat retaliatory trade tariffs. 
There are signs some of the momentum was lost early in the third quarter. The government reported on Tuesday that the goods trade deficit jumped 6.3 percent to $72.2 billion in July as a 6.7 percent plunge in food shipments weighed on exports. 
While consumer spending has remained strong early in the third quarter, the housing market has weakened further with homebuilding rising less than expected in July and sales of new and previously owned homes falling amid a dearth of properties. 
The Trump administration's ""America First"" policies, which have led to an escalation of a trade war between the United States and China as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with the European Union, Canada and Mexico, pose a risk to the economy.
""We expect the pace of the expansion will cool in the second half of 2018, as the boost from fiscal stimulus starts to fade ... and trade protectionism weighs on activity,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Economists had expected second-quarter GDP growth would be revised down to a 4.0 percent pace. The robust growth pace likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates in September for the third time this year.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) hitting a record high. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies while prices of U.S. Treasuries mostly fell.

INCOME GROWTH COOLS
An alternative measure of economic growth, gross domestic income (GDI), increased at a rate of 1.8 percent in the second quarter, slowing from the first quarter's brisk 3.9 percent pace.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 3.0 percent rate in the April-June period, up from a 3.1 percent growth pace in the first quarter.
The income side of the growth ledger was restrained by after-tax corporate profits, which rose at a rate of 2.4 percent last quarter. After-tax profits grew at an 8.2 percent pace in the first quarter, boosted by the massive reduction in the corporate income tax rate. 
Some economists said the slowdown in second-quarter after-tax profits supported the view that the impact of the tax cuts would be temporary, potentially undercutting the White House's argument that they would boost business spending and job growth.
""The tax cuts' effect on boosting profits has already hit the corporate bottom line,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The question is what happens next year?""
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was lowered to a 3.8 percent rate in the second quarter instead of the previously reported 4.0 percent pace. Consumer spending increased at a 0.5 percent pace in the first quarter.
Soybean exports were accelerated in the second quarter to beat Chinese tariffs that took effect in July. Overall exports rose at a 9.1 percent rate in the second quarter. 
Imports fell at a 0.4 percent rate, with petroleum accounting for much of the decline. The decrease in imports was the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2015. Imports were previously reported to have grown at a 0.5 percent pace in the second quarter.
The drop in imports sharply narrowed the trade deficit. Trade added 1.17 percentage points to GDP growth in the second quarter rather than the previously reported 1.06 percentage points.
But the front-loading of soybean exports depleted farm inventories. Overall, inventories declined at a rate of $26.9 billion instead of the $27.9 billion pace reported last month. Inventories subtracted 0.97 percentage point from GDP growth in the second quarter.

Growth in business spending was raised to an 8.5 percent rate from a 7.3 percent pace, with investment in software accounting for the bulk of the increase.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, decreased 0.7 percent to 106.2 in July. Economists polled by Reuters expected an increase of 0.3 percent.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and recent declines in the NAR index have reflected generally tight supply.
Contracts for existing homes fell 2.3 percent last month on an annualized basis, the seventh such monthly drop.
Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said the decline reflected both supply constraints and a strong job market that is bidding up prices.
""Multiple years of inadequate supply in markets with strong job growth have finally driven up home prices to a point where an increasing number of prospective buyers are unable to afford it,"" Yun said.

1171,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 09:41AM ET</span>","US economic growth in the 2nd quarter gets revised higher, remains strongest since 2014","The US economy in the second quarter grew even faster than had been estimated, according to a report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday. 
 Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the value of every good and service produced domestically, rose at an annual rate of 4.2%, the fastest since Q3 2014. The advance estimate released in July had penciled in growth at 4.1%. 
Wednesday's upward revision, based on more complete data, showed that business investment and inventories contributed more to growth than previously thought. 
The April-June period was the first full quarter with the tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump in effect. Consumer spending rebounded from the first quarter. As usual, it was the biggest contributor to growth, although the revised data showed it was slightly weaker than first reported; personal consumption increased 3.8% versus 4% prior. Spending on vehicles and healthcare was revised lower. 
Expectations for growth in the third quarter vary widely. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecasting model estimates that the economy will grow at a 4.6% clip in the third quarter. But the New York Fed's Nowcast model has growth at just 1.96%. 
Many economists are doubtful that the economy can sustain a 4% growth rate, partly because of a yearslong slowdown in productivity."
1172,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. Second-Quarter Growth Revised Up to 4.2% on Software, Trade","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy expanded in the second quarter at a slightly faster pace than previously estimated on revisions to imports and software spending, bolstering the strongest period of growth since 2014, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday.
Key Takeaways
The revisions to GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., offer President Donald Trump another chance to stake his claim to the pickup in growth, as he did following the initial GDP report a month earlier. Trump had called the numbers “amazing” and “very sustainable,” declaring his policies, including the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, a success.
Even so, the pace of expansion is expected to cool from the second quarter as the tax-cut boost fades, a trade war threatens business demand and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project a 2.9 percent expansion for the full year.
Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, have been supported by a strong job market and lower taxes. In addition, a rise in gasoline costs earlier this year has eased, reducing a risk to spending.
The continuing acceleration in profit growth suggests corporate America is benefiting from strength in consumer and business demand. That, together with lower taxes, could bode well for further gains in investment this year.
Price data in the GDP report showed inflation was in line with the Fed’s 2 percent goal. Excluding food and energy, the central bank’s preferred price index that’s tied to personal spending rose at a 2 percent annualized rate, the same as in the initial report.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.2% annual rate in the three months to June, instead of the previously reported 4.1% pace, the Commerce Department said in its first GDP revision.
That was nearly double the 2.2% expansion registered in the first quarter and was the fastest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2014. Analysts had been expecting a decline to 4%.
Compared to the same quarter a year earlier, the economy grew 2.9%, up from the previously reported 2.8%.
Exports were revised down to 9.1% from 9.3%, while imports were revised to show a drop of 0.4%, from an increase of 0.5% in the initial estimate.
The upbeat data underlined expectations for the Federal Reserve to stick to plans for further gradual rate hikes.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said late last week that the strength of the U.S. economic expansion justifies gradually raising interest rates.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates in September, with traders currently pricing in a 100% chance of an increase according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, with the probability of another move in December seen at roughly 72.3%.
Those would come after rate hikes in March and June of this year."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German shoppers dipped for the second month in a row heading into September as income expectations fell, a survey showed on Wednesday, casting doubt on the strength of a consumer-led upswing.
Household expenditure was one of the main growth drivers in Europe's largest economy in the first half of 2018, together with state spending and investments in construction.
The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 10.5 from 10.6 a month earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an unchanged reading.
""While economic expectations improved, income expectations and the propensity to buy declined a bit,"" GfK researcher Ralf Buerkl said. All sub-indicators remained at a relatively high level, however.
He linked the dip in income expectations to a rise in energy prices that has propelled German inflation above 2 percent.
""Based on the continuing low interest (rate) level, it might be obvious to some consumers that savings are increasingly losing value due to inflation,"" Buerkl said.
""A further increase in inflation would certainly dampen the consumer climate.""
The Federal Statistics Office said on Wednesday that rising prices, especially of energy and food, had offset salary increases granted to 17 million employees under collective bargaining agreements in the second quarter, when inflation was 2 percent. 
MORE FISCAL STIMULUS NEEDED?
Since taking office in March, the coalition government has been looking at ways to boost consumers' purchasing power.
It approved 10 billion euros a year of tax relief for families in June and on Tuesday agreed measures to stabilize the level of retirement pensions and reduce workers' contributions to the unemployment insurance system.
ING Diba analyst Carsten Brzeski estimated the measures constituted a combined fiscal stimulus of some 0.4 percent of national output.
But given the government has enjoyed a budget surplus since 2014, it had the means to inject a larger stimulus into the economy, notably via higher investments in infrastructure, digitization and programs to bring more women into the workforce.
The government agreed to cut the unemployment insurance contribution rate by 0.5 percentage point to 2.5 percent starting in 2019. But the health ministry wants to raise contributions to the nursing care insurance system by the same amount.
Still, economists expect consumption to continue supporting the economy as exports wane. 

The GfK survey found that the propensity to buy remained relatively high, Buerkl said, pointing to a booming labor market, record-low unemployment and increased job security.

Shop prices edged up by 0.1 percent in year-on-year terms, ending a run of 63 months of falling prices, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said, citing the impact of a hot, dry summer on food prices and higher international oil costs.
Britain's widely followed consumer price index stood at 2.5 percent in July. But competition among supermarkets and pressure from online retailers has generally pushed down prices in shops.
While retailers were trying to keep a lid on increases, inflationary pressures would grow if Britain fails to secure a deal to smooth its exit from the European Union in seven months' time, BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
""If that does happen retailers will not be able to shield consumers from price increases.""
The value of the pound has fallen since April on concern among investors about the risk of a no-deal Brexit which could cause delays at borders and hamper the broader economy.
The BRC said food prices picked up speed to rise by an annual 1.9 percent in August while non-food deflation eased to 1.0 percent, the weakest fall since April 2013.

The Bank of England this month increased interest rates for only the second time since the global financial crisis, saying the plunge in Britain's unemployment rate would create inflation pressure, even as the economy grows only slowly.

The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence increased to 133.4 this month, compared to a reading of 126.7 forecast by economists. That was its highest level since October 2000.
The measure had climbed to 127.9 in the previous month which was an upward revision from the initial reading of 127.4.
The Present Situation Index improved from 166.1 to 172.2, while the Expectations Index increased from 102.4 last month to 107.6 this month.
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
The cutoff date for the preliminary results was Aug. 17.
Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, noted the improvements in the outlook across the board and highlighted that expectations, which had declined in June and July, bounced back in August and continue to suggest solid economic growth for the remainder of 2018.
“Overall, these historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending in the near-term,” Franco commented."

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the goods trade gap surged 6.3 percent to $72.2 billion last month. Exports of goods dropped 1.7 percent to $140.0 billion, weighed down by a 6.7 percent plunge in shipments of food, feeds and beverages. 
That likely reflected a continued reversal of soybean exports after farmers front-loaded shipments of the crop in April and May to China before Beijing's retaliatory tariffs came into effect in early July. The United States and China are embroiled in a trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs.
Last month, there were also decreases in exports of capital and consumer goods, though motor vehicle exports rose. Imports of goods increased 0.9 percent to $212.2 billion in July, boosted by imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods.
There were also increases in motor vehicle imports, but imports of consumer goods fell.
The U.S. government reported last month that trade contributed 1.06 percentage points to the economy's 4.1 percent annualized growth pace in the second quarter. 
Despite the anticipated drag from trade, economic growth in the July-September quarter is still likely to remain solid.
The Commerce Department also reported on Tuesday that wholesale inventories jumped 0.7 percent in July and stocks at retailers increased 0.4 percent, suggesting inventories could provide a boost to gross domestic product this quarter.

There was an outright inventory liquidation in the second quarter. As a result inventories subtracted a full percentage point from GDP growth in the April-June quarter.

Lending growth to non-financial corporations expanded by 4.1 percent in July while household lending growth was steady at 3.0 - in both cases the best reading since 2009. 
Purchasing 2.6 trillion euros worth of debt over nearly four years, the ECB has held down borrowing costs to stimulate lending and rekindle growth and inflation.
While its efforts have mostly paid off, economic growth has softened this year and the expansion in lending has also appeared to level off, suggesting that the bloc's growth cycle has peaked.
Still, with unemployment dropping and the threat of deflation warded off, the ECB announced in June that it would end the bond purchases by the end of the year, satisfied that growth will be sustained even with more modest help. 
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, which in part reflects the amount of cash pumped in by the ECB itself, eased to 4.0 percent from 4.5 percent a month earlier, short of expectations for 4.3 percent.

The Confederation of British Industry said its quarterly survey of service-sector sentiment sank to -4 from +14 for firms providing services in areas such as computing, consultancy and telecoms, and costs rose at the fastest pace since August 2008.
Consumer-facing businesses did better, after optimism recovered to an above-average +7 in the three months to August from a dip to -11 in May, though their profits were squeezed by rising costs too.
""Demand growth is expected to remain subdued next quarter and firms seem hesitant over the prospects for expanding their businesses in the year ahead,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
""The government and Brussels need to get on with ... agreeing a new relationship between the UK and the EU that puts people's livelihoods above politics,"" she added.
Official data showed Britain's services sector stagnated in June, and recorded only modest annual growth of 1.5 percent.

Last week Britain's Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, said he was confident of securing an interim deal with the European Union before Britain leaves in March 2019, but warned of red tape, border delays and costlier credit card fees without one.

1181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>",Early Indicators Show China's Economy Weakening Again in August,"(Bloomberg) -- The earliest indicators for China’s economy show that the pace of expansion slowed for a fourth month in August, highlighting the pressure for the government to push through pro-growth policies.
The data suggest the economy weakened further as demand from trading partners lost steam, with the decline in stock prices reflecting worsening sentiment. That’s according to a Bloomberg Economics gauge aggregating the earliest available indicators on business conditions and market sentiment.
Amid rising fears about a trade war, policy makers have unveiled measures to boost infrastructure construction and credit to smaller firms, as well as tax cuts. Such measures will take time to actually have an effect so the slowdown will probably continue, although analysts are looking at evidence of better sentiment in commodity markets.
It will take at least a few months for the economy to hit bottom and start recovering, according to Bloomberg Chief Asia economist Chang Shu, who doesn’t see any impact of the government’s measures yet. ""It’s like a big ship -- it will take a bit of time to shift its course.""
The first official data for August, the purchasing managers index for manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, will be released Friday at 9 a.m. Both will decline slightly, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
External demand is also less likely to support the economy. U.S tariffs will hit Chinese exports and in addition, there was a deterioration in the weighted average of the flash PMI readings of trade partners including the U.S., the European Union and Japan.
Sentiment worsened on the stock market as the benchmark Shanghai composite index tumbling 5.1 percent this month through Friday. Property developers were among the worst performers, as good sales data prompted worries that policy might be tightened for the sector.
Still, there are some signs of a silver lining. While the three-month weighted average of the  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc index on small and medium enterprises indicates a weakening bias, the August reading rebounded to 56.6 from 55.7.
""Measures to boost SME loans since July seem to be having an effect,"" according to a note from Shen Lan, the Beijing-based Standard Chartered economist in charge of the survey of more than 500 smaller companies. ""Unclogging the monetary policy transmission mechanism and lowering borrowing costs for SMEs remain key to improving financial services for SMEs.""
China’s central bank has reduced the reserve requirement ratio three times this year, partly aiming at channeling funds to smaller companies who struggle to get credit. The performance of smaller exporters weakened amid the trade tensions, while domestically-focused companies strengthened, according to Shen.
With the government ramping up support for infrastructure spending, iron ore prices have rebounded. That pickup in sentiment was also reflected in the surveys Macquarie Securities Ltd. conducted with China-based producers and traders of steel and copper. They point to stabilized demand and better sentiment, according to Larry Hu, a Hong Kong-based economist at the bank.
""We could see infrastructure fixed-asset investment and credit growth bottom out this or next month,"" Hu wrote in a note.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale improved for the first time this year in August as a trade truce between the European Union and United States made company executives less concerned about a transatlantic trade war.
The Ifo economic institute said on Monday its closely-watched business climate index jumped to 103.8, beating July's reading of 101.7 and a Reuters consensus forecast of 101.9.
U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last month to refrain from imposing tariffs on European cars while the two sides negotiate to cut other tariffs.
""The truce between Juncker and Trump is clearly providing relief,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding that export expectations in Europe's largest economy had risen significantly after dropping in July.
The August reading was the highest since February and marked the strongest monthly improvement since December 2014.
Ifo chief Clemens Fuest also cited robust domestic conditions. ""The German economy is performing robustly. Current figures point to economic growth of 0.5 percent in the third quarter,"" he said.
'NO CRISIS'
German companies were once again more satisfied with their current situation and their business expectations were revised noticeably upwards, the survey showed.
The main support came from services and construction, a sector breakdown showed. But business sentiment also improved slightly in manufacturing and retailing.
August's IHS Markit sentiment survey among purchasing managers also showed the private sector shifting into a higher gear, helped by strong services activity.
""The global trade dispute so far hasn't turned out to be a sentiment killer,"" Alexander Krueger from Bankhaus Lampe said. ""Everything is pointing to a continuation of the robust upswing.""
MORE OPTIMISTIC
Ifo's Wohlrabe said the strong domestic situation was also outweighing uncertainty caused by Britain's planned departure from the EU and the Turkish lira crisis. ""We expect full-year economic growth of 1.8 or even 1.9 percent,"" he said.
The German economy grew 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June, helped by construction, state spending and private consumption.
However, a larger-scale trade dispute between the United States and China could also harm Germany, many of whose manufacturers rely on growth in the world's two largest economies.
""Up to now, talks and fears of new crises, trade wars or a sudden end to a mature cycle have only been talks and threats,"" ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said, adding all those concerns had not left any significant marks on the German economy yet.

The economy was set to continue its balancing act between the favorable effects of the European Central Bank's loose monetary policy and a lack of new structural reforms as well as between solid domestic demand and trade frictions, Brzeski said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in July and growth in shipments held firm, signaling that business investment started the third quarter on a strong note.
The Commerce Department said on Friday orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase in June.
""That provides further reason to think that overall GDP has continued to expand at a healthy ... pace,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.
Business spending on equipment is being supported by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January.
But there are worries that trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, could offset the fiscal stimulus.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.4 percent in July after a previously reported 0.2 percent gain in June. Core capital goods orders increased 7.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent gain in June.
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, so the higher estimate for shipments in June could contribute to an upward revision of economic growth in the second quarter.
Yields on U.S. government debt rose modestly after the data, with investors awaiting a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. U.S. stocks were trading higher while the dollar (DXY) was down against a basket of currencies.
Business investment drove about a quarter of economic growth in the second quarter. The economy grew at its fastest pace in the April-June period as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China before retaliatory trade tariffs took effect in early July.
The United States has slapped duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods so far, eliciting the retaliation from Beijing.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 1.7 percent in July as volatile demand for civilian aircraft fell.

In annual terms, the economy expanded 2.6 percent compared with a year earlier. The year-on-year growth was one tenth of a point less than had been predicted in the preliminary estimate, which was published at the end of July.
A breakdown of the data showed that primary activities such as agriculture contracted by 2.1 percent quarter-on-quarter, with industrial production, including manufacturing, slipping by 0.3 percent. By contrast, service activity grew 0.2 percent.
Mexico's central bank said early this month it believes economic growth will likely come in at the lower end of its forecast for expansion of between 2 and 3 percent this year.

Separately, the statistics agency said the economy contracted by 0.1 percent month-on-month in June.

BERLIN/HAMBURG (Reuters) - All sectors of the German economy grew in the second quarter, data showed, with robust domestic activity helping to cushion against risks to exports from an uncertain global trade outlook.
Construction and state spending expanded the most, both up 0.6 percent quarter on quarter - but the head of one economic institute said a record public sector surplus meant government investments should be rising more rapidly.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz cautiously agreed, saying the surplus created ""further possibilities"" though the precise extent of them would not become apparent until the end of the year.
His remarks could cheer critics who have until now been disappointed in their hopes that the Social Democrat would follow a looser fiscal course than his conservative predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble, a reluctant spender who was dead set against new debt.
Friday's Federal Statistics Office figures, which matched a preliminary overall growth reading of 0.5 percent, confirmed the increasing reliance of Europe's largest economy on domestic drivers.
""It's a good development (offering) further possibilities,"" Scholz said in Hamburg after meeting finance ministers from fellow German-speaking countries Austria, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. He added that he would see at the end of the year exactly how much extra wiggle room had been created.
Private consumption extended its growth run to six straight quarters, reflecting steady falls in unemployment during what has been a long phase of economic recovery.
That surge has fueled criticism of Berlin by its euro zone partners for not helping their economies by spending more of its budget surplus on investments.
Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba said Friday's data should help counter that view. ""Defying the often-heard international criticism, the economy is already showing a very balanced growth model,"" he wrote in a note to clients. It had delivered ""a full strike"", with all sectors growing.
But after the data also showed the overall public sector surplus soared to a record high of 48.1 billion euros ($55.0 billion) in the first half of the year, the president of the DIW economics institute added his voice to the calls for more investments.
""The massive surplus and tax revenues for the government are a source of envy,"" Marcel Fratzscher wrote on Twitter. ""A smart investment offensive in infrastructure, education and innovation is necessary.""
BLUE SKIES FOR NOW
Other critics say that, given the less robust export sector, the government should also approve tax relief for families beyond the 10 billion euros a year it granted in June.
""The state needs to give taxpayers something back. The middle class needs to have more money in its pockets,"" Bavarian state Premier Markus Soeder told the RND newspaper group.
Germany's economy has traditionally been dominated by exports. That sector's prominence has declined in recent quarters, and trade disputes between the United States and many of its largest commercial partners, including the European Union, risk diminishing its influence further.
Stefan Kipar of BayernLB said he saw no signs of that yet, however. ""It's encouraging to see that investments did not decline. And we don't see an export weakness,"" he wrote in a note to clients.
Imports rose 1.7 percent in the second quarter while exports gained 0.7 percent, resulting in net trade deducting 0.4 percentage points from growth.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, agreed last month to defer imposing levies on cars imported from the bloc while the two sides negotiate over other trade issues.

A larger-scale trade dispute between the United States and China could also harm Germany, many of whose manufacturers rely on growth in the world's two largest economies.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in July from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous month's gain, adding to evidence the central bank is making little headway in achieving its elusive 2 percent price target.
Subdued wage and price growth have forced the BOJ to extend its massive stimulus program despite the rising risks of the policy, such as the hit to bank profits from near-zero rates.
The BOJ last month conceded that inflation will miss its elusive 2 percent target until early 2021 and took steps to make its policy framework more sustainable.
The rise in the nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil prices but excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell slightly short of a median market forecast for a 0.9 percent gain.
""Consumer price gains remain driven by volatile fresh food and energy inflation while underlying inflation remains subdued,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Price pressures should strengthen ahead of next year's sales tax hike but inflation is set to remain well below the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.""
The so-called core-core inflation index, a more closely watched gauge the BOJ uses to strip away the effect of both energy and fresh food costs, was up 0.3 percent year-on-year in July after rising 0.2 percent in June, government data showed on Friday.
The data underscores the challenge the central bank faces in eradicating an entrenched deflationary mindset that discourages firms from raising prices for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive consumers.
""The BOJ will likely maintain its zero percent target for 10-year government bond yields for the time being to support the economy and prices,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Wage growth remains key. While intensifying labor shortages force companies to hike hourly pay for temporary workers, they remain reluctant to raise permanent workers' salaries for fear of incurring higher fixed costs.
Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in the first three months of this year thanks to robust household and business spending.

Real wages rose at their fastest pace in more than 21 years in June, thanks mostly to higher bonus payments, offering policymakers some hope that consumption will gain momentum and encourage firms to raise prices.

Key Takeaways
Japan’s drawn-out quest to spur inflation has prompted the central bank to tweak its policy settings, a nod to the mounting side effects its aggressive stimulus is having on financial institutions and market functioning. The BOJ also lowered its inflation outlook last month and promised to keep extremely low interest rates in place for an extended period of time, giving little impression that major progress is on the horizon. While it ticked up in July, deceleration in previous months of the inflation gauge that excludes fresh food and energy shows that underlying price pressures remain soft.

The ratio of bids to the amount offered <9128284H0=> was 2.78, up from 2.55 at the prior five-year TIPS auction in April. <US5YTIPINV=RR>
Investor demand for TIPS has been improving as the government's consumer price index, its broadest inflation measure, climbed at its fastest year-over-year pace since January 2012 in July.
On the other hand, the market's inflation outlook has softened on worries about a possible drag on global economic growth from escalating trade conflicts between the United States and its major trading partners, analysts said.
Still, the latest U.S. TIPS auction signaled investor appetite for this type of bond as their yields have risen. That meant less pressure on primary dealers, or the top 23 Wall Street firms, to buy a heavy chunk of the five-year TIPS supply.
""Looks like the Street got what it needed, so we don't expect anyone to come and chase it,"" Jefferies & Co.'s money market strategist Tom Simons wrote in a research note.
On the open market, the yield on five-year TIPS <US5YTIP=TWEB> was 0.726 percent, down 0.7 basis point from late on Wednesday, Tradeweb data showed.
The spread between five-year TIPS and regular five-year Treasury notes <US5YT=TWEB> was 1.98 percent, up more than 1 basis point on the day. On Tuesday, it declined as low as 1.94 percent, which was the lowest since Feb. 13.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, a sign the labor market was holding firm despite tensions between the United States and its trading partners that have led to tit-for-tat tariffs.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Aug. 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
It was the third straight week of declines for claims, which have dropped so low that economists have scrambled for explanations. In July, claims fell to their lowest level since 1969 even though the workforce is much larger than in prior decades. 
Economists polled by Reuters ahead of Thursday's report had forecast claims rising to 215,000 in the latest week.
""At this rate, we will be talking about a new low again pretty soon,"" said Stephen Stanley​, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading slightly higher while U.S. stock prices were mixed. The dollar (DXY) was stronger against a basket of currencies.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showing a fall in sales of new homes gave fresh indications of a cooling U.S. housing market.
But the strength in the U.S. labor market has been a key reason behind the Federal Reserve's ongoing campaign to raise interest rates. 
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's last policy meeting, published on Wednesday, showed officials discussed raising rates soon to counter excessive economic strength, although policymakers also examined how global trade disputes could batter businesses and households.
The Fed has already raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again in September.
The claims data is being closely watched for signs of layoffs as a result of the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has led to an escalating trade war with China and tit-for-tat import tariffs with trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
While there have been reports of some companies either laying off workers or planning to as a result of the import duties, that is not yet evident in the claims data. 
Thursday's claims report showed ""no sign of disruption in the U.S. economy despite recent trade policy tensions,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist with J.P. Morgan.
Economists say a robust economy is helping the labor market weather the trade storm. 
The Labor Department said data for Maine were estimated in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, dropped 1,750 last week to 213,750.

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 2,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Aug. 11. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 5,000 to 1.74 million.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales decreased 1.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000 units last month, the lowest level since October 2017. June's sales pace was revised up to 638,000 units from the previously reported 631,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10 percent of housing market sales, rising to a pace of 645,000 units in July.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They increased 12.8 percent from a year ago. Housing market data has weakened in recent months, with home resales declining in July for a fourth straight month.
The sector has been plagued by rising building material costs and shortages of land and labor, which have put a squeeze on the supply of houses available for sale and kept house prices elevated.
Though the moderation in housing is largely driven by supply constraints, there are concerns that persistent weakness will eventually spill over to the broader economy. The housing market has underperformed the economy so far this year.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, declined 3.3 percent in July. Sales rose 10.9 percent in the West and 9.9 percent in the Midwest. They tumbled 52.3 percent in the Northeast to their lowest level since September 2015.
The median new house price rose 6.0 percent to $328,700 in July from June. There were 309,000 new homes on the market in July, the most since March 2009 and up 2.0 percent from June.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","ECB minutes point to worries about trade war, protectionism","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Protectionism and the threat of a global trade war are the biggest risks to the euro zone economy but growth for now remains firmly on the path seen earlier, European Central Bank policymakers concluded last month.
In a meeting with few if any disagreements, rate setters shared the view that the bloc was performing as expected so no tweak to policy was needed, the minutes of the July 26 meeting showed on Thursday.
The ECB agreed in June to end lavish bond buys by the close of the year and to keep rates steady at least through next summer, giving markets unusually long notice for its likely policy moves. 
""Uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent, in particular with regard to the threat of protectionism and the risk of an escalation of trade tensions,"" the minutes showed.
""Tensions could generate a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any directs effects from the imposition of tariffs,"" the ECB added.
While the risk of a trade war is already weighing on sentiment, the actual impact on growth has so far been muted and ECB policymaker said they even expect the first half's growth slowdown to be temporary.
The euro zone is enjoying its sixth year of expansion, record high employment and solid prospects as growth is now fueled by domestic consumption, including on the bloc's periphery.
Even inflation is on the rise, though policymakers disagree whether a 1.7 percent rate projected for the next three years is in line or below the ECB's target price growth close to but below 2 percent.
""Members broadly shared the view that uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook had been receding,"" the ECB said. 
Followed by one of the shortest ECB press conferences on record, the meeting did not consider any policy alternatives and rate setters unanimously agreed to reconfirm the current stance. 
""It was considered essential to regain sufficient flexibility and optionality for monetary policy,"" the ECB said. ""It was considered prudent to restate the Governing Council's readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate.""

With a policy path laid down for the next year, the ECB has few big decisions coming up. Still, it will have to make a formal decision, possibly in September or October, to end the bond buys as its decision has so far been described as an expectation.

The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly retail sales gauge rose to +29 in August from +20 in June. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a fall to +13.
Despite a strong August, the CBI said retailers were downbeat about the outlook.
The survey's quarterly balance for employment expectations sank to its lowest level since late 2009, when Britain was still reeling from the global financial crisis.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's summer shutdown kept euro zone business growth on ice this month as activity picked up less than expected, while prospects of a growing trade war clouded the outlook, a survey showed on Thursday.
Survey compiler IHS Markit cautioned the August data were based on a much smaller sample size than usual, particularly amongst manufacturers where there were about half the normal number of respondents for some countries.
""Always treat August data with some caution for the euro zone, especially in core countries such as France, Italy and Spain, where factories go through lengthy closures. Less so in Germany,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, nudged up in August to 54.4 from 54.3, coming in just below a median forecast in a Reuters poll for 54.5. A number above 50 indicates growth.
So although growth remained somewhat sluggish, August's results are unlikely to upset policymakers at the European Central Bank who intend to close their 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program by year-end.
""August's small increase in the euro zone PMI suggests that the region's economy is performing well in Q3, which will reassure the ECB that it is right to be normalizing monetary policy very gradually,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
IHS Markit said the PMIs indicate GDP growth this quarter at around 0.4 percent, matching a forecast in a Reuters poll.
This year and next the euro zone economy will only muddle through, with steady but modest growth in a slowdown from 2017, according to economists in a Reuters poll on Wednesday, which showed a majority expecting a brewing U.S.-led trade war to hold back expansion. [ECILT/EU]
Germany's services sector continues to provide a temporary cushion to the economy against a cooling trend in manufacturing, confirming the vulnerability of the world's export champion to rising trade frictions, earlier data showed.
In France, the only other euro zone country to publish flash data, activity grew in August, beating forecasts, as a faster expansion of the country's services and manufacturing sectors helped the bloc's second-biggest economy bounce back from recent signs of a slowdown.
CLOUDS GATHERING
However, the future output index - which measures optimism - sank to a near two-year low of 61.3 from 63.1. That suggests businesses were not hopeful there would be an acceleration anytime soon. 
""Concerns about activity in the coming months remain,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. ""While the meeting between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and U.S. President Trump has brought the trade conflict into calmer waters, businesses have not taken that as a reason to be optimistic."" 
In a further sign of wavering optimism, factories kept their stocks of purchases - the amount of raw materials they hold - at the same level as in July. The sub-index was right on the break-even 50 mark, down from 52 and its lowest in a year.
There was only a modest revival among firms operating in the bloc's dominant service industry. The services PMI rose to 54.4 from July's 54.2, matching expectations in a Reuters poll but a far cry from levels seen at the turn of the year.
They did increase headcount though at the fastest rate since October 2007 - before the financial crisis really hit - but the employment index tends to be a lagging index. It jumped to 55.1 from 54.6.
Factory growth decelerated much faster than expected. The manufacturing PMI fell to a 21-month low of 54.6 from July's 55.1, matching the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll.

An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, nudged up to 54.5 from 54.4.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 06:18AM ET</span>",Foreigners cool on U.S. Treasuries as supply heats up,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign investors are showing signs of fatigue in absorbing the supply of Treasuries that is growing due to the U.S. government's ballooning budget gap, posing a risk that bond yields will eventually spike.
The rising stockpile of federal debt to finance a U.S. deficit that is projected to hit $1 trillion in two years has stoked concerns whether overseas appetite for it is approaching saturation. 
Signs of waning enthusiasm from this major group of Treasuries holders have yet to hurt the $15 trillion Treasuries market, analysts said. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes has struggled to stay above the 3 percent mark since hitting a near-seven-year peak in May.
""That will be a powerful force for U.S. yields to go up,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global strategist at Invesco in New York. 
In July, overseas accounts acquired the fewest fixed-rate government debt issues at auctions since at least 2009, according to Reuters' calculation of Treasury auction data.
Foreigners' reticence means the government would rely more on domestic banks, fund managers and Wall Street dealers to buy its debt to keep Treasury yields from marching much higher this year.
""Incrementally, foreigners are buying fewer Treasuries, but domestic investors have stepped up and filled in for that group,"" said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Minneapolis.
Recent safe-haven demand for Treasuries stemming from trade frictions between the United States and China and other nations, and political concerns about Turkey and Italy have kept a lid on bond yields, analysts said. 
On Wednesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was 2.82 percent after peaking near 3.13 percent in 
mid-May to its highest in seven years. 
(Graphic: Fund managers, foreign buying at U.S. Treasury auctions: https://reut.rs/2PsyZ7l)
OVERSEAS DEMAND RECEDES
Foreigners' share of monthly fixed-rate Treasury supply at auction has retreated since the Treasury began ramping up its issuance after the suspension of its statutory debt limit in February. Also, hedging costs for overseas buyers have risen due to an unexpected resurgence in the dollar in the second quarter.
In July, they bought $16.57 billion worth of monthly fixed-rate government bond supply, marking the lowest amount of fixed-rate issuance they purchased going back to at least 2009.
The U.S. Treasury Department sold $170 billion in two-, three-, five-, seven-, 10- and 30-year debt last month.
In June, foreign investors turned net sellers of Treasuries, shedding $48.57 billion, Treasury data released last Thursday showed.
China's holdings of U.S. government debt slipped to $1.179 trillion in June, the lowest since February, while Japan's ownership of Treasuries decreased to $1.030 trillion in June, the lowest since October 2011.
China and Japan are the two largest foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries. 
Moreover, Japanese investors sold a net 455.8 billion yen ($4.09 billion) of U.S. bonds in June, after selling a net 2.071 trillion yen in May, Japanese government data showed. 
Holding U.S. Treasuries has become more expensive for Japanese and other overseas fund managers due to higher costs to hedge against the dollar.
A stronger domestic currency makes it less appealing to own U.S. bonds, although the dollar has rebounded from its broad weakness earlier this year.
Still, higher yields offered by U.S. bonds remain compelling for European and Japanese investors, analysts say.
The U.S. 10-year yield was almost 2.50 percentage points higher than comparable European yields and about 2.75 percentage points above its Japanese counterpart, Reuters data showed.
(Graphic: G5 10-year yields: https://reut.rs/2LjQMul) 
CHINA'S ""NUCLEAR OPTION"" 
Analysts said a solid August government refunding signals ample demand for Treasuries as domestic fund managers have stepped up purchases of U.S. government debt and foreigners bought more longer-dated Treasuries.
Last month, U.S. bond managers bought $92.05 billion of fixed-rate Treasuries issued by the government. This accounted for 54 percent of the total supply, which was the most ever.
Much of the increase in Treasury supply has been among short-to-medium-term maturities, which appeal to domestic buyers, analysts said.
A nagging worry, however, is whether Beijing would dump its bond holdings as retaliation in its trade conflict with Washington.
""China is holding its nuclear option. They can sell some of their U.S. debt holding,"" Invesco's Hooper said.
There have been no signs that China is slashing its Treasuries ownership since the Trump administration began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in a bid to push the world's second biggest economy to address its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States.
Chinese and U.S. trade officials will hold lower-level talks on Aug. 22-23. 
It is unclear if U.S. mutual and pension funds, and banks and insurers, could keep pace with the increase in Treasury issuance if foreign demand continues to fall. 
""We might have enough buyers today, but will we have enough four months from now?"" Hooper said.

The preliminary reading of the Markit euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index slid to a 21-month low of 54.6 this month from 55.1 in July. Economists had forecast an unchanged reading.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The services PMI ticked up to a two month high of 54.4 from 54.2 a month earlier, in line with expectations.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors also edged up to a two month high, rising to 54.4 from 54.3. Economists had expected the composite index to tick up to 54.5.
Although growth rates improved slightly in manufacturing and services, both remained among the weakest seen for at least one-and-a-half years.
A particularly sluggish performance was seen in manufacturing, where new export orders registered the smallest monthly increase in two years.
Employment growth hit a six-month high, but while service sector jobs growth struck the highest since October 2007, factory payroll growth slipped to a 17-month low.
Future expectations of business activity meanwhile deteriorated to a 23-month low, slumping to a 34- month low in manufacturing and a 21-month low in the service sector. Optimism was subdued by recent signs of cooling demand, higher prices and rising political concerns.
“The survey data indicate that the euro zone economy looks to have continued to grow at a steady rate in August, raising hopes that the third quarter could see GDP growth match the 0.4% expansion seen in the second quarter. In fact, the survey evidence suggests that the official data so far this year could yet be revised slightly higher,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
“Escalating political worries, rising prices and a recent slowdown in order book growth have all contributed to the gloomiest outlook for almost two years, according to companies’ expectations of their future output. In manufacturing, optimism is down to its lowest for almost three years, as a nearstalling of exports corroborated escalating trade war worries.”"

IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to a six-month high reading of 55.7 in August from 55.0 in July. 
An index measuring manufacturing activity fell to 56.1 from 56.9 in July, the lowest reading in two months. The index for services rose to a six-month high of 55.2 from 54.1.
The figures reflected a cooling trend in the manufacturing sector that started this year after an all-time high reading in December 2017.
Economists attribute this partly to the increasingly protectionist policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, which have clouded the outlook for Germany's export-dependent manufacturers.
The German economy, Europe's largest, has been relying on private consumption and government spending for growth.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said if the cooling trend in manufacturing is not reversed, the slowdown would soon spread to the services sector.
""We do think the weakening manufacturing trend will continue, unless of course there is a turnaround in new orders,"" he said. ""The question is: how long will the services sector remain robust in the face of the deteriorating manufacturing trend?""
He added: ""History tells us that when manufacturing turns down services sooner or later follow it down.""
In addition to trade worries, the outlook for German manufacturers is being clouded by the currency crisis in Turkey, which contributed to weaker growth in new export orders, Williamson said.
IHS Markit expect the German economy to expand by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, on a par with the growth rate recorded in the April-June period.
""While the manufacturing PMI retreated slightly, it remained well inside growth territory at the mid-point in the third quarter,"" said Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit.
""The top-line number is perhaps flattered by the output component, with trends in new orders and exports - the latter the weakest in over two years - pointing to a softer pace of growth.""

The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors also rose to a six month high, climbing to 55.7 from 55.0. Economists had expected the composite index to tick up to 55.2.
“German business continued to display remarkable resilience during August, with the latest PMI data going some way to dispel any fears about a global trade slowdown and its impact on the health of the economy,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at survey compiler Markit.
“Buoyed by strong fundamentals in the domestic market, including rising employment and wages, the service sector enjoyed an upturn in growth in August and drove the steepest rise in private sector business activity for six months.”
Stronger demand in the service sector offset the loss of momentum recorded in manufacturing, with total inflows of new business rising at the quickest rate since February.
It was a similar picture on the employment front, where the overall rate of job creation picked up to the fastest for seven months.
The report also pointed to an intensification of inflationary pressures across the German economy.

The preliminary reading of the Markit services purchasing managers’ index rose to a two month high of 55.7 from 54.9 in July. Economists had forecast a reading of 55.1.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The manufacturing PMI rose to a three month high of 53.7 from 53.3 a month earlier, against expectations for 53.5.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, rose to 55.1 from 54.4. It was the highest reading in four months. Economists had expected the composite index to tick up to 54.6.
“Output growth across the French private sector ticked up to a four-month high in August, with both the service and manufacturing sectors seeing stronger expansions,” said Sam Teague, economist at survey compiler Markit.
“Robust domestic client demand, alongside a renewed upturn in exports provided stimulus for the latest acceleration in growth.”"
1204,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 08:48PM ET</span>","Japan August flash manufacturing PMI rises on domestic demand, exports weak","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in August as domestic demand jumped, a preliminary survey showed on Thursday, but export orders contracted, adding to worries about rising trade protectionism.
The flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.5 in August on a seasonally adjusted basis from a final 52.3 in July.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 24th consecutive month.
""August flash data extended the current growth cycle in Japan's manufacturing sector to two years, the longest uninterrupted stretch of expansion since the global financial crisis,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""That said, with export orders declining, this signaled that the latest expansionary PMI reading was underpinned by strength in the domestic market."" 
The preliminary index for new orders rose to 52.6 from 50.9 in the previous month, highlighting the strength of domestic demand.
However, the flash index for new export orders fell to 49.3 from a final 50.0 in July to show the first contraction in two months.
Japan's economy grew more than expected in the second quarter, helped by strong household and business spending in a sign that domestic demand is gathering strength.
Real wages rose in June at the fastest pace in more than 21 years, which has also added to hopes that consumer spending will continue to rise.

There are still concerns that trade disputes with the United States will hurt demand for exports, which poses a serious risk to Japan's manufacturing sector, economists say.

Wage data provider XpertHR said the median annual pay award had fallen to 2.3 percent, compared with 2.5 percent over the three months to June.
Still, XpertHR said the data were finely balanced, as a couple of extra pay deals worth either more or less than 2.3 percent could have pushed July's figure back up to 2.5 percent or down to 2.0 percent.
The figures are likely to interest officials at the Bank of England, which has repeatedly downgraded its forecasts for wage growth after pay growth failed to accelerate significantly.
Official data last week showed total annual wage growth slowed to a nine-month low of 2.4 percent in the three months to June, below forecasts for it to hold at 2.5 percent, even though the unemployment rate fell to a new 43-year low of 4.0 percent.

XpertHR said it sampled 51 pay awards in the three months to July -- a relatively quiet time of the year since most annual pay rounds take place in the first four months of the year.

""Fed staff continued to project that the economy would expand at an above-trend pace,"" the minutes showed. ""Members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.""
In a sign of confidence on the strength of the U.S. economy, Fed policymakers raised their outlook on U.S. economy growth, citing stronger household spending.
""Relative to the forecast prepared for the June meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger incoming data on household spending,"" the minutes said.
The Fed modestly downgraded its outlook on inflation, which was hurt by falling oil prices, but policymakers remained adamant that inflation would remain near the central bank's 2% objective.
""The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 was revised down a little, mainly because of a slower-than-expected increase in consumer energy prices in the second quarter and a downward revision to the forecast for energy price inflation in the second half of this year,"" the minutes showed. ""The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020.""
International trade tensions, meanwhile, had ""weighed"" on market sentiment, prompting ""notable"" declines in some foreign equity markets, although the impact on domestic asset prices was modest, Fed members said.
The minutes gave traders further confidence in a September rate hike. The change of a hike at the next meeting rose to 96%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. But the chance of a December hike edged down to 62.8% from 64.5%.
The Fed's plan to continue with rate hikes has recently drawn criticism from President Donald Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump said that he was “not thrilled” with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates and added that the Fed should do more to help him to boost the economy.
The president also said he would criticize the Fed if it continues to raise rates.
This is not the first time Trump has called out the Fed for raising rates. When he did so in July, Powell stressed that the Fed operated independently of political considerations.
Trump nominated Powell to succeed former Fed Chief Janet Yellen earlier this year.
The minutes had little impact on today's indecisive market. The S&P 500 pinged higher right after their release, only to quickly fall back down to around the unchanged mark."

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday existing home sales fell 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million units last month. July's drop marked the longest streak of monthly declines since 2013.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would gain 0.6 percent to a rate of 5.40 million units in July. Sales fell across the Northeast, South and Midwest, but rose in the West.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, fell 1.5 percent from a year ago in July. Sales have been stymied by an acute shortages of homes on the market for several months, although the NAR said inventory showed signs of stabilizing last month.
There were 1.92 million homes on the market in July, unchanged from a year earlier. It was the first month in three years in which inventory did not fall on a year-on-year basis, said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.
Rising building materials costs as well as shortages of land and labor have left builders unable to bridge the inventory gap, pushing up house prices. Supply constraints have largely accounted for the sluggish housing market, but there are growing concerns that the higher house prices together with rising mortgage rates will slow demand.
At July's sales pace, it would take 4.3 months to exhaust the current inventory. A supply of six to seven months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 

The median house price increased 4.5 percent from a year ago to $269,600 in July.

Economists had forecast a 0.6% increase to an annualized pace of 5.44 million.
Existing home sales account for 90% of the market and are calculated when a contract closes.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer sentiment hits 11-month low, inflation in focus","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell to an 11-month low in early August, with households expressing concerns about the rising cost of living, potentially signaling a slowdown in consumer spending.
The University of Michigan on Friday said its consumer sentiment index fell to a reading of 95.3 early this month, the weakest since September 2017, from 97.9 in July. The survey's current conditions sub-index of consumer expectations dropped to 107.8 from July's reading of 114.4.
It said the decline in sentiment was concentrated among households in the bottom third of the income distribution, adding that consumers' views on prices for big-ticket household goods were the least favorable in nearly 10 years. 
Inflation has been rising in recent months, driven in part by strong domestic demand and a labor market that is viewed as being near or at full employment. 
Economists said some of the consumers' unease with pricey goods could be linked to the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has led to an escalation of a trade war between the United States and China as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with the European Union, Canada and Mexico. 
The import duties are seen driving up prices.
""The decline (in sentiment) suggests at face value that the recent escalation of trade tensions may be worrying some consumers,"" said Andrew Hunter, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But the details suggest that the bigger factor has been the recent rise in inflation.""
The consumer price index increased 2.9 percent year-on-year in July, matching June's gain, which was the largest rise since February 2012. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.9 percent in June. 
The core PCE price index hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since December 2011. 
DRAG ON SPENDING
According to the University of Michigan, consumers' perceptions of conditions for purchasing large long-lasting household goods were the least favorable in nearly four years. Their views on motor vehicle prices were the worst since 1984.
""Consumers are paying attention and they aren't happy that prices are rising, particularly on higher ticket items like cars and houses,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""At the margins, that's likely to drag on spending.""
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next five years rose 2.5 percent early this month from 2.4 percent in July.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity increased at a 4.0 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. That helped to lift gross domestic product growth to a 4.1 percent rate, the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter. 
The University of Michigan survey also showed consumers' perceptions about home buying conditions were the least favorable in 10 years and their views on house prices were the worst since 2006. This is bad news for the housing market, which has underperformed the strong economy.
The housing market is being stymied by an acute shortage of properties available for sale, which has driven up home prices. House prices have risen more than 6 percent on an annual basis, far outpacing wage growth, which has been stuck below 3 percent.

""Today's report showed that consumers perceive themselves to be worse off financially currently as a result of affordability issues related to big ticket consumer items and housing,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.

LONDON (Reuters) - More evidence that euro zone growth has slowed this year is likely to be seen on Thursday, when surveys are expected to show an escalating global trade war is hurting producers.
The currency bloc was a surprise economic star last year, outpacing its peers, but the rate of expansion is steadily slowing and a succession of Reuters polls have said it has already peaked -- although a recession is seen as unlikely. 
Protectionist policies on trade are likely to tap the brakes significantly on global growth and have already caused turmoil in financial markets. 
Manufacturers have been spooked by the escalating trade war between the United States and its trading partners although reports China is to send a delegation to Washington for discussions may allay some of those fears.
Thursday's composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone, compiled by IHS Markit, will be the first gauge of the economy's health in August. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and if the 54.3 forecast in a Reuters poll for a composite PMI is realized it will confirm growth remains robust but is far weaker than the decade-high pace witnessed earlier this year. reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=EUPMCF%3DECI reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=****%3DECI
""European growth momentum is losing steam. (But) We only expect a small setback compared to last month, despite relatively weak European financial markets so far in August,"" Nordea economists said. 
With growth holding strong and inflation confirmed above the European Central Bank's target in July, ECB policymakers are unlikely to go back on plans to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond buying program this year.
They are expected to begin raising borrowing costs in the second half of 2019.
Across the Atlantic, where growth has also already peaked, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been tightening policy and is expected to plow ahead with planned interest rate hikes. It is alone among peers in carrying on with a tightening campaign, which has driven the dollar sharply higher. 
The Bank of England raised interest rates earlier this month, above financial crisis lows, but signaled it was in no hurry to raise them further.
Trade fears in Britain are focused on what deal it can strike with the European Union before leaving the bloc at the end of March. If no agreement is struck, market watchers expect sterling to fall and growth to slow further.
IN THE HOLE
Central bankers meet at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole from Thursday and while the agenda has yet to be released, no big policy pronouncements are expected. 
""However, there is always headline risk at these events, especially with media interviews of policymakers. In our view, the risk is likely two-way,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economists wrote to clients. 
""FOMC members could stress that they intend to hike faster than market expectations, or just as easily focus on global growth and the risks of a strong dollar."" 
Trade war concerns are likely to feature heavily in discussions among the central bankers.
A Chinese delegation will meet U.S. representatives, China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that talks will take place in Washington on Aug. 21 and 22.
The world's two largest economies are due to slap tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods on Thursday, in addition to levies that took effect on July 6.
""There is still a great deal of difference between agreeing to talk and coming to an agreement,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.

""For now it appears an escalation has become less likely, hence yesterday's rebound in equity markets,"" he added, referring to an overnight rally on Wall Street.

Analysts had forecast a rise to 98.1.
The current conditions indicator fell to 107.8 in August, from the previous 114.4.
Additionally, consumer expectations held steady at 87.3.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months held steady at 2.9%, while the five-year gauge increased to 2.5% from 2.4%.
The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin indicated that the decline was concentrated among households in the bottom third of the income distribution.
“The dominating weakness reflected much less favorable assessments of buying conditions, mainly due to less favorable perceptions of market prices,” he added.
Curtin pointed out that consumers held unfavorable views on buying conditions for large household durables and vehicles. 
“The data suggest that consumers have become much more sensitive to even relatively low inflation rates than in past decades,” this economist noted, adding that the falloff in favorable price perceptions was much larger than ever before recorded. 
“Overall, the data indicate that consumers have little tolerance for overshooting inflation targets, and to the benefit of the Fed, interest rates now play a more decisive role in purchase decisions,” Curtin concluded."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated to 3.0 percent in July from 2.5 percent in June as energy prices climbed, raising expectations that the Bank of Canada might raise interest rates further as soon as next month.
The inflation rate was much stronger than the 2.5 percent forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. The Bank of Canada, which raised interest rates in July for the fourth time in a year, has an inflation target of 2.0 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers was at its highest in seven months in August thanks to a firm global economy, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, but the service sector's mood hit its lowest since 2016, casting doubt on the robustness of domestic demand.
The mixed results of the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan quarterly survey, underscore the fragility of an economy that has emerged from a first-quarter contraction.
The Reuters Tankan found manufacturers' sentiment was expected to rise further over the coming three months despite concerns over global trade tensions and market turmoil stemming from some emerging economies.
Service-sector sentiment is also expected to recover from August's deterioration, which was caused in part by abnormal weather such as the flooding rains and heat waves that struck various parts of Japan this summer. 
In the Reuters poll of 483 large- and mid-sized companies, some exporters of cars and machinery makers expressed concerns over trade tensions between the United States and China and other trading partners.
""The effects of punitive U.S. tariffs against China are a matter of concern for us as well,"" a manager of a transport equipment maker wrote in the survey.
Some 261 firms responded on condition of anonymity in the Reuters Tankan conducted Aug. 1-14.
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 30 in August, up five points from the previous month, driven by auto and transport equipment companies. It was the highest reading since January when it hit an 11-year peak of 35.
The index is expected to rise further to 32 in November.
The service-sector index slid to 25 from 34 in the previous month, dragged down by information/communications, retailers/wholesalers, and other service firms.
It was the lowest level since December 2016. The index is expected to rise to 26 in November.
The BOJ's latest tankan showed big manufacturers' sentiment soured for a second straight quarter in the three months to June, hurt by rising input costs and as U.S. trade protectionism clouded the outlook for Japan's export-dependent economy.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.9 percent in the second quarter on the back of household and business spending, recovering from an earlier contraction.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rebounded less than expected from a nine-month low in July, suggesting the housing market was likely to tread water for the rest of this year against the backdrop of rising construction costs and labor shortages.
But the fundamentals for the housing market remain strong. New filings for jobless benefits fell again last week, other data showed on Thursday, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite an escalating trade war between the United States and China that has rattled financial markets.
""It is more expensive to buy a new home for the American worker,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""We cannot be confident that home construction will pick up in the near future.""
Housing starts rose 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.168 million units in July, the Commerce Department said. Starts fell to a nine-month low in June.
Groundbreaking activity increased in the Midwest and South, but dropped in the Northeast, and hit a more than 1-1/2-year low in the West. Last month's increase in starts still left the bulk of June's 12.9 percent plunge intact. 
Building permits increased 1.5 percent to a rate of 1.311 million units, snapping three straight months of decreases. With permits now outpacing starts, homebuilding could pick up in the months ahead.

Lumber prices shot up after the Trump administration slapped anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. Though prices have dropped in the past months, they remain high.
The housing market has underperformed a robust economy, with economists also blaming the slowdown on rising mortgage rates, which have combined with higher house prices to make home purchasing unaffordable for some first-time buyers. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen more than 50 basis points this year to an average of 4.53 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. While that is still low by historical standards, the rise has outpaced annual wage growth, which has been stuck below 3 percent.
At the same time, house prices have increased more than 6.0 percent on an annual basis, largely driven by a dearth of properties available for sale. Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year and economists do not expect housing to contribute to growth in the final six months of 2018.
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace logged in the January-March period.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.260 million units last month and permits increasing to a rate of 1.310 million units.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, rose 0.9 percent to a rate of 862,000 units in July. Single-family homebuilding has lost momentum since hitting a pace of 948,000 units last November, which was the strongest in more than 10 years.
Permits to build single-family homes jumped 1.9 percent in July to a pace of 869,000 units. Single-family building permits in the South, where more than half of homebuilding occurs, vaulted to an 11-year high in July.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment gained 0.7 percent to a rate of 306,000 units in July. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes climbed 0.7 percent to a pace of 442,000 units.
With the moderate rise in homebuilding last month, housing inventory is likely to remain tight. In addition, housing completions fell for a third straight month, hitting an eight-month low rate of 1.188 million. 
Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction was little changed at 1.122 million units. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended Aug. 11.

There have been reports of some companies either laying off workers or planning to as a result of the import duties. But with many companies reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, the fallout from the trade tensions might be minimal.

While there have been reports of some companies either laying off workers or planning to as a result of the import duties, that is not yet evident in the claims data. 
Economists say a robust economy is helping the labor market weather the trade storm. Companies are also reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, with the labor market viewed as being near or at full employment.
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2.2 percent pace logged in the first three months of the year.
Claims dropped to 208,000 during the week ended July 14, which was the lowest reading since December 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 215,000 in the latest week.
The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 last week to 215,500.

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 39,000 to 1.72 million for the week ended Aug. 4. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 8,000 to 1.74 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers spent more than expected in July, after hot weather and the World Cup continued to boost food sales and other retailers offered discounts, pointing to a solid start to the third quarter for the economy.
Retail sales volumes rose by 0.7 percent, and were 3.5 percent higher than a year earlier, above economists' average forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 0.2 percent monthly rise and a 3.0 percent annual gain.
This compares with sales growth a year earlier of just 1.1 percent though is below rates seen in 2015 and 2016.
Sterling, which has fallen sharply over the past couple of weeks due to fears that Britain could leave the European Union in March next year without any transitional deal, rallied a bit against the U.S. dollar after the data. 
""Retail sales posted a robust increase in July, suggesting that some recovery in consumer spending is in the pipeline,"" Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics said.
Looking at the three months to July as a whole, which smoothes out some monthly volatility, retail sales grew by 2.1 percent versus the previous three months, the biggest expansion since February 2015. 
Excluding fuel purchases -- which were dented by higher oil prices -- sales growth over the three months was the fastest since March 2004.
The sales growth comes despite tricky trading conditions for many high-street retailers, which saw department store chain House of Fraser seek creditor protection last week.
High inflation and lackluster pay increases have weakened household spending power for more than a year. Pay growth shows limited signs of strengthening as Britain prepares to leave the European Union in March next year.
Capital Economics' Wishart said he expected only a slight improvement in consumer spending during the third quarter of 2018 due to weakness in wages.
Britain's economy recorded solid but unspectacular growth in the second quarter of 2018 after unusually heavy snow weakened demand in the first three months of the year, and earlier this month the Bank of England raised interest rates for only the second time in more than a decade.
June and July were unusually warm, and previous surveys of consumer spending have shown that the soccer World Cup encouraged some Britons to spend in pubs and bars rather than in high street shops.
""Many consumers stayed away from some high street stores in July, but online sales were very strong, supported by several retailers launching promotions,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said. ""Food sales remained robust as people continued to enjoy the World Cup and the sunshine.""
Clothing sales recorded their strongest year-on-year growth since December, also helped by sales promotions, the ONS said.

Major clothing retailer  Next  (L:NXT) got a boost from Britain's hot summer with a 2.8 percent rise in second-quarter sales but the fashion retailer does not see the warm glow lasting, sticking to forecasts that indicate little growth for the rest of the year.

While fears of a disruptive trade war between the EU and the United States spooked markets in the second quarter of the year, such concerns subsided after U.S. President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker struck a deal last month.
Eurostat said the 19-country currency bloc had a goods trade surplus of 22.5 billion euros ($25.59 billion) in June, down from 25.7 billion a year earlier, but well above the 18 billion euros expected in a Reuters poll of seven economists.
While imports into the euro zone increased by 8.6 percent in June, exports were 5.7 percent higher.
For the European Union as a whole, exports to the United States increased by 3.9 percent in the first half of 2018, while imports fell by 2.4, widening the EU's trade surplus with its largest trading partner.
The data adds to a string of better economic news for the bloc after some downbeat signals earlier. On Tuesday, Eurostat revised up its estimate for economic growth in the euro zone in the second quarter.

Key Details
Big Picture
Australia’s jobs market has remained solid this year, while cooling from last year’s record run of full-time hiring. Annual economic growth accelerated to above 3 percent in the first quarter; the central bank is relying on that rapid expansion and record-low rates to drive hiring and wages and rekindle inflation. That would potentially clear the path for the first interest-rate hike since 2010, though traders see little prospect of a move in the next 12 months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in July as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and clothing, suggesting the economy remained strong early in the third quarter.
Other data on Wednesday showed manufacturing output rising steadily last month and worker productivity growing at its fastest pace in more than three years in the second quarter, though a drop in labor costs pointed to moderate wage inflation.
Strong domestic demand supports expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September for the third time this year, despite volatility in emerging markets that was sparked by an economic and political crisis in Turkey.
""The economy appears to be very well-positioned to continue to grow,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""The persistently optimistic consumer sector is doing its part to keep the growth engine going, and retailers are benefiting.""
The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.5 percent last month. But data for June was revised lower to show sales gaining 0.2 percent instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales nudging up 0.1 percent in July. Retail sales in July increased 6.4 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales advanced 0.5 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent dip in June. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Core retail sales were previously reported to have been unchanged in June. Consumer spending is being supported by a tightening labor market, which is gradually pushing up wages. Tax cuts and higher savings are also underpinning consumption.
July's increase in core retail sales suggested the economy started the third quarter on a solid footing after logging its best performance in nearly four years in the second quarter. 
GDP surged at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period, almost double the 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter. While the economy is unlikely to repeat the second quarter's robust performance, growth in the July-September period is expected to top a 3.0 percent rate.
The Fed increased borrowing costs in June and forecast two more interest rate hikes by December. 
The dollar was trading near a 13-month high against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries rose on Wednesday. Stocks on Wall Street fell sharply as the currency crisis in Turkey and ongoing concerns about trade policy hurt sentiment.
TRADE TENSIONS
The economy's prospects for the third quarter were also bolstered by a report from the U.S. central bank on Wednesday showing production at the nation's factories increased 0.3 percent in July after surging 0.8 percent in June.
Further gains are likely as a third report from the Commerce Department showed very lean inventories at businesses in June.
But the Trump administration's protectionist policies, which have led to an escalating trade war with China and tit-for-tat import tariffs with other trading partners, including the European Union, Canada and Mexico, have cast a shadow over the manufacturing sector and overall economy. 
Manufacturers are complaining of costlier raw materials as well as disruptions to the supply chain. Congressional researchers on Monday warned that the trade tensions could make a bigger dent on GDP growth than anticipated.
""The Fed continues to face an economy that has strong growth, rising prices but economic uncertainties, especially when the trade situation is factored in,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Unless Turkey unexpectedly creates major economic and financial problems, two more rate hikes remain the likely course of action.""   
Last month, auto sales rose 0.2 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in June. Sales at clothing stores rebounded 1.3 percent after declining 1.6 percent in June. Receipts at service stations advanced 0.8 percent.
Online and mail-order retail sales increased 0.8 percent, likely boosted by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's ""Prime Day"" promotion. That followed a 0.7 percent rise in June. Americans spent more at restaurants and bars, lifting sales 1.3 percent.
But receipts at furniture stores fell and sales at building material stores were unchanged last month. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores declined for a fourth straight month.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that business inventories edged up 0.1 percent after a downwardly revised 0.3 percent increase in May.
June's gain in inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product, was in line with economists' expectations. Inventories were previously reported to have increased 0.4 percent in May.
Retail inventories nudged up 0.1 percent in June instead of being flat as reported in an advance estimate published last month. Retail inventories increased 0.4 percent in May. Motor vehicle inventories slipped 0.1 percent in June rather than 0.3 percent as reported last month. 
Auto inventories rose 0.9 percent in May. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.2 percent in June rather than increasing 0.3 percent as reported last month. They gained 0.1 percent in May.
There was an outright inventory liquidation in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted a full percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate during that period, the fastest in nearly four years, following a 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter. 

Business sales rose 0.3 percent in June after rising 1.3 percent in May. At June's sales pace, it would take 1.33 months for businesses to clear shelves. That was the smallest inventories-to-sales ratio since October 2014 and was down from 1.34 months in May.

Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent in July, in line with analyst forecasts. Motor vehicle production rose 0.9 percent while output of machinery expanded 0.6 percent and computers and electronics grew 1.3 percent.
The data appeared to show U.S. factories weathering the early days of an escalation of a U.S. trade war with China. The Trump administration raised tariffs on a range of Chinese imports in July, triggering retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on U.S. exports. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is still being supported by a strong domestic and global economy. But many economists see a risk that escalating trade tensions could undercut business investment. 
Mining production fell 0.3 percent in July, with oil and gas well drilling down 4.3 percent. Utilities output dropped 0.5 percent in July.
With overall industrial production posting only a slight gain, capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, held steady last month at 78.1 percent. It is 1.7 percentage points below its 1972-to-2017 average.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity growing at a 2.3 percent rate in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2017, productivity increased at a rate of 1.3 percent. 
The government also revised data going back to 1947, which did not materially change the picture of lackluster productivity growth, though unit labor costs were stronger than previously estimated in 2017 because of upward revisions to hourly compensation. 
The annual rate of productivity growth from 2007 to 2017 was revised up 0.1 percentage point to a rate of 1.3 percent.
The pickup in productivity in the second quarter was flagged by a surge in economic growth during that period.
Gross domestic product increased at a 4.1 percent rate in the April-June quarter, the strongest performance in nearly four years. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter. The sluggish trend in productivity, however, suggests that the second-quarter GDP growth pace is unsustainable.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, fell at a 0.9 percent pace in the second quarter. That was the weakest pace since the third quarter of 2014. First-quarter growth in unit labor costs was revised up to a 3.4 percent rate from the previously reported 2.9 percent pace.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>","UK inflation rises for first time in 2018, London house prices fall","By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate picked up in July for the first time this year, leaving many British households feeling squeezed by prices that are rising at about the same pace as their salaries.
Official data also underscored the weakness in the property market since the 2016 Brexit vote, with prices in London falling at their fastest pace since 2009.
Overall, consumer price inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in July after holding at 2.4 percent in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said, in line with economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
It was the first time since November that inflation gained pace, slowing the recovery in spending power for many households, even if inflation is expected to fall back in the coming months.
""These figures show that the cost of living squeeze is not yet a thing of the past,"" said Tej Parikh, an economist at the Institute of Directors, an employers group, noting high oil prices and a rise in utility bills.
On Tuesday, data showed average earnings, including bonuses, rose an annual 2.4 percent in the three months to June, extending a long run of pay rises below their pre-financial crisis levels. 
""This is likely to weigh down consumer spending, posing fresh problems for embattled high street businesses,"" Parikh said.
On Tuesday, Homebase, which sells DIY goods, became the latest casualty among retailers struggling to cope with a tougher market -- as well as the rise of online shopping -- saying it would close 42 stores.
When the Bank of England raised interest rates this month, it said inflation would rise to 2.6 percent in July before weakening. It expects inflation will be just above its 2 percent target in two years' time as it slowly raises borrowing costs. 
But many private economists think inflation will prove to be weaker than the BoE is predicting.
Sterling, which has fallen in recent weeks on concerns about the lack of an agreement on Britain's leaving the European Union and the signals about how gradually rates will rise, briefly fell after Wednesday's data.
The CPI hit a five-year high of 3.1 percent in November, when the inflationary effect of the pound's tumble after the Brexit vote reached its peak.
OIL PRESSURE
Prices for computers games -- which are often volatile -- and transport fares pushed up inflation in July. Prices for clothing fell. The removal of initial charges for investment in some unit trusts also held inflation down. 
Another measure of inflation, the retail price index, rose by 3.2 percent, its weakest rise since March 2017, offering a little bit of relief to rail travelers -- many annual ticket price increases from January will be set by that reading.
There is some pressure in the pipeline for consumers. The cost of raw materials for manufacturers was 10.9 percent higher, the biggest annual rise in over a year, reflecting an increase of more than 50 percent in oil prices.
Manufacturers raised the prices they charged by 3.1 percent, weaker than June's 3.3 percent but slightly above the forecast in the Reuters poll.
House prices in June rose by an annual 3.0 percent across the United Kingdom as a whole, the weakest increase since August 2013. 
Prices in London alone fell by 0.7 percent, the biggest fall since September 2009, during the global financial crisis.

Other measures of house prices have also slowed to about half the rate before the Brexit vote, a slowdown caused by a combination of record high valuations, the squeeze on spending power and uncertainty about Britain's relationship with the European Union.

1239,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>",UK CPI Rises by 2.5% in July,"Investing.com - British consumer prices in July rose by 2.5% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.
That was in line with expectations and up from 2.4% in June.
It was the first increase in inflation in eight months, boosted by the cost of auto fuel, transport tickets and computer games.
Upward pressures on inflation were offset by some financial services and clothing and footwear prices, which declined 3.7% on the month as struggling retailers extended summer discounts.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.9% last month, the same as its increase a month earlier.
The inflation figures came a day after data showing that Britain's unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to a new 43-year low in the three months to June, but there was little upside for most workers as pay growth slowed to its weakest in nine months.
The figures painted a familiar picture of tightness in Britain's labor market -- including record high job vacancies -- failing to translate into strong wage growth.
The Bank of England raised interest rates earlier this month, but signaled it was in no hurry to lift them further as Britain heads for Brexit next year with no clear plan for leaving the European Union.
With less than eight months until Britain leaves the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has begun talking more publicly about the prospect of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement on what happens next.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 11:46PM ET</span>",China's new home price growth hits two-year high as small cities boom,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices accelerated at their fastest pace in almost two years in July, led by smaller cities and highlighting challenges policymakers face in stimulating a slowing economy without fueling a property bubble.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 1.1 percent in July from a month earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on an official survey on Wednesday, the fastest pace since October 2016 and up from the previous month's reading of 1 percent.
Outside the recent boom periods of 2016 and early 2013, monthly price gains of more than 1 percent have been rare in China's official home price data.
The July increase also marks the 39th straight month of gains, Reuters calculations showed, despite tougher curbs designed to rein in a more-than-two-year real estate boom.
The 35 tier-3 cities in the survey led the price rally in the month while price growth in China's four largest cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and the 31 tier-2 cities -- which comprise sizeable provincial capitals -- was more subdued. 
The market's surprising resilience also partly reflects the prevalence of buyers skirting existing restrictions on purchases. China said in late June that it would renew a crackdown on property irregularities in 30 major cities this year, prompting several local governments to ban corporate entities from buying residential properties. 
""It is not a good time to relax existing curbs now and policymakers should continue to step up property controls,"" Zhang Yiping, an analyst with China Merchants Securities said after Wednesday's data release. 
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) still reported monthly price increases for new homes. 65 cities reported higher prices in July, up from 63 in June.
Yang Yewei, an analyst at Southwest Securities, said declining housing inventory combined with still robust demand has exacerbated a housing supply shortage.
Compared with a year earlier, new home prices rose 5.8 percent, the fastest pace since September 2017 and quickening from June's 5 percent gain. 
Analysts say a spill-over effect from Beijing's efforts to step up credit support to smaller firms in the economy may have buoyed demand and quickened sales in the real estate sector.
Despite Beijing's determination to maintain property curbs, funding appears to be easing for property developers as Beijing pumps more credit into the economy to cushion the impact of a tit-for-tat trade war with the United States.
China's property investment growth sped up to its quickest pace in nearly two years in July, data showed on Tuesday, with year-on-year sales growth more than doubling from the previous month.
The resort city of Sanya, a tier-3 city in the island province of Hainan, was the top price performer in the month, rising 3.7 percent on-month, NBS data showed.
Tier-3 cities collectively posted a robust month-on-month price increase of 1.5 percent for new homes, the NBS said in a statement accompanying the data on Wednesday. That was more than double their 0.7 percent price gain in June.
Figures from the latest central bank monetary policy implementation report last Friday showed that the weighted average lending rate for individual home buyers rose 18 basis points in the second quarter, versus a 16 basis point rise in the previous quarter.  

However, Southwest Securities' Yang said while China's mortgage lending rates have gradually risen, credit remains easily accessible in smaller cities.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>",U.S. import prices flat; dollar limits imported inflation,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices were unchanged in July as a surge in the cost of fuels was offset by weak prices elsewhere, suggesting that a strong dollar was keeping imported inflation in check.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday the flat reading in import prices last month followed an upwardly revised 0.1 percent drop in June. Import prices were previously reported to have declined 0.4 percent in June.
""The U.S. is no longer importing disinflation,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, growth in import prices will be limited by the recent appreciation in the U.S. dollar, which affects nonfuel import prices with a lag.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices gaining 0.1 percent in July. In the 12 months through July, import prices rose 4.8 percent, the largest gain since February 2012, after increasing 4.7 percent in June.
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants jumped 1.6 percent after rising 1.3 percent in June. Food prices dropped 1.8 percent after declining 2.6 percent in June. Excluding fuels and food, import prices slipped 0.1 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in the prior month. 
The so-called core import prices increased 1.6 percent in the 12 months through July.
The dollar gained 0.5 percent versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in July and has strengthened more than 4 percent on a trade-weighted basis so far this year. This could temper the anticipated increases in the prices of some imported goods as a result of trade tensions between the United States and other major economies.
The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect domestic industries from what it says is unfair foreign competition. Major trading partners, including the European Union, China, Mexico and Canada have responded similarly with tariffs of their own.
EXPORT PRICES FALL
Washington has also slapped import duties on Canadian lumber as well as a range of consumer goods from China. While import prices exclude duties, economists say the tariffs will soon show up in producer and consumer prices.
""It's early yet in the trade wars battle, and more inflation from higher-priced imported goods may still be on the way,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
In July, import prices for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials tumbled 1.0 percent, the biggest monthly drop since January 2016, after rising 0.2 percent in June. 
The cost of imported capital goods dipped 0.1 percent for a second straight month in July. Imported motor vehicle prices were unchanged. The cost of consumer goods excluding automobiles rose 0.3 percent, reversing June's 0.3 percent drop.
Prices of goods imported from China fell 0.2 percent in July, the first drop in 10 months, after edging up 0.1 percent in June. The cost of Chinese imports rose 0.2 percent in the 12 months through July after increasing 0.5 percent in June.
Though tariffs are excluded from import prices, they are having an impact on the value of U.S. exports. Export prices dropped 0.5 percent in July, the biggest decline in 14 months, after rising 0.2 percent in June. 
Export prices for agricultural products tumbled 5.3 percent last month, the largest decline since October 2011, weighed down by a 14.1 percent plunge in soybean prices. 
China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans have driven down prices in recent months. There were also declines in the prices for corn, wheat, fruits and nuts in July. 
Export prices increased 4.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in July after rising 5.3 percent in June. Agricultural prices fell 2.0 percent in the 12 months to July, the first annual decrease in a year, after increasing 5.3 percent in June.
""The impact of tariffs on agricultural commodity prices from the trade disputes is showing through,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Prices for nonagricultural exports were unchanged in July 2017 after rising 0.4 percent in June.

The level of U.S. consumer debt was $618 billion higher than the previous peak of $12.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2008. It was 19.2 percent above a post global credit crisis low set in the second quarter of 2013, the New York Fed said.
The ongoing growth in home, auto, student and credit loans has been linked with a solid labor market.
The rise in indebtedness did not make it more difficult for borrowers to meet their monthly payments last quarter.
The rate on seriously delinquent loans, or those that are 90 days or more past due, was 2.3 percent in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter. Notably, the pace of student loans turning seriously delinquent slowed to 8.6 percent from 8.9 percent, the N.Y. Fed survey showed.
""While overall delinquency rates have remained stable at relatively low levels, transition rates into delinquency have fallen noticeably for student loan over the past year, reflecting an improved labor market and increased participation in various income-driven repayment plans,"" Wilbert van der Klaauw, senior vice president at the New York Fed, said in a statement.
The amount of student loans grew to $1.41 trillion in the second quarter, up $61 billion from a year before.
Total auto debt increased to $1.24 trillion, $48 billion above a year-ago.
Credit card loans climbed $45 billion from a year earlier to $829 billion.

Total mortgage debt rose to $9.00 trillion, up $308 billion from a year ago.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone growth was better than expected in the second quarter, flash estimates showed on Tuesday, in a sign that the negative effects of global trade tensions might be seen only later in the year.
However, while the economy expanded by 0.4 percent in the second quarter, above forecasts of 0.3 percent growth, industrial output in the in 19-country currency bloc fell sharply in June driven by a collapse in machinery and equipment investment, European statistics office Eurostat said.
Eurostat's flash growth estimate was also higher than its previous estimate of 0.3 percent growth. The agency also revised up the year-on-year growth to 2.2 percent from its previous 2.1 percent estimate.
The revised monthly figure, if confirmed by final data to be released on Sept. 7, would show that the bloc has maintained a 0.4 percent growth pace in the first two quarters of the year, confounding initial fears of a slowdown in the second quarter.
The better-than-expected estimate could increase the European Central Bank's confidence in winding down its asset purchase program, but the growth outlook remains unclear, given the industrial output data.
The bloc was outperformed by the United States which doubled to 1.0 percent its quarterly growth from 0.5 percent in the first quarter of the year.
Eurostat's upward revision came after Germany, the bloc's largest economy, recorded a better-than-expected 0.5 percent expansion in the second quarter, driven by consumption and state spending that could signal the beginning of a shift from Germany's export-led economic model.
But it said the bloc's industrial output fell by 0.7 percent in June on the month, recording a larger drop than expected by economists polled by Reuters who had forecast a 0.4 percent fall.
Germany's monthly output was down by 0.6 percent in June after a 2.4 percent growth in May, Eurostat said.
""For the months ahead, production seems to be limited by concerns about the global economy on the one hand and capacity constraints on the other,"" Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank said in a note to clients, predicting that the euro zone's current growth rate would remain unchanged this year.
""2018 has been somewhat of a disappointment so far."" 
The euro zone's highly volatile industrial production had expanded by 1.4 percent in May, Eurostat said, revising up its previous estimate of 1.3 percent growth.
The production plunge was mostly driven by a 2.9 percent drop in the output of capital goods, like machinery, in a sign that firms may be preparing for slower growth in the coming months.
The output of consumer and intermediate goods also fell, while the production of energy increased by 0.5 percent from May. 
On the year, industry output was up by 2.5 percent in June, and the May figure was revised up to 2.6 percent from a previous estimate of a 2.4 percent increase.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 06:16AM ET</span>",'Alive and kicking': German economy shifts into higher gear,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy picked up more pace than expected in the second quarter, driven by higher household and state spending, suggesting that it is powering ahead despite the threat of a major trade dispute with the United States.
Gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in April-June, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday, beating economists' consensus forecast of 0.4 percent in a Reuters poll.
The office also revised up the quarterly growth rate for the first three months of the year to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent.
Fears of a full-blown trade war between the European Union and United States deepened during the second quarter. However, these eased last month after U.S. President Donald Trump met European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
In a further positive sign, German investor morale improved more than expected in August following the Washington meeting, the ZEW institute said.
""Despite all of the prophecies of doom, the upswing is not only alive, it's also kicking,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said. ""For the time being, the upswing is unlikely to be stalled by the global trade dispute or overheating.""
The German economy ministry and ZEW researcher Achim Wambach both cautioned, however, that Germany's growth outlook remained clouded by Trump's tariff threats.
The government forecast 2.3 percent economic growth this year and 2.1 percent for next. This would be well above Germany's average pace of the past 10 years.
STRONG IMPORTS
On the year, the German economy grew by 2.0 percent from April to June, calendar-adjusted data showed. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 2.1 percent expansion.
The Statistics Office said economic growth was mainly driven by higher household spending and increased state consumption. Additional impetus came from investments.
Exports also grew but were outperformed by even stronger imports, suggesting that net trade did not contribute to overall economic growth, the office said.
The figures underpin a gradual shift in the German economy away from its traditional export-oriented growth towards a more domestically driven upturn, propelled by record-high employment, rising wages and booming construction.
""Contrary to the national football team, the German economy did not have a rude awakening at the start of the summer,"" ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said, referring to the side's early exit from the World Cup. ""Instead, the economy has returned as an outperformer of the euro zone."" 
Following the stronger-than-expected German growth figures, euro zone GDP growth was revised up to 0.4 percent in the second quarter, supporting perceptions of steady growth despite increased trade tensions in the April-June period. [nL5N1V5325]
A separate release from the German statistics office showed consumer inflation, harmonised to make it comparable with other euro zone data, remained at 2.1 percent on the year in July.
It was the third month in a row that German headline inflation exceeded the European Central Bank's price stability target of close to but below 2 percent for the whole bloc.
""The upward revision to euro zone GDP growth in Q2 will make policymakers at the ECB more confident that they are right to be winding down their asset purchases,"" Jack Allen from Capital Economics said.

The ECB plans to wrap up its unprecedented 2.6 trillion euro stimulus programme by the end of the year, but to keep interest rates at record lows through the summer of 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to a new 43-year low in the three months to June and productivity rose, but there was little upside for most workers as pay growth slowed to its weakest in nine months.
Tuesday's official figures also showed the sharpest annual fall in the number of EU workers in Britain since 1997, continuing a trend seen since the 2016 Brexit vote. 
The figures painted a familiar picture of tightness in Britain's labor market -- including record high job vacancies -- failing to translate into strong wage growth.
""This will not be what the Bank of England will have wanted to see, as one of the justifications for (its) decision to hike rates earlier this month was that it was expecting wage growth to start lifting off. This hasn't happened yet,"" said Emma-Lou Montgomery, an associate director at Fidelity International.
The BoE raised interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis earlier this month.
Tuesday's data also showed productivity grew at its fastest annual rate since late 2016 and the number of people whose main job was an insecure zero-hours contract fell by the most since 2000, the Office for National Statistics said.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.0 percent in the April-June period, the lowest since the three months to February 1975 and beating economists' forecasts for it to hold steady at a previous low of 4.2 percent.
The drop came despite a smaller-than-expected number of jobs created over the three-month period, of 42,000 -- less than half the average forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
""Overall the data could be described as mildly positive for the pound, and the currency quickly spiked up to its highest level of the day not long after the release,"" said David Cheetham, chief market analyst at currency broker XTB.
""This seemed to be a bit of a knee jerk reaction to the unemployment figures and the gains have been pared as traders digested the miss in wages,"" he added.
Total annual wage growth slowed to a nine-month low of 2.4 percent, below forecasts for it to hold at 2.5 percent. The ONS said changes to the timing of annual bonus payments was partly responsible. 
Excluding bonuses, pay growth held steady at 2.7 percent, well below the 4 percent rate typical before the financial crisis a decade ago.
Output per hour worked grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the April-June period, the biggest increase since late 2016 after a 0.9 percent rise in the first quarter of 2018.
Britain's economy warmed up a little in the second quarter from its winter slowdown of early 2018, official data showed last week, but there was no sign of an end to its stuttering performance ahead of Brexit next year.
With less than eight months until Britain is due to leave the European Union, the ONS data showed an acceleration of EU nationals leaving Britain's workforce.
In the second quarter there were 2.35 million EU nationals working in Britain, down 86,000 on a year ago -- a 3.6 percent drop that was the largest since records began.
The number of nationals from the eight East European countries that joined the EU in 2004 fell by 117,000, an 11.7 percent drop on the year.

The number of workers employed on often-precarious zero-hours contracts fell by a similar amount over the year -- the biggest drop since 2000 -- to 780,000 or 2.4 percent of the workforce, the smallest since 2015.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy is showing signs of cooling further as the U.S. prepares even tougher trade tariffs, with investment growth slowing to a record low and consumers turning more cautious about spending, data showed on Tuesday. 
Fixed-asset investment expanded by a less-than-expected 5.5 percent in January-July, a result of Beijing's crackdown on lavish local government borrowing for projects to boost growth.
Industrial output also undershot expectations, weighed down by pollution curbs and the uncertain trade outlook, adding to expectations that authorities will roll out more policy stimulus measures.
With the trade war threatening more pressure on China's already slowing economy, Beijing has shifted its focus to boosting domestic demand and is taking a more measured approach in its campaign to reduce financial risks and debt, which has pushed up borrowing costs and triggered a rising number of defaults.
The government has pledged to ramp up spending on railways and roads -- its traditional ""go-to"" approach when the economy slows -- while the central bank is pumping more money into the system and urging banks to offer more loans at cheaper rates to small businesses.
New yuan loans exceeded expectations in July, statistics showed on Monday, in one of the few bright spots in the most recent data.
""Admittedly, infrastructure spending may soon bottom out given the recent shift toward a looser fiscal stance and monetary easing should eventually drive a turnaround in credit growth,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. 
""However, these are unlikely to put a floor beneath economic growth until the middle of next year.""
With the economy shifting into lower gear even without a trade shock, Capital Economics has predicted China's central bank will soon cut its official lending rate for the first time since 2015, though most analysts predict a more modest but steady stream of support measures in coming months.
The Shanghai ""Nifty 50"" stock index (SSE50) fell about 0.8 percent after the disappointing data, which added to a sour mood in global financial markets.
WEAKENING DOMESTIC DEMAND
The pace of fixed asset investment was the weakest on record going back to early 1996, according to data on Reuters Eikon. Investment had been expected to grow 6.0 percent in the first seven months of the year, steady from January-June. 
For July, fixed-asset investment grew 3.0 percent from a year earlier.
Retail sales also missed expectations, with Chinese consumers more reluctant to spend on everything from cosmetics and other everyday goods to big-ticket items such as home appliances and furniture. 
Sales rose 8.8 percent in July from a year earlier, below an expected 9.1 percent and down from 9.0 percent in June, despite a broad import tax cut that kicked in last month.
It was not clear if consumer reluctance was due to softening local conditions or worries about the U.S. trade war. A Reuters straw poll of Chinese consumers found nearly one in three want to stop buying U.S. products now and some are already boycotting made-in-America goods.
Industrial output also failed to pick up as expected. It rose 6.0 percent in July, missing analysts' estimates for 6.3 percent and unchanged from June.
While China's trade and inflation have shown limited impact from U.S. tariffs so far, it is early days. Business surveys point to weakening export orders and there are concerns that a protracted trade battle could produce a sharper Chinese slowdown than expected just a few months ago.
China and the United States have slapped tariffs on each other's goods and more are due to kick in next week, with few signs that either side is in the mood to compromise.
SOME BRIGHTER SPOTS
In one of the few encouraging spots in the data, private sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.8 percent in January-July, picking up from 8.4 percent in the first half. It accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.
But growth in infrastructure spending, a powerful economic driver, slowed to 5.7 percent in the first seven months from 7.3 percent.
Still, there were early signs that Beijing's shift to supporting growth may already be offering some cushion.
Real estate investment jumped 13.2 percent in July on-year, the fastest in nearly two years and higher than June's 8.4 percent rise, according to Reuters calculations.
New construction starts jumped 32.4 percent on-year, likely buoyed by stronger home sales, improved funding conditions for cash-strapped developers and the government's heavy spending on public housing.
Infrastructure loans also rebounded sharply in July to 172.4 billion yuan ($25.05 billion) the banking and insurance regulator said on Saturday. 
The Politburo said last month it would achieve this year's target of around 6.5 percent, despite risks to growth. Last year it expanded 6.9 percent.
The shift to stimulus measures has raised fears among some China watchers that Beijing is returning to its old playbook of debt-fueled growth, undermining its multi-year push to reduce riskier lending practices and a mountain of debt.
But unless conditions deteriorate markedly, most economists believe Beijing will stick with its deleveraging campaign, albeit at a more cautious pace, as it waits to see how the trade dispute plays out.
For now, a return to massive money printing like that seen during the global financial crisis, which would risk a further debt blowout, does not seem to be on the cards.

Industrial output grew 6% in July from a year earlier, according to official data, while analysts had expected the output to grow at 6.3%.
Fixed-asset investment growth on the other hand also slowed more than expected to 5.5% in the first seven months of the year.
Private sector investment, which accounted for about 60% of overall investment in China, rose 8.8% in the period of January to July, compared with an increase of 8.4% in the first half year.
Retail sales rose 8.8% in July from a year earlier, compared to the expected 9.1% and down from 9% in June.
Analysts believe an escalating trade dispute with the U.S. and recent tightening policies are likely to impact the outlook of China’s economy and that it may be at risk of a sharper slowdown than expected.
“The economy is slowing down as the result of the relatively tight policies in the past six quarters,” said Gene Ma, chief China economist at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, who expects fiscal policy to be more supportive in the second half of 2018. “Tighter policies on shadow credit inevitably hurt small and private businesses. Rising trade tension started to hurt confidence, but not yet the real growth as exporters moved up their exports.”
""There was too much tightening"" and there were policy errors made in the first half that ought to be corrected, Liang Hong, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation Ltd. in Beijing, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""Some of the policy adjustments just happened in July, so people are expecting in the third quarter we should see more stabilization."""

The National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions dipped 2 points to +12 in July, but remained well above the long-run average of +6.
The often volatile measure of business confidence actually added a point to +7, a surprise given some other recent surveys had shown a sharp pullback in July.
The NAB survey's measure of profitability fell 5 points to +10 in July, unwinding all of June's jump, while its sales index eased 4 points to a still historically high +17.
In a promising development, the survey's employment index bounced 5 points to +10.
""The employment index - based on historical patterns - is consistent with jobs growth around 23,000 per month, which should see the unemployment rate continue to edge lower over the rest of 2018,"" said NAB group chief economist Alan Oster.
Official data for employment in July are due on Thursday and are forecast to show an increase of around 15,000, following a very strong gain of almost 51,000 in June.
NAB's employment index was highest in the mining industry, followed by finance, business & property services as well as construction.
Overall business conditions improved markedly in the construction sector in July, followed by personal & recreation services and wholesale. Conditions fell in manufacturing, retail, finance, business & property and transport & utilities.
Surveyed wage and price measures rose in July, but still pointed to subdued inflation.
""The business sector looks relatively healthy, and we expect to see enough employment growth to see a gradual reduction in spare capacity, which should in time see a rise in wage growth, and a more general lift in inflation,"" said Oster.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has highlighted the strength in business conditions as it forecast economic growth would top 3 percent this year and next.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese banks extended 1.45 trillion yuan ($210.69 billion) in net new yuan loans in July, above analysts' expectations, as a growing trade battle with the United States threatens to pile more pressure on the slowing economy.
China's policymakers have been pumping in more cash to encourage banks to lend to struggling firms, but there are signs that lenders are turning cautious as defaults rise, complicating efforts to channel money to sectors that need it.
Moreover, some China watchers fear Beijing's shift in focus to supporting growth may spell a return to its credit-fuelled spending binges of the past, undercutting a multi-year campaign to reduce risks in the financial system and a mountain of debt.
The stronger-than-expected lending data was released by China's banking and insurance regulator, as the central bank pumps out more liquidity into a slowing economy.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans of 1.2 trillion yuan, down sharply from June's 1.84 trillion yuan. 
China's banks extended a record 13.53 trillion yuan in new loans last year, and lent 9.03 trillion yuan in the first half of this year, a jump of 13 percent from the same period of 2017.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 634.4 billion yuan in July from 707.3 billion yuan in June, according to the central bank's data.
Household loans accounted for 43.8 percent of total new loans in July, versus 38.4 percent in June.
Corporate loans fell to 650.1 billion yuan in July from 981.9 billion yuan a month earlier.
Chinese banks usually make few loans in July after traditionally ramping up lending in June.
Broad M2 money supply grew 8.5 percent in July from a year earlier - the highest in five months, data from the People's Bank of China showed on Monday, beating forecasts for an expansion of 8.2 percent and compared with a record low of 8.0 percent in June.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 13.2 percent from a year earlier, faster than an expected 12.8 percent rise and compared with an increase of 12.7 percent in June. 
China's total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, dropped to 1.04 trillion yuan in July from 1.18 trillion yuan in June, data from the central bank showed on Monday.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
That can provide hints of activity in China's vast and unregulated shadow banking sector, which authorities have also been targeting in their campaign to reduce systemic risks.

Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted bankers' acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking finance, shrank by 1.26 trillion yuan in the first six months.

That compared to a budget deficit of $43 billion in the same month last year, the department's monthly budget statement showed. 
The 79 percent rise was in line with analysts' expectations. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury posting a $77 billion deficit in July.
The government's deficit was $124 billion when accounting for calendar adjustments. That compared to an adjusted deficit of $85 billion in the same month the prior year.
The deficit for the fiscal year, which began last October, reached $684 billion, compared to a deficit of $566 billion in the same period of fiscal 2017. On an adjusted basis, the gap of $734 billion compared with $606 billion in the previous period.

Unadjusted receipts last month totaled $225 billion, down 3 percent from July last year, while unadjusted outlays were $302 billion, a jump of 10 percent from the same month in 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose in July and the underlying trend continued to strengthen, pointing to a steady increase in inflation pressures that keeps the Federal Reserve on track to gradually raise interest rates.
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index advanced 0.2 percent, the bulk of which was due to a rise in the cost of shelter, driven by higher rents. The CPI rose 0.1 percent in June.
In the 12 months through July, the CPI increased 2.9 percent, matching the increase in June.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2 percent, the same gain as in May and June. The annual increase in the so-called core CPI was 2.4 percent, the largest rise since September 2008, from 2.3 percent in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast both the CPI and core CPI rising 0.2 percent in July.
U.S. Treasury yields held near three-week lows and U.S. stocks fell on anxiety about Turkey's financial woes and its deepening rift with the United States. The U.S. dollar (DXY) was trading higher against a basket of currencies.
""As the July CPI figures make clear, underlying price pressures are still mounting,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
The Fed more closely tracks a different inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, which increased 1.9 percent in June.
That gauge hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in March for the first time in more than six years and Fed policymakers have said they will not be unduly concerned if it overshoots its target in the coming months.
The U.S. central bank has raised rates twice this year, in March and June, and financial markets overwhelmingly expect a hike at the next policy meeting in September.
The Fed currently forecasts a total of four rate rises in 2018, with investors expecting a final nudge upwards of the year in the benchmark overnight lending rate in December.
Inflation pressures are seen continuing to build amid low unemployment and increasing difficulty reported by employers in filling positions. Rising raw material costs are also expected to push up inflation as manufacturers pay more, in part because of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on lumber, aluminum and steel imports.
Last month, gasoline prices fell 0.6 percent after increasing 0.5 percent in June. Food prices edged up 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in June.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, advanced 0.3 percent last month after increasing by the same margin in June. Overall, the so-called shelter index rose 3.5 percent in the 12 months through July.

Healthcare costs fell 0.2 percent after gaining 0.4 percent in June. Prices for new motor vehicles rose 0.3 percent in July following a 0.4 percent increase in the prior month. Apparel prices were down 0.3 percent after a 0.9 percent drop in June.

1257,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",U.S. Inflation Missed Expectations in July ,"Investing.com - U.S. inflation unexpectedly held steady in July, relieving the pressure on the Federal Reserve to speed up its normalization of monetary policy.
Consumer price inflation rose by an annualized 2.9% in July, the Labor Department said, missing expectations for an acceleration to 3.0%.
Inflation remains a central concern for markets as increasing price pressures would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently forecast.
The Fed left rates on hold at the current range of 1.75%-2.00% last month and offered few additional signals for monetary policy, other than noting the solid economic strength, which kept a move in September firmly on the table.
Overall, the Fed tracks a different inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, which eased back down to 1.9% in June.
The core PCE index had hit its 2% objective in May.
Friday’s release also showed that, month-on-month, CPI rose 0.2% in July, in line with the consensus forecast.
Core CPI, a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.2% from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.
In the 12 months through July, core CPI rose 2.4%, compared to 2.3% a month earlier. Economists were looking for it to hold steady at June’s 2.3% advance.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's exports to the United States in the first half of this year were worth 24.4 billion euros ($28.3 billion) more than its imports of U.S. goods, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday.
The trade surplus was 100 million euros less than last year, but still meant Germany has the largest trade surplus with the United States than any other country, something U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to reverse.
Germany's trade surplus has also come under attack from the International Monetary Fund, which says it contributes to trade tensions and adds to risks that could undermine global financial stability.
Germany's trade surplus with the whole world was 121.5 billion euros in the first half, slightly higher that last year.
The IMF has urged the German government to boost investments beyond the levels agreed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government which plans to increase spending by 4 percent this year. Higher government spending would stimulate imports.
Trump hit the European Union, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum at the start of June, ending exemptions that had been in place since March. The EU and Canada responded with their own levies on U.S. goods.
China imposed tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump's levies on Chinese imports, spooking German manufacturers who rely on the world's two largest economies for growth.
Fears of an all-out trade war between the U.S. and the European Union eased after Trump agreed last month to refrain from imposing tariffs on cars imported from the bloc while the two sides negotiate cuts to other trade barriers.
Germany's exports to the United States - its biggest export market - rose 0.8 percent to 56.1 billion euros in the first six months of the year. France was the second-largest importer of German goods, followed by the Netherlands.

Gross domestic product expanded 0.4 percent in the April-June period, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists, the Office for National Statistics said.
Britain's economy slowed after the 2016 Brexit vote and is expected to continue to expand at weaker pace than most other developed economies with the country due to leave the European Union in March next year.
The quarterly figure is likely to reassure Bank of England policymakers who last week raised interest rates to a new post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent.
""The economy picked up a little in the second quarter with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather from the effects of the snow earlier in the year,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
""However, manufacturing continued to fall back from its high point at the end of last year and underlying growth remained modest by historical standards.""
In June alone, the economy grew 0.1 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in May, weaker than forecasts in the Reuters poll for a 0.2 percent expansion, the ONS said.
Growth over the second quarter was driven mostly by the service sector, the ONS said. Net trade was the biggest drag on the economy since the third quarter of 2016.
Quarterly growth in household spending quickened slightly to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent in the first quarter, but stood only 1.1 percent higher than a year ago -- the weakest annual increase since early 2012.
Compared with a year ago, the economy stood 1.3 percent larger in the second quarter, only a touch above a nearly six-year low touched in the first three months of the year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Foreign exchange analysts had been expecting the New Zealand dollar to strengthen during the course of a year, according to a Reuters poll, but were caught off guard as the country's dovish central bank sent the currency careening off its stubborn trading range this week.
The survey of 34-38 analysts, conducted in the week ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand policy meeting on Thursday, predicted the kiwi  at $0.6800 between one and three months, $0.6900 in six months and $0.7100 in a year.
The kiwi, which had been trading in a $0.6750-$0.6950 range since mid-June, plunged to a near 2-1/2-year low after the RBNZ left the door ajar for a rate cut. 
The kiwi was last at $0.6587, a level not seen since February 2016. 
Only one bank - ING - predicted the kiwi at $0.6500 between one and three months, but it expects the currency to rise to $0.7500 in a year's time. Monex Europe and ANZ were among those forecasting losses for the kiwi over a 12-month horizon. 
""We think conditions are ripe for the NZD to ... remain under selling pressure through the rest of this year,"" said Phil Borkin, senior macro strategist, ANZ.
""And, as the market grapples with the idea that the RBNZ is going to be extremely late to the monetary policy tightening party, and may not show up at all, then that could see the NZD undershoot where some of our current fair value models suggests it should reside.""
Analysts also predicted small future moves for the Aussie, which currently sits near an eight-month trough of $0.7318. 
The median forecast of 40-50 analysts puts the Aussie at $0.7400 in one month, $0.7425 in three months, $0.7600 in six months and $0.7700 over a one-year horizon.
The predictions are barely changed from last month when fears of a global trade war had rattled investors and even as the U.S. dollar pulled up on generally strong economic indicators.
The Aussie has so far fallen 6.5 percent this year, whereas the kiwi has suffered a more than 7 percent drop.
Easy monetary policies in Australia and New Zealand at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is on a tightening path further adds to the bearish case for the antipodeans.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left rates at a record low of 1.50 percent since August 2016, and given a clear signal that the policy will remain accommodative for a while.
Still, analysts generally expect the Aussie to do better than the kiwi, going forward. The RBA Governor Philip Lowe reiterated this week that the next move in interest rates was up, not down while the RBNZ has signaled rates could go lower.
""This week's events have increased the chances that interest rates in Australia will rise a bit earlier than we expected and that rates in New Zealand will rise a bit later,"" said Paul Dales, chief economist, Capital Economics. 
""That gives us more confidence that the kiwi dollar will weaken more than the Aussie dollar.""

Exports are expected to have risen 6.3 percent in July from a year earlier, the poll of 16 economists showed, after rising 6.7 percent in June.
Imports likely climbed 14.4 percent last month, accelerating from a revised 2.6 percent increase in June, as higher oil prices and a weaker yen boosted import costs.
As a result, trade balance will likely show a 50 billion yen ($451.02 million) deficit for July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Japanese trade officials said they better understood each other's positions after talks on Thursday, while Tokyo appeared to stick to its position of avoiding a bilateral free-trade agreement.
""We had a frank exchange of views and deepened mutual understanding,"" Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters after several hours of meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, which he said would continue on Friday.
However, Motegi reiterated Japan's view that multilateral talks, which Washington has abandoned, were the best way to address trade issues. Tokyo wants to avoid a bilateral free-trade agreement - which Lighthizer called for in the past - where it could come under pressure over access to its auto and agricultural markets.
""Ambassador Lighthizer and Minister Motegi had a thorough and constructive exchange of views on all bilateral trade issues,"" Lighthizer's office said. ""They understand each other’s conditions for further discussions and plan to move forward with additional talks."" 
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, calling it a bad deal and saying he preferred bilateral talks.
Thursday's talks launched a round of what the two sides call ""free, fair and reciprocal"" negotiations. They fall within broader bilateral economic discussions led by Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso. 
Motegi said Japan and the United States agreed they want to achieve results quickly. He declined to give details of the first day's discussions, telling reporters he would ""say what I can after the first round of talks end"".

Trump's threats to impose higher tariffs on auto imports, including those from Japan, raised concerns such a step would harm both economies.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew more than expected in the second quarter, helped by strong household and business spending and recovering from an earlier contraction, but global trade tensions loom as major risks to the export and investment outlook.
The rebound in consumer spending is a welcome development for the Bank of Japan but unlikely to be enough to change its stance that interest rates need to stay low for a very long time to end the country's deflationary mindset.
While analysts expect the economy to sustain a recovery, some expect escalating global trade disputes will hurt the export and manufacturing sector, major drivers of growth in the world's third largest economy.
""Things are going well, but given questions around trade friction between the United States and China, there is a lot of uncertainty whether things will continue to go well,"" Finance Minister Taro Aso said.
Japan's economy expanded 1.9 percent on an annualized basis in April-June, beating a median market forecast for a 1.4 percent increase, government data showed on Friday.
That followed a revised 0.9 percent contraction, larger than initial estimates, in the previous quarter, which put an end to the best run of growth since the 1980s bubble economy.
Compared with the previous quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.5 percent, more than the median estimate for a 0.3 percent increase and following a 0.2 percent contraction in January-March.
In a sign the economic recovery was broadening, domestic demand was the main driver of growth.
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy, was the biggest contributor, rising 0.7 percent on brisk demand for cars and home appliances, the data showed.
The gain was more than the median estimate for a 0.2 percent increase and marked a rebound from a revised 0.2 percent fall in the first quarter, it showed.
""For the third and fourth quarters, we've penciled in similar growth to the second quarter, but the risks are a bit to the downside,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The economy is running into capacity constraints. We are quite certain there will be some sort of tariffs on Japanese cars. It's a question of how much.""
Many industries face labor shortages due to a rapidly ageing population. This helps push up wages but has also caused capacity constraints because some companies are shortening operating hours due to a lack of workers.
Japan certainly needs higher consumer spending to push up inflation, but with consumer prices taking so long to rise, economists have pushed back the timeframe in which they expect the BOJ to unwind monetary easing until 2020 or later, a Reuters poll on Thursday showed.
Capital expenditure rose 1.3 percent, exceeding market forecasts for a 0.6 percent increase and marking the biggest gain since October-December 2016.
The external environment, however, was less favorable, even without any direct impact to exports from increasing trade hostilities between the United States and its major trading partners over the quarter.
External demand, or exports minus imports, subtracted 0.1 percentage point from growth, missing expectations for a 0.1 percentage point contribution.
""If the trade conflict heightens uncertainty over the outlook, companies could rein in spending, even if Washington does not impose higher tariffs on Japanese goods,"" Yusuke Ichikawa, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing Tokyo to sign a bilateral free-trade agreement and has threatened to impose higher tariffs on auto imports including those from Japan.
The two countries failed to reach any consensus in talks on Thursday between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who stuck to Tokyo's position that it preferred multilateral free-trade agreements over bilateral ones.
Trump is trying to re-negotiate the U.S. trade relationship with other countries to curb practices that he says are unfair to American companies and workers.
This has led to an increase in tensions between the United States and China as the world's two largest economies slap retaliatory tariffs on each other.

Japan has repeatedly said it prefers multilateral trade negotiations, which puts it at loggerheads with the United States.

On a quarterly basis, GDP in January-March expanded 2.2 percent from the previous period. The economists did not provide quarterly estimates.
""We expect economic growth may slow down a bit in the second half,"" said Thomas Shik, Chief Economist and Head of Economic Research of Global Markets, at Hang Seng Bank. 
""The market will be more concerned about the government's forecast for the second half of the year."" 
The government, which is due to report GDP figures later on Friday, has forecast full-year growth at 3-4 percent.
The financial hub's trade-reliant economy could get caught in the cross-fire of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, Hong Kong's largest trade partner, with trade and logistics industries particularly vulnerable.
The Hong Kong government said in July that HK$130 billion ($16.56 billion) worth of trade could be affected by the trade war, accounting for 3.5 percent of the Chinese-ruled city's total exports.
While uncertainty over the impact of the trade war has cast a cloud over the outlook, Hong Kong is still bolstered by strong consumer spending amid a tight labor market and solid growth in visitor arrivals, in particular from the mainland.
As one of the most open and free economies in the world, Hong Kong's growth is highly reliant on capital, trade, tourist and investment flows from China. 
Hong Kong has hovered near full employment with a jobless rate of 2.8 percent in April-June, the lowest level in two decades. 
The red hot property sector, however, is also seen by analysts as a potential risk, with the financial hub's top banks set to raise mortgage rates on Monday. 

The former British colony tracks U.S. rate moves because its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar, and higher mortgage rates are expected to pressure borrowers and raise the risk of a slowdown in the real estate sector.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting that a strong economy was helping the labor market weather ongoing trade tensions between the United States and a host of other countries. 
Other data on Thursday showed a solid increase in underlying producer prices in July. Labor market strength and rising inflation likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in September for the third time this year.
""Trade war tensions in the clouds out there on the horizon may still move closer to shore later this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Aug. 4, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
The claims data is being closely watched for signs of layoffs as a result of the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has left the United States embroiled in tit-for-tat tariffs with major trade partners including China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union.
Washington imposed duties on steel and aluminum imports, provoking retaliation by the nation's trade partners. The United States has also slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, with Beijing responding in kind. Manufacturers are increasingly complaining about more expensive steel and aluminum raising production costs, as well as causing disruptions to the supply chain.
There have been reports of some companies either laying off workers or planning job cuts because of the import tariffs. 
Claims dropped to 208,000 during the week ended July 14, which was the lowest reading since December 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week.
""We are yet to see any effect of anti-trade policies on employment,"" said Pooja Sriram, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""Forward-looking business surveys have flagged concerns over protectionism in recent months, but show that firms' hiring intentions remain in place.""
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.

SOLID CORE PPI GAIN
The economy created 157,000 jobs in July, a step-down from the 248,000 positions added in June. The slowdown in hiring likely reflected a shortage of qualified workers. A report on Tuesday showed there were 6.7 million unfilled jobs in June. 
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components rose 0.3 percent last month. The so-called core PPI rose by the same margin in June. 
In the 12 months through July, the core PPI increased 2.8 percent after rising 2.7 percent in June. The strong labor market and robust economy are pushing up inflation. Import duties are also seen boosting price pressures. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.9 percent in June. The core PCE price index hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since December 2011.
The Fed raised interest rates in June and has forecast two more hikes by December. Data on Friday is expected to show a steady broad increase in consumer prices in July. 
While overall producer prices were unchanged in July for the first time in seven months, inflation pressures at the factory gate are gradually building up. Intermediate prices for steel mill products rose 1.6 percent in July, lifting the annual increase to 12.4 percent.
""For now, manufacturers are absorbing some of that cost increase,"" said Andrew Hunter, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with more tariffs in the pipeline and capacity utilization high, we suspect that it's only a matter of time before final demand inflation begins to rise more markedly.""
Increases in prices for hotel accommodation, pharmaceutical preparations, hospital inpatient care, apparel, motor vehicles and transporting goods by road last month were offset by declines in the costs of energy products, food, airline fares and hospital outpatient care.
July's unchanged reading in the PPI for final demand followed a 0.3 percent increase in June. In the 12 months through July, the PPI advanced 3.3 percent, slowing after June's 3.4 percent increase. Economists had forecast the PPI gaining 0.2 percent in July and rising 3.4 percent year-on-year.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories edged up 0.1 percent instead of being unchanged as reported last month. That followed a 0.3 percent rise in May and kept the inventory-to-sales ratio at a very low 1.25.

""Stockpiles are being depleted fairly quickly, urging producers to pick up the pace,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>","At bargain prices, European banks attract value-hungry investors","By Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's most shunned stock market sector, banking, is starting to tempt some investors as a string of solid earnings updates persuade them there are cut-price deals to be had. 
Euro zone banks (SX7E) are the worst performing stocks so far this year, down 13 percent as investors shed assets seen as most vulnerable to political upheaval.
At the same time, a boost for the sector in the form of an interest rate hike by the European Central Bank (ECB) still seems far away. 
Yet banks have generally delivered strong second-quarter results, and their low valuations and growing dividend payouts are attracting investors despite the political uncertainty over, for example, Italy's new government and U.S. trade policy. 
Banking shares have still not recovered from the financial crisis: the euro zone bank stocks index is down 75 percent from its 2007 peak, while the broader euro zone stocks index (STOXXE) is just 10 percent away. 
So there is still a long way to go. But that is precisely what is attracting value investors keen to find a bargain before the rest of the market catches on. 
""We have been adding to European banks particularly as we've seen U.S. banks get closer to fair value whereas there's a big disparity in valuations in Europe,"" said Chris Dyer, head of global equity at investment manager Eaton Vance. 
Euro zone bank stocks trade at 0.7 times their book value per share (BPS), half that of the U.S. S&P 500 banks sector. 
And banks' earnings overall have comforted investors.
Some 74 percent of financial sector firms have beaten earnings forecasts this quarterly reporting season, one of the strongest ratios in Europe, Thomson Reuters data shows. 
Profitability is up 22 percent year-on-year, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts say, while credit quality is rising along with loan volumes, despite slowing economic growth in the euro zone.
The bank recommends buying the shares of France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Italy's Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Spain's Sabadell (MC:SABE). 
""Valuations are saying people don't have a lot of confidence in European economic growth and have lost patience with the idea that rates will ever go up,"" said Steve Sherman, senior portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management (BNPPAM). 
But bank stock buyers say they're being paid to wait. The sector offers good dividend yields, with even Britain's state-owned RBS (L:RBS) resuming dividend payouts after 10 years.
""We see a 15 percent upside in the next 12 months for the banking stocks we cover, against an 8.8 percent upside for our broader European coverage,"" said Farhad Moshiri, an analyst covering the sector at researchers Alphavalue. 
Perceived ""value"" stocks such as banks are coming back into vogue as sharp falls in tech giants Facebook (O:FB) and Twitter (N:TWTR) dent confidence in strong-earning ""growth"" stocks.
But even if this marks a turning point in the decade-long dominance of growth over value stocks, risks remain.
Euro zone banks versus US valuations: https://reut.rs/2MAjf0o
VALUE STOCK OR VALUE TRAP?
Between tougher regulations, hefty fines for financial crisis misdemeanours, sluggish growth and political volatility, the euro zone's banks face an uphill struggle to convince many investors.
""There are still a lot of people who see the sector as a value trap,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, which invests in bank equity and debt. 
Political upheaval in Italy in May spooked some investors still concerned about the euro zone's resilience after the sovereign debt crisis, leading them to worry that apparently good value stocks could be a trap leading to further losses. 
""Banks are caught at the crux of that push and pull between earnings and political/trade concerns because banks are levered to future economic growth and political stability,"" said BNPPAM's Sherman.
And while the ECB is expected to start raising rates in about a year, a global crisis - say sparked by a trade war - could further delay a normalization of monetary policy.
""Valuations are cheap, true, but the counter argument is that bank stocks will move only when rates rise,"" said Kairos Partners portfolio manager Federico Trabucco. 
""Mr Market discounts events in advance but probably it’s too early now. We’ve already seen some false banking rallies,"" he added.
The banking sector has attempted - and failed at - a convincing earnings recovery several times over the past decade, and many remain sceptical this time could be different. 
Even bullish investors, like Eaton Vance's Dyer, are exercising caution. He has taken a larger number of smaller positions than normal in order to avoid taking too big a bet on a particular region or lender.
""A lot of those catalysts are binary so we try to spread the risk,"" he said. 
With Italian budget talks also looming in September, some are still waiting for the risks to diminish before wading in.
""I will buy when things get clearer"" is how a lot of investors currently see it, said Axiom's Legras.

The Labor Department said on Thursday the unchanged reading in its producer price index for final demand followed a 0.3 percent increase in June. In the 12 months through July, the PPI advanced 3.3 percent, slowing after June's 3.4 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI increasing 0.2 percent in July and rising 3.4 percent year-on-year.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.3 percent last month. The so-called core PPI rose by the same margin in June.
In the 12 months through July, the core PPI increased 2.8 percent after rising 2.7 percent in June. 
Last month's weak PPI reading is likely temporary against the backdrop of a strong labor market and robust economy. The Trump administration's import tariffs on lumber, steel and aluminum, as well as a range of Chinese goods, are also expected to boost price pressures.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.9 percent in June. The PCE price index hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since December 2011.
In July, prices for goods edged up 0.1 percent after a similar gain in June. Goods prices were lifted by a 0.7 percent increase in the cost of pharmaceutical preparations. There were also increases in the prices of motor vehicles and liquefied petroleum gas, but the cost of electricity fell 1.6 percent. 
There were also decreases in the prices of meat, oilseeds and nonferrous scrap. 
The cost of services dipped 0.1 percent, the biggest drop in seven months, after increasing 0.4 percent in June. A 12.7 percent drop in the index for fuels and lubricants retailing led the decline in the cost of services last month.
The cost of healthcare services edged up 0.1 percent as a 0.4 percent drop in prices for hospital outpatient care was offset by increases in hospital inpatient care. Healthcare prices gained 0.2 percent in June.

Those costs feed into the core PCE price index.

Key Takeaways
The figures, which measure wholesale and other selling prices at businesses, indicate price pressures in the production pipeline were fairly contained at the start of the second half of 2018. While U.S. demand is rising, there’s concern about higher materials costs and persistent uncertainty as the Trump administration imposes tariffs and other nations including China retaliate.
The cost of goods rose 0.1 percent from June, bringing the annual increase to 4.5 percent -- the biggest gain since December 2011, the report showed. Services prices decreased 0.1 percent from the prior month, reflecting lower margins at wholesalers and retailers. Margins for fuels and lubricants retailing dropped 12.7 percent, while cost gauges for machinery and equipment parts wholesaling, hospital outpatient care, and airline passenger services also decreased.
While the consumer price index due Friday is considered a more important indicator of inflation, data on producer prices help provide insights into the direction of input costs that businesses are facing.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 12:27AM ET</span>","China's factory inflation slows, tariffs yet to stoke price pressures","By Stella Qiu and Se Young Lee
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory price inflation cooled in July amid a slowdown in economic growth with Beijing locked in a heated trade dispute with Washington, although economists expect punitive tariffs on U.S goods to add to wider price pressures in months ahead.
The producer price index (PPI) -- a gauge of factory gate inflation -- rose 4.6 percent in July from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). That was slower than 4.7 percent in June but faster than the 4.4 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.
The July inflation data is the first official reading on the impact on prices from China's tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods that went into effect on July 6 and apply to a range of products from soybeans, to mixed nuts and whiskey.
Signs that inflation remains benign will provide some latitude for policymakers who have placed a priority on shoring up the slowing economy through various easing measures.
""Looking ahead, China's retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. and the renminbi's recent depreciation will put some upward pressure on import prices,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economics at Capital Economics.
But while Capital Economics have nudged up their PPI forecasts for this year and the next, they note still significant downward pressures on prices from the challenging trade environment.
""The big picture is that we still think inflation on both (consumer and producer) measures is set to cool during the coming quarters as China's economy slows and commodity prices fall,"" Evans-Pritchard said. ""This should give the People's Bank plenty of room to further loosen monetary policy.""
The NBS attributed the slower producer inflation to smaller increases in metals prices.
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.1 percent in July, compared with a 0.3 percent growth in June.
Raw material prices jumped 9.0 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with an 8.8 percent increase in June. 
Official data on Wednesday showed China's July import growth accelerated to its fastest since January, although the outlook for inbound shipments is clouded by the yuan's sharp drop in recent months. 
The Trump administration tightened pressure for trade concessions from Beijing last week by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China in turn retaliated by proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG), iron ore and steel to aircraft.
On Wednesday, China said it is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment on Aug. 23, but left out crude oil.
German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) last month said it will raise the prices of two U.S.-made crossover sport-utility vehicles in China to cope with the tariffs on U.S. car imports.
But while the tit-for-tat tariffs between China and the U.S. have fueled some worries about the inflation outlook, many analysts believe the impact on consumer prices will be limited.
Consumer inflation picked up from the previous month, largely due to a rise in non-food prices, driven by rising gasoline prices as a result of already-high global crude oil prices. 
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier, beating expectations of 1.9 percent which was unchanged from June's growth, but still within the government's comfort zone of 3 percent. 
On a month-on-month basis, the CPI rose 0.3 percent due to an increase in summer tourism demand.

The food price index rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier, after ticking up 0.3 percent in June. Non-food prices rose 2.4 percent, compared with 2.2 percent growth a month ago.

The producer price index rose 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared with a projected 4.5 percent increase in a Bloomberg survey of economists and a 4.7 percent gain in June. The consumer price index climbed 2.1 percent, the statistics bureau said Thursday, versus the forecast 2 percent rise.
Policy makers’ vows to boost infrastructure investment amid a slowing economy may underpin domestic demand and counter the external risks posed by the tariff wars. Factory-gate prices so far this year have been defying expectations that they’ll ease to about half the pace of 2017.
""Rising prices of energy and other commodities are broadly positive, helping to boost industrial profits and ease deflation and debt concerns,"" Katrina Ell, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in Sydney, wrote in a recent note.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 09:32PM ET</span>","Japan machinery orders tumble, stoke doubts on capex","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders tumbled in June at the fastest pace in six months, with firms expecting another modest drop in the third quarter in a sign capital expenditure may slow, especially as international trade worries cloud the horizon.
The 8.8 percent fall in core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, was more than the median estimate for a 1.3 percent decline in a Reuters poll and marked the biggest drop since December 2017.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office have forecast that core orders will edge down 0.3 percent in July-September after a 2.2 percent increase in April-June.
The machinery orders, which come a day before data expected to show the economy resumed expansion in the second quarter due to robust consumer spending and capital expenditure, may increase policymaker concerns about future growth.
""Machinery orders are moving in line with a temporary slowdown in global manufacturing activity,"" said Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""Japan's economy will continue to grow but at a slightly slower pace. Trade friction is a risk, but there is no substantial impact so far.""
By sector, orders from manufacturers slumped by 15.9 percent in June, after a 1.3 percent increase in May, while service-sector orders decreased 7.0 percent, versus a 0.2 percent increase the previous month.
The Cabinet Office lowered its assessment of machinery orders, saying a recovery in orders has paused. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have expanded at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the second quarter, the Reuters poll of 16 analysts showed.
That would translate to a 0.3 percent expansion in April-June from the previous quarter.
In January-March, the economy shrank at an annualized rate of 0.6 percent, marking the end to eight straight quarters of growth.
Risks to the outlook remain as U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies and his threats to impose tariffs on imported autos and auto parts cloud the prospect for Japan's export-reliant economy.

Japanese companies could cut back on capital expenditure if they think exports will slow due to trade friction with the United States, some economists have said.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","UK house prices inch up, buy-to-let investors exit market: RICS","LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices edged up last month as widespread falls in London weighed on gains further north, while smaller landlords quit the rental sector due to less favorable tax treatment, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' (RICS) monthly house price balance rose to +4 in July from an upwardly revised +3, in line with economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
Prices in Scotland, Northern Ireland and most of central and northern England rose, while prices in London fell broadly -- though not as widely as earlier in the year -- and prices in other parts of southern England and in Wales were flat.
Property priced at over 1 million pounds ($1.29 million) -- which is common only in London and nearby areas -- was the most likely to see discounts of 10 percent or more on its asking price. Houses advertised for under 500,000 pounds typically sold at or slightly above their asking price.
The price trends are similar to those reported by others such as mortgage lender Nationwide, which said prices nationally rose by 2.5 percent in the year to the end of July.
Somewhat faster price rises are expected by surveyors over the next 12 months, but sales volumes are seen falling at the fastest rate since October. Estate agents have few properties to sell, and there has been no pick-up in prospective sellers.
By contrast, RICS members reported a sharp fall in new rental instructions from smaller landlords, who are losing the ability to deduct mortgage interest and many other expenses from their tax bills, and also face higher purchase taxes.
""The impact of recent and ongoing tax changes is clearly having a material impact on the buy-to-let sector as intended. The risk ... is that a reduced pipeline of supply will gradually feed through into higher rents,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
RICS predicted a 2 percent increase in rents over the next 12 months and a 15 percent rise over a five-year period. Average rents rose 0.4 percent over the past year, official data shows.

Former finance minister George Osborne set out initial changes to the taxation of smaller landlords in 2015 to boost falling home-ownership rates. Commercial landlords who own several properties via an investment company are less affected.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. mortgage activity falls to two-and-a-half year low: MBA,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage application activity decreased to its lowest in 2-1/2 years last week as loan requests to refinance an existing home fell to their weakest level since December 2000, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on weekly home loan requests fell 3 percent to 342.5 in the week ended Aug. 3. This was the lowest reading since 328.6 in the week of Jan. 1, 2016.
The decline in home refinancing could be a future drag on domestic consumer spending. Homeowners refinance their homes either to reduce their monthly mortgage payments or to extract cash from the values of their homes.
So far, the drop in refinancing due primarily to higher mortgage rates has yet to hurt household expenditures.
MBA's barometer on mortgage applications for refinancing declined by 4.5 percent to 927.6 last week, which was its lowest in more than 17-1/2 years.
The share of refinancing fell to 36.6 percent of total applications from 37.1 percent the week before. It held above 34.8 percent set in July, which was its smallest share since August 2008.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" home loans, whose balances are $453,100 or less, averaged 4.84 percent, unchanged from a week earlier but up from 4.22 percent at the end of 2017, MBA said.
Most mortgage rates MBA tracks were lower than the previous week.
Meanwhile, MBA's measure on loan applications to buy a home, a proxy on future housing activity, fell 2 percent to 233.1 in the latest week, which was the lowest since 225.5 in the week of Feb. 16. 

Home sales and construction have softened in recent months as a result of rising borrowing costs, tight housing inventories and expensive home prices.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:47AM ET</span>",Chinese exports accelerate even as Trump escalates trade war,"By Elias Glenn and Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports surged more than expected in July despite U.S. duties and its closely watched surplus with the United States remained near record highs, as the world's two major economic powers ramp up a bitter dispute that some fear could derail global growth.
In the latest move by President Donald Trump to put pressure on Beijing to negotiate trade concessions, Washington is set to begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23. 
In a statement on its official website late on Wednesday, China's commerce ministry criticized the U.S. move as being ""unreasonable"", saying it had no choice but to adopt the same measure on an equal amount of American goods ranging from oil and steel products to autos and medical equipment.
Wednesday's Chinese data provide the first readings of the overall trade picture for the world's second-largest economy since U.S duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports came into effect on July 6.
All the same, China's exports for July rose a bigger than expected 12.2 percent year-on-year, showing little tariff impact for now and beating June's 11.2 percent rise and analysts expectations in a Reuters poll for 10 percent growth.
Of more direct consequence in the Sino-U.S. trade war, China's surplus with the United States shrank only marginally to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticized China's trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. 
Those demands could get even more strident if the yuan's sharp drop in recent months raises the ire of the United States, which has in the past repeatedly criticized Beijing for manipulating its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage. 
Economists say China appears to be taking a more hands-off approach to the yuan, which marked its worst 4-month fall on record between April and July and has provided some reprieve for exporters in the face of the rising trade tensions. 
ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang said Beijing will likely resist using its closely managed currency as a tool in the trade war. 
""Currency devaluation, which may have helped exports to some extent, has been largely market-driven in our view and is not a preferred policy tool by Chinese policy makers as part of the retaliation measures,"" Wang said. 
China's trade with the U.S. also continued to rise in July despite the tariffs, with exports up 11.2 percent year-on-year, and imports increasing 11.1 percent. 
Analysts still expect a less favorable overall trade balance for China in coming months given it's early days in the tariff brawl. 
BEIJING BOOSTS LIQUIDITY SUPPORT
After a strong start to the year, growth in the world's second-largest economy cooled slightly in the second quarter, partly hit by the government's years-long efforts to tackle debt risks.
China's imports rose 27.3 percent year-on-year in July, in a sign domestic demand remains solid, but the worry is that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, rising corporate bankruptcies, and a steep decline in the yuan could put a significant dent on the economy. 
The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more ""active"" fiscal policy.
World financial markets have taken a battering in recent months as fears grow that Trump's ""America First"" policies could derail a global economic revival.
Several large American companies have said they would adjust their supply chains to source outside of China if tariffs on Chinese goods impacted them, while China's Haier Group (HK:1169) said rising steel prices amid hefty U.S. import tariffs was driving up costs for its business in America. 
In a sign there may be more difficulties ahead, a private survey last week found that the business outlook among Chinese services firms was the second-weakest on record in July in part due worries about the trade war.
""STICK OF HEGEMONY"" 
China has repeatedly warned it will strike back against any further punitive measures by Trump, saying the United States is threatening the global free trade order with its protectionism.
Chinese state media, reflecting the government's stance, has said China will not be cowed in the face of U.S. threats. 
The latest commentary from state media on Wednesday took a softer line after resorting to personal attacks against Trump earlier in the week, saying China could get through the storm but refrained from directly mentioning the U.S. president.
All China's main state newspapers published a lengthy commentary by the official Xinhua news agency, entitled ""declaration"", on their front pages.
""Certain people go against the tide for their own private ends and go against morality; the barrier of tariffs wantonly rise, and the stick of hegemony is raised all around,"" the commentary said.
""Although this may for a moment bring preening with delight, it will make it hard to resolve economic imbalances or out of kilter politics and other deep-rooted problems,"" it said.
China has not yet given a date for its previously announced retaliatory tariffs on $16 billion in U.S. goods, which will target commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, coal and some refined oil products.
The latest $16 billion list from the United States will hit semiconductors from China, even though many of the basic chips in these products originate from the United States, Taiwan or South Korea.
John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in a statement they were disappointed and puzzled why semiconductors remain on the final tariff list.

""We have made the case to the Administration, in the strongest possible terms, that tariffs imposed on semiconductors imported from China will hurt America's chipmakers, not China's, and will do nothing to stop China's problematic and discriminatory trade practices,"" he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports growth unexpectedly accelerated in July despite fresh U.S. tariffs, while its trade surplus with the United States remained near record highs as Beijing and Washington ramped up a bitter dispute that has rattled financial markets.
Imports also rose much faster in July thanks to still solid domestic demand, official data showed on Wednesday, with purchases of commodities like copper and iron ore rising from June.
The headline numbers are the first readings of the overall trade picture for the world's second-largest economy since U.S duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports came into effect on July 6.
China's closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticized China's trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment. 
The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34billion worth of each other's goods in July. Since then, Washington and Beijing have raised the stakes by threatening more punitive trade measures in an intensifying dispute that has rattled financial markets worried about the impact on investment and growth. 
The two sides have shown no signs of letting up, with the U.S. earlier Wednesday saying it will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23, and Chinese media resorting to personal attacks against Trump earlier in the week.
China's July exports rose 12.2 percent from a year earlier, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll, and up from a 11.2 percent gain in June.
A weaker yuan, which marked its worst 4-month fall on record between April and July, may have taken the sting out of 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion exports to the United States. However, analysts still expect a less favorable trade balance for China in coming months given it's early days in the tariff brawl.
""Looking ahead, we expect export growth to cool in the coming months, though this will primarily reflect softer global growth rather than US tariffs, the direct impact of which will continue to be mostly offset by the renminbi's (yuan's) recent depreciation,"" Capital Economics' Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note.

Imports grew 27.3 percent in July, customs said, beating analysts' forecast of 16.2 percent growth, and compared with a 14.1 percent rise in June.
TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. NEAR RECORD 
China's exports to the United States rose 13.3 percent in the first seven months of 2018 from a year earlier, compared with a 13.5 percent rise in Jan-June. Its imports from the U.S. rose 11.8 percent in the same period.
The trade balance between the two countries, which is at the center of the tariffs tussle, continued to be in favor of China.
In July the surplus with the United States was at $28.09 billion, down a touch from $28.93 billion in June, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data released on Wednesday.
The surplus with the United States was higher than China's overall trade surplus in July, which was $28.05 billion, indicating China ran a net trade deficit with the world excluding the U.S.
Economists had forecast the surplus would be $39.33 billion in July, compared to a surplus of $41.47 billion in June. 
For January-July, the surplus with the U.S. rose to $161.63 billion, compared with about $142.75 billion in the same period last year.
The Trump administration ramped up the pressure for trade concessions from Beijing last week by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China in turn retaliated by proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, with the extra levies ranging from 5 to 25 percent.
China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of China's annual imports of American products. Last year, China imported about $130 billion of U.S. goods.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports surged more than expected in July despite fresh U.S. duties and its closely watched surplus with the United States remained near record highs, as Washington finalised its new tariff list in a bitter dispute that some fear could derail global growth.
In the latest move by President Donald Trump to put pressure on Beijing to negotiate trade concessions, Washington is set to begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23. Both countries have already slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion of each other's goods.

1281,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 12:12AM ET</span>","China Imports Jump, Exports Robust as Trade War Yet to Take Toll","(Bloomberg) -- China’s exports grew faster than expected, while imports surged, showing both domestic and international demand continue to rise despite the uncertainty of trade relations with the U.S.
Exports rose 12.2 percent in July in dollar terms from a year earlier, the customs administration said Wednesday, faster than the forecast 10 percent. Imports climbed 27.3 percent, leaving a trade surplus of $28 billion.
As the world’s largest exporter, China is still benefiting from robust global demand, but increasing tensions and rising trade barriers with the U.S. are weighing on the outlook. Although most the threatened tariffs still haven’t gone into effect, the two are locked in an escalating tit for tat exchange.
“The higher than expected imports were pushed up by energy prices, which narrowed the trade balance,” said Iris Pang, greater China economist at ING Wholesale Banking in Hong Kong. “The impact of tariffs on exports is yet to be reflected. We will see a full-month tariff effect in August.”
The Chinese government last week announced its list of $60 billion worth of U.S. goods it will hit with higher import taxes should the U.S. follow through on a plan to impose duties on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. That follows a previous round, where each side imposes tariffs on $34 billion of imports, with promises of $16 billion more.
In the meantime, China’s economy is showing signs of weakness -- the yuan has been on a losing streak for more than a month, the equity market has suffered declines, and other early indicators are pointing to a slowdown. The central bank has made it more expensive to bet against the currency in a bid to ease pressure on the currency.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","UK firms struggle to hire with Brexit, record low jobless rate","LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people recruited for permanent jobs in Britain grew at its slowest pace in nine months in July, reflecting record low unemployment and a shortage of migrant workers from the European Union, a recruiters' body said on Wednesday.
A monthly survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) showed there was no lack of appetite for hiring among employers, as the number of vacancies grew at the fastest pace since November 2017.
Britain's unemployment rate has tumbled to its lowest level since 1975 at 4.2 percent and many employers have reported a shortage of EU migrants available for work since the Brexit vote in June 2016.
An REC spokeswoman said companies were continuing to flag the problem of fewer EU candidates for jobs in Britain.
Official data has shown that the number of EU immigrants to Britain fell to a five-year low last year.
The REC survey showed rising pay for newly hired permanent staff, albeit to a lesser extent than in previous months.
""With our data showing starting salaries continuing to rise, the latest official government figures suggest that we are finally seeing the effects of a tighter labor market feed through to pay,"" Sophie Wingfield, head of policy at REC, said.
Employers picked up the pace of hiring of temporary workers and their pay rose too, REC said. 

The Bank of England said last week it expected pay growth for the workforce as a whole to increase gradually over the next three years as Britain's economy operates close to full capacity. This risk of the economy overheating was why it raised borrowing costs for only the second time since the global financial crisis.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings hover at record highs in June,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings held near record highs in June amid a modest decline in hiring, pointing to further tightening labor market conditions, which economists hope will soon spur faster wage growth.
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday underscored labor market strength, which together with robust economic growth, likely paves the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in September.
""The labor market continues to run hot and this guarantees that more rate hikes are on the way,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Fed officials are increasingly skeptical that this economy requires any monetary policy support whatsoever.""
The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in June for the second time this year. The Fed forecast two more rate hikes by December. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 6.7 million in June. Vacancies hit an all-time high of 6.8 million in April.
The job openings rate was unchanged at 4.3 percent in June. There were an additional 20,000 jobs in the education sector, but vacancies declined by 84,000 jobs in the transportation,
warehousing, and utilities industry. There have been reports of a widespread shortage of truck drivers.
There are concerns that the worker shortage will at some point hinder economic growth. The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years.
In June, hiring slipped by 96,000 to 5.7 million. The hiring rate dipped to 3.8 percent from 3.9 percent in May. But hiring in the finance and insurance industry increased by 31,000 in June. 
While the number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs fell by 78,000 to 3.4 million in June, the quits rate, which policymakers and economists view as a measure of job market confidence, held at 2.3 percent for a fourth straight month.
""An elevated quit rate has important implications for income growth because workers typically secure new jobs paying about 5 percent to 10 percent more than their previous jobs,"" said Dante DeAntonio, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""And employers will need to attract workers with better offers.""
Wage growth as measured by average hourly earnings has remained moderate, increasing 2.7 percent year-on-year in July. The JOLTS report also showed layoffs increasing to 1.7 million in June from 1.6 million in May. That lifted the layoffs rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 1.2 percent.

""The June figure was on the high end of the range reported over the past two years, but still low by historic standards,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","India doubles import tax on textile products, may hit China","By Rajendra Jadhav and Sudarshan Varadhan
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India doubled the import tax on more than 300 textile products to 20 percent on Tuesday as the world's biggest producer of cotton tries to curb rising imports from China.
It was the second tax hike on textiles in as many months after an increase on other products including fiber and apparels last month.
The moves are expected to provide relief to the domestic textile industry, which has been hit by cheaper imports. India's total textile imports jumped by 16 percent to a record $7 billion in the fiscal year to March 2018. Of this, about $3 billion were from China.
The government did not disclose details of the 328 textile products that will be subject to the duty increase announced on Tuesday.
Rising imports sent India's trade deficit with China in textile products to a record high $1.54 billion in 2017/18, alarming industry officials as India had been until recently a net exporter of textile products to China.
Sanjay Jain, president of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, told Reuters he did not expect China to retaliate to the Indian duty increases as it still has a trade surplus with India.
He said India's textile product imports could fall to $6 billion in 2018/19 as a result of the tax hike to 20 percent.
India's imports of textile products from Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia also jumped in the last few years as they are not subject to any duty under free trade agreements (FTA) signed by India with these countries.
The 20 percent duty will not be applicable to products sourced from those countries due to the FTA, Jain said.
Industry officials say in the last few months Chinese fiber has been shipped to Bangladesh and processed and exported to India with zero duty.
""Rules of origin need to be implemented for textile products. Otherwise Chinese products will land from other countries,"" said a Mumbai-based garment exporter, who declined to be named.
Jain said India's textile and garment exports could rise 8 percent to $40 billion in 2018/19 due to a weak rupee and as the government is expected to introduce incentives to boost overseas sales.
India's trade differences with the United States have also been rising since President Donald Trump took office.

India, the world's biggest buyer of U.S. almonds, in June decided to raise import duties on almonds and some other U.S. imports by 20 percent, joining the European Union and China in retaliating against Trump's tariff hikes on steel and aluminum. The increased tariff on U.S. goods will be applicable from Sept. 18.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy is set for modest growth in the second quarter after industrial output edged up and job vacancies hit a record high, underlining labor market strength that is fuelling a consumer-led upswing. 
Europe's biggest economy saw vacancies surge by 25,000 on the quarter and 115,000 on the year to reach 1.21 million in the April-June period, a survey by the IAB labor office research institute found.
Asked for the main reasons that are complicating recruitment, most employers pointed to a shortage of applicants and insufficient job qualifications.
Separate data on Tuesday from the Economy Ministry showed industrial output rose 0.4 percent on the quarter in the April-June period despite a weaker-than-expected reading for June.
That release followed data on Monday that showed German industrial orders dropped in June by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years, suggesting that trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump could limit growth.
""June's industrial production and trade figures suggest that the previously booming German economy is already feeling the effects of trade tensions,"" said Jennifer McKeown at London-based Capital Economics.
""But with the domestic economy in good shape and given the recent ceasefire in the tariff war, we expect only a modest slowdown in German growth.""
In June alone, industrial output fell 0.9 percent, missing a Reuters forecast for a drop on the month of 0.5 percent. That came after a downwardly revised rise of 2.4 percent in May.
""That's not a great result, but it could have been worse,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said. ""In contrast to the first quarter, industrial production supported growth in the second quarter.""
GROWTH EXPECTED
The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth data for the second quarter next Tuesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters on average expect the quarterly growth rate to edge up to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in January-March, driven by private consumption and construction.
The German economy expanded by a robust 2.5 percent in 2017 and most analysts expect only a moderate slowdown to around 2 percent this year.
The Federal Statistics Office said in a separate statement that seasonally adjusted exports were unchanged on the month in June while imports rose by 1.2 percent.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3 billion euros from an upwardly revised 20.4 billion euros ($23.60 billion) in May.
Trump has agreed to refrain from imposing tariffs on cars imported from the EU while the two sides negotiate to cut other trade barriers.

The decision, reached in talks between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington last month, eased fears of a transatlantic trade war.

Vacancies surged by 25,000 on the quarter and by 115,000 on the year to reach 1.21 million in the April-June period, a survey by the IAB labor office research institute found.
Industrial output data released earlier on Tuesday and industrial orders figures on Monday suggested German economic growth weakened towards the end of the second quarter as a result of trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Asked for the main reasons that are complicating recruitment, most employers pointed to a lack of applicants and insufficient job qualifications, the survey showed.
On average, there are almost three job vacancies in Germany for every 100 employees with a labor contract that includes contributions to the state's social security system. In 2012, there were only two vacancies.
""This shows that demand for staff has significantly increased,"" IAB said in a research note.
Germany's labor market is booming, with employment reaching record highs. An unusually long economic growth cycle, now in its ninth year, coupled with a shortage of working-age people, means many companies are running out of suitable staff.
Many firms are facing difficulties in filling their training positions, with a recent survey by the German Chambers of Commerce showing more than a third of German companies could not fill all of their training places last year. Almost one in ten received no applications for such roles.
The IW German Economic Institute estimated in April that the shortage of manpower is costing the economy up to 0.9 percentage points of output a year.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government plans to pass an immigration law this year that aims to help skilled workers from outside the European Union to come to Germany and apply for a job.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 01:18AM ET</span>",Australia's central bank celebrates second anniversary of policy inactivity,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank has marked two whole years with no move in interest rates, the longest policy pause in its modern history, as optimism on the economy is tempered by miserly wage growth and muted inflation.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its August policy meeting on Tuesday with rates held at a record low of 1.50 percent, and showed every intention of keeping them there.
""Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement, reiterating his previous outlook.
""Gradual"" is the watchword as inflation stays stubbornly below its 2-3 percent target band and wages only barely keep up with inflation despite solid job gains.
The economy grew a surprisingly brisk 3.1 percent in the year to March and recent robust data on retail sales and trade suggest it maintained momentum through the June quarter.
The bank will issue updated economic forecasts this Friday and Lowe offered a taster on the outlook, noting that inflation would likely be softer than expected in the second half of this year due to declines in government-set prices.
He was more upbeat on the jobs outlook.
""A further gradual decline in the unemployment rate is expected over the next couple of years to around 5 percent,"" said Lowe, extending the forecast out to the end of 2020.
That was an improvement on the previous call of 5.25 percent, but still a glacial decline from the current 5.4 percent. Strong growth in the workforce, driven partly by rapid migration, has tended to keep the jobless rate up.
OVER THE HORIZON AND FAR AWAY
A Reuters poll of 38 analysts had found all but one expected cash rates to be left unchanged this week, and an increase was not expected before the third quarter of 2019. [AU/INT]
Financial markets have steadily pushed out the likely timing of a move, with interbank futures implying around a 50-50 probability of a hike by August next year.
The domestic case for a hike has also been weakened by a sharp slowdown in the once red-hot housing market in Sydney and Melbourne. A clamp-down by regulators on investment loans and tighter lending standards by banks mean house prices nationally are now falling for the first time since 2012.
Sydney prices were down 5.4 percent in July, from a year earlier, according to data out last week from property consultant Core Logic. At the peak of the boom, they had been rising by more than 20 percent annually.
Some small and medium-sized banks have been raising mortgage rates to cover higher funding costs in the wholesale market, though two of the majors have actually trimmed their rates in a push for greater market share.
Given Australia's housing stock is valued at A$6.9 trillion ($5.10 trillion), a sustained fall in prices would be a negative for household wealth and spending power.
""Our forecast that house prices will fall by 12 percent over four years implies this will be the largest and longest housing downturn in Australia's modern history,"" warned Paul Dales, chief Australia economist at Capital Economics.
""Against that backdrop, we doubt that households will remain resilient.""

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 11:37PM ET</span>","Japan wage growth hits 21-year high, signals pickup in household spending","By Leika Kihara and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending slid in June but real wages rose at their fastest pace in more than 21 years thanks to higher summer bonuses, a sign the benefits of a prolonged economic recovery are broadening.
Household income also marked the fastest gain in three years on an increase in temporary workers' pay, offering some hope for Bank of Japan policymakers struggling to accelerate inflation to their elusive 2 percent target.
The figures come ahead of Friday's release of second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data, which will likely show the economy expanded an annualized 1.4 percent after contracting in the previous quarter.
""Consumption has emerged from a soft patch in the first quarter and will underpin economic growth,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Export growth is stagnating, so we may not see external demand drive the economy. But that will be offset by strong capital expenditure and improvements in consumption.""
Household spending fell 1.2 percent in June from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, marking the fifth straight month of declines. But the fall was smaller than market forecasts of a 1.6 percent slide and a 3.9 percent drop in May.
While spending on housing renovations fell, consumers spent more on beverages, air conditioners and eat-outs due partly to hot weather during the month, the data showed.
""Household spending continued to fall but we're seeing some positive signs,"" said a government official who briefed reporters on the data, adding that spending may turn up in July as households spend their bonuses handed out at the end of June.
Households' inflation-adjusted income rose 4.4 percent in June, the biggest increase since July 2015, as a tightening job market pushed up temporary workers' pay, the data showed.
Separate data showed workers' real wages rose 2.8 percent in June from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.3 percent increase in May and marking the fastest pace of growth since January 1997.
Signs of rising wages would be encouraging for the BOJ, which trimmed its inflation forecasts last week and blamed Japan's entrenched deflationary mindset for keeping price growth subdued.
Private consumption has been a soft spot in the economy as slow wage growth prevents households from loosening their purse strings, in turn discouraging companies from hiking prices and keeping inflation far from the BOJ's 2 percent target.
Although companies may now be finally raising wages to address a tightening job market, their business prospects could be clouded by escalating protectionism and fears the United States may impose auto import tariffs that would devastate Japan's exports.
Some analysts warn that growth may be peaking for Japan's economy, which had enjoyed the longest streak of expansion since the 1980s bubble economy before shrinking in January-March.
Factory output fell 2.1 percent in June, marking the second straight month of decline. Toyota Motor Corp said higher U.S. auto tariffs would ramp up the cost of vehicles produced locally and those imported from Japan.
Such risks could cast a cloud over the BOJ's assumption that continued economic expansion would push inflation to its target.
Economists polled by Reuters expect core consumer prices to rise just 1.0 percent in the next fiscal year to March 2020, far below the BOJ's projection of 1.5 percent.

The 2.8 percent rise in real wages in June from a year earlier was the biggest gain since a 6.2 percent annual increase in January 1997, and followed a 1.3 percent annual increase in May, labor ministry data showed on Tuesday.
The data should be encouraging to the Bank of Japan as it struggles to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target despite more than five years of massive monetary stimulus.
Nominal cash earnings rose 3.6 percent year-on-year in June, faster than a 2.1 percent annual increase in May.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, grew 1.5 percent in June from a year earlier. Special one-off payments, which include summer bonuses, jumped an annual 7.0 percent.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, rose an annual 3.5 percent in June versus a revised 2.0 percent increase in May.
Major Japanese firms typically pay bonuses twice a year, once during the summer and once near year's end.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

Total retail sales values rose by 1.6 percent compared with July 2017, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said, the weakest increase since February, excluding a fall in April which was distorted by the timing of Easter.
""Last month's sweltering temperatures kept shoppers focused on eating, drinking and keeping cool. Food sales had their best July in five years, while fans and cooling equipment flew off the shelves,"" Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said.
""However, total sales growth slowed as the heat laid bare the underlying weakness in consumer spending.""
Non-food retail sales fell after rising in the previous two months, the BRC said.
British shoppers, whose spending accounts for about 80 percent of the economy, have seen inflation rise faster than their pay for much of the past decade, although in recent months growth in earnings has turned positive in real terms.
Separately on Tuesday, Barclaycard the credit and debit card division of  Barclays  (L:BARC), said its measure of consumer spending -- which includes bars and restaurants -- rose by an annual 5.0 percent in July , driven by shopping in supermarkets and an increase in fuel prices.
Pub spending rose by nearly 17 percent, the most since April last year, helped by the World Cup.
""It will be interesting to see if this strong level of growth continues,"" Barclaycard director Esme Harwood said.
""It's clear that some consumers remain cautious about what's to come with interest rates rising and overall confidence in household finances down slightly from June.""

The Bank of England last week raised its benchmark interest rate for only the second time since the financial crisis more than a decade ago but stressed it would continue to raise borrowing costs only gradually.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro stopped publishing economic indicators nearly three years ago as Venezuela's socialist economic system started falling apart, making opposition legislators the only source of such figures.
The International Monetary Fund last month estimated that Venezuela's consumer prices would rise 1,000,000 percent in 2018.
Inflation in July slowed slightly to 125 percent from 128.4 percent in June, according to opposition legislator Angel Alvarado.
Maduro, who was reelected in May in a vote that dozens of foreign governments described as rigged, is preparing to remove five zeroes from the country's currency in an effort to keep up with inflation.

He insists the election was free and fair and says the situation is the result of an ""economic war"" led by the opposition and business leaders who are arbitrarily raising prices.

The trade dispute with the United States, rising corporate borrowing costs, and a steep decline in the value of the yuan versus the dollar have raised concerns that the world's second-largest economy could face a steeper slowdown.
Chinese banks were estimated to have doled out 1.2 trillion yuan ($175.4 billion) in new yuan loans in July, easing from a five-month high of 1.84 trillion yuan in June, according to a Reuters survey of 36 analysts.
But the expected July tally looks solid comparing to 825.5 billion yuan a year earlier. Chinese banks usually make few loans in July after traditionally ramping up lending in June.
Broad M2 money supply was seen rising 8.2 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating from June's 8 percent rise, which was the lowest on record, according to the poll.
Annual growth of outstanding loans was seen quickening to 12.8 percent in July from 12.7 percent in June.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has been pumping out more cash to encourage bank lending but it faces difficulty in channeling credit to small firms, which are vital for economic growth and job creation, analysts said.
State banks remain reluctant to lend to small firms, which are considered riskier than state-controlled firms.
The PBOC has cut banks' reserve requirements three times this year, with the latest reduction on July 5 freeing up 700 billion yuan in liquidity. It also lent a net 905.5 billion yuan to financial institutions via its medium-term lending facility (MLF) in June and July, central bank data showed.
CRACKDOWN ON SHADOW LOANS
A central bank adviser said last week China should limit the credit impact of its financial deleveraging drive, voicing concern that tightening may have gone too far.
Annual growth in China's outstanding total social financing (TFS), which includes off-balance sheet forms of financing, slowed to 9.8 percent in June, the lowest on record, according to central bank data.
Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted bankers' acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking finance, shrank by 1.26 trillion yuan in the first six months, central bank data showed.
Commercial firms remain reluctant to make loans to small firms, which are considered to be riskier than state-owned firms.
China's economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter and July factory surveys pointed to further slowing in activity.
Policy advisers have said that Beijing plans to put more money into infrastructure projects and ease borrowing curbs on local governments to support the slowing economy.
China's central bank is due to release July lending and money supply data between August 10 and 15.

The data from the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), which was reported by local media on Monday, also showed that overall sales of imported cars during the first half of 2018 fell 22.1 percent year-on-year to 451,971 vehicles. 
CADA published the June data last week and has yet to release July figures. 
In May, China announced that it would steeply cut import tariffs for foreign-made automobiles and car parts to 15 percent from 25 percent from July 1.
It, however, in July raised tariffs on cars imported from the United States to 40 percent amid rising trade tensions with Washington.
""June was the most impacted month,"" said Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association's import committee.
""Many car dealers held back their import orders and decided not to import until July 1,"" he said. 
China imported 1.25 million cars last year, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. 
The tariff cuts announced in May prompted many automakers such as Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) to say at the time that they would look at adjusting their retail prices in China to provide competitive offers to customers. 

However, firms affected by the higher duties on cars imported from the U.S. such as BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Ford (N:F) later decided to take a profitability hit rather than raises prices fully on U.S.-produced SUVs.

The Federal Statistics Office said on Monday that contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods fell by 4.0 percent after an increase of 2.6 percent the previous month.
The June reading, the biggest fall in German industrial orders since January 2017, undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a 0.4 percent decrease.
""Disappointing new orders data show tentative signs of trade tensions hitting the German economy, which doesn't bode well for the industrial outlook in the second half of the year,"" ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said.
The overall drop in industrial orders was driven by a 4.7 percent decline in foreign demand, with orders from countries outside the euro zone falling the most.
A sector breakdown showed that orders for capital goods and consumer goods came in particularly weak.
The Economy Ministry said that industrial orders fell by 1.6 percent on the quarter in the April-June period. It also pointed to trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

""Regarding the latest development, uncertainty caused by trade policy probably played a role,"" the ministry said.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 02:01AM ET</span>",China's July exports growth still seen holding up despite U.S. tariffs: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports are expected to have maintained solid growth in July despite new tariffs on billions of dollars of shipments to the United States, though the outlook has darkened as both sides raised the stakes in a trade conflict that has rattled financial markets.
China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft on Friday, following a proposal by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump for a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. 
The increasingly heated rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has rattled global markets worried about the impact on world trade and growth, with few signs either side is willing to make significant concessions. 
Economists say that tariffs on $34 billion of China's exports to the United States, which went into effect on July 6, so far are not having a significant impact on overall Chinese exports. 
July exports are predicted to have risen 10 percent year-on-year, according to median estimates from 37 economists, compared to 11.2 percent growth in June. While July's forecast does not point to any sharp slowdown, economists do see headwinds mounting for China's massive export sector. 
""In addition to the tariffs impact, there might be some impact from front-loading of orders in previous months,"" said Betty Wang, Senior China Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong. 
""There will be some gradual impacts that could be seen over the following months, as this is the first month the tariffs were implemented."" 
ANZ forecasts China's exports rose 6.4 percent in July. 
SORE POINT 
Markets will be closely watching the data on two-way trade between the world's two biggest economies, as well as China's trade surplus with the United States, a sore point in the trade relationship.
The $34 billion of Chinese exports impacted by current tariffs amount to less than 7 percent of its total exports to the United States last year. Trump, however, has effectively threatened to slap tariffs on all of China's shipments to the United States, the Asian giant's largest export market. 
China's surplus with the U.S. swelled to a record in June as exports continued to rise, though signs of front-loading orders suggest the spike may have been a one-off.
China's imports are expected to have risen 16.2 percent in July, picking up from 14.1 percent growth in June. 
The poll showed China's overall trade surplus likely fell to $39.33 billion in July, from $41.61 billion in June, though that amount would be China's second-highest surplus of the year. 
There was no separate forecast on China's trade surplus with the United States which has continued to grow even as its total surplus has narrowed over the last two years.
China ran a $375 billion goods trade surplus with the United States in 2017, which Trump has said is unacceptable. 
Chinese officials have vowed to retaliate against any further U.S. measures, though they have also taken steps in recent weeks to shore up economic growth and have warned of the risks of job losses as a result of the trade war. 
These measures could help mitigate a broader impact to economic growth, economists say. 
""China has made it very clear it is going to boost infrastructure investment for the second half of the year,"" said ANZ's Wang.

""That would support overall GDP growth momentum even though we see more downside risk and uncertainties around the export sector.""

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 55.7 in July, from 59.1 the previous month.
Economists had forecast a reading of 58.6.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector, and a reading below 50 signals contraction.
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index decreased to 56.5 last month, 7.4 points below June’s reading of 63.9.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July likely due to companies' struggles to find qualified workers and the unemployment rate declined, pointing to tightening labor market conditions.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 157,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 59,000 more jobs in May and June than previously reported. The economy needs to create about 120,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.9 percent in July, even as more people entered the labor force in a sign of confidence in their job prospects. It rose in June from an 18-year low of 3.8 percent in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 190,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate falling to 3.9 percent.
The slowdown in hiring last month likely is not the result of trade tensions, which have escalated in recent days, but rather because of a shortage of workers. There are about 6.6 million unfilled jobs in the nation. A survey of small businesses published on Thursday showed a record number in July of establishments reporting that they could not find workers.
According to the NFIB, the vacancies were concentrated in construction, manufacturing and wholesale trade industries. Small businesses said they were also struggling to fill positions that did not require skilled labor.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report last month showed a scarcity of labor across a wide range of occupations, including highly skilled engineers, specialized construction and manufacturing workers, information technology professionals and truck drivers.
The shortage of workers is steadily pushing up wages.
Average hourly earnings increased seven cents, or 0.3 percent, in July after gaining 0.1 percent in June. That kept the annual increase in wages at 2.7 percent in July.
President Donald Trump's administration has imposed duties on steel and aluminum imports, provoking retaliation by the United States' trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union. It has also slapped 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports.
Beijing fought back with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China. On Wednesday, Trump proposed a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. (Full Story)
Economists have warned that the tit-for-tat import duties, which have unsettled financial markets, could undercut manufacturing through disruptions to the supply chain and put a brake on the strong economic growth.
There have also been concerns that the trade tensions could dampen business confidence and lead companies to shelve spending and hiring plans. But a $1.5 trillion fiscal stimulus, which helped to power the economy to a 4.1 percent annualized growth pace in the second quarter, is assisting the United States in navigating the stormy trade waters.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while painting an upbeat portrait of both the labor market and economy. The U.S. central bank said ""the labor market has continued to strengthen and economic activity has been rising at a strong rate."" The Fed increased borrowing costs in June for the second time this year. (Full Story)
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 1.9 percent in June. The core PCE hit the central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since December 2011.
Manufacturing payrolls rose by 37,000 jobs last month after increasing by 33,000 in June. Construction companies hired 19,000 more workers after increasing payrolls by 13,000 jobs in June. Retail payrolls rebounded by 7,100 jobs last month after losing 20,200 in June.
Government employment fell by 13,000 jobs in July. There were declines in transportation, utilities and financial payrolls last month.

On an annualized basis, wage inflation grew 2.7% in July, in line with expectations for it to hold steady at the prior month’s reading.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a closely-watched gauge of economic activity, dropped to a three-month low of 53.5 in July from 55.1 in June.
Although staying comfortably above the 50 mark signifying growth, July's score was weaker than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of more than 30 economists.
Some companies in the survey attributed the slowdown to a summer heatwave and the soccer World Cup, which kept consumers away from their businesses.
There were also signs that uncertainty around Brexit had held back new business.
The survey comes a day after the BoE hiked interest rates to a new post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent in part because it took the view that the economy had recovered momentum after a weak start to the year caused by unusually bad weather.
Business groups were critical of the decision, and Friday's PMI -- which BoE officials typically get in advance of their policy decision -- will do nothing to assuage their concerns.
The services PMI now stands below its long-term average of 55.1 and is some way off levels that have previously been associated with rising interest rates.
""The service sector moved back into the slow lane in July as business activity growth lost momentum for the first time since the start of spring,"" Tim Moore, associate director at PMI compiler IHS Markit, said.
Services companies hired staff in July at the weakest pace in just under two years.
""Tight labor market conditions and rising wage pressures are also a key challenge for service sector companies, which contributed to the slowest pace of job creation since August 2016,"" Moore said.
The BoE has said it expects wages will rise more quickly and increase inflationary pressure.

IHS Markit's all-sector PMI, which includes services as well as the manufacturing and construction sectors, fell to 53.8 in July from 55.0 in June.

Research firm IHS Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index fell rose to 53.5 last month from 55.1 in June. That compared to forecasts for a reading of 54.7.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that business activity rose at the slowest pace since April, while job creation was the weakest since August 2016.
The research group also noted that inflationary pressures moderated in July.
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector on Wednesday showed that activity grew at the slowest pace in three months in July, while positive sentiment dipped to a 21-month low.
Another report on Thursday showed that construction sector activity accelerated at its fastest pace in more than a year last month.
The Bank of England raised interest rates Thursday despite deepening worries over Brexit, but indicated that any more hikes will be at a “gradual” pace.
The bank said it raised interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown at the start of the year, but warned that Brexit could damage the recovery.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was sluggish at the start of the third quarter as expected, hampered by a drop in new orders that sapped private-sector optimism, a survey showed on Friday.
While the pace of growth was subdued it remained fairly robust and so is unlikely to alter the thinking of policymakers at the European Central Bank, who last week reaffirmed plans to end a 2.6 trillion euro stimulus program.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, fell in July to 54.3 from June's 54.9, matching an earlier preliminary estimate. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The final PMI numbers confirm the euro area economy started quarter three on a softer footing,"" said Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit.
""The outlook seems to be turning into a straight choice between the upturn being sustained at its current subdued pace or rising headwinds reining in growth further during the months ahead. On this front, downside risks are more prevalent.""
A sub-index measuring new orders fell to its second lowest level since the start of last year. And in a sign that firms see little chance of a turnaround anytime soon, the future output index, which measures optimism, fell to a 20-month low of 63.1.
In another ill omen, firms across the bloc increased headcount at a weaker pace last month and built up backlogs of work at the shallowest rate in 1-1/2 years.
Dobson said the PMI pointed to third-quarter growth of around 0.3 percent, little changed from a softer-than-expected expansion of 0.3 percent signaled by official Eurostat data for the second quarter but weaker than the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll. [ECILT/EU]
July's manufacturing PMI, released on Wednesday, showed factory growth remained subdued as worries about trade tensions took a toll. Services firms also suffered a slowdown in growth.
The final PMI for the bloc's dominant services industry fell to 54.2 from June's 55.2, below an earlier flash reading of 54.4.
Services firms suffered a slowdown in new work, with the sub-index falling to 54.1 from 54.9, the second-lowest reading since the start of 2017.

The Markit purchasing managers index's headline figure rose to 52.8 in July from 52.3 in June, remaining above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction since early 2016.
""Following June's recent dip in momentum, July survey data signaled a slight pick-up in business activity growth in the service sector,"" said Sian Jones, economist at IHS Markit that compiles the survey.
""The upturn in new orders also quickened as firms reported greater client demand and increased output following the recent football World Cup,"" Jones said, referring to mid-June to mid-July tournament.
Stronger demand boosted inflation in the sector, with output charges rising at their quickest pace in three months despite a slowdown in input price inflation. Businesses were optimistic as panelists cited an expected increase in activity and planned investment in expansion.

For July, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 52.8, the lowest since March, from June's 53.9. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
The findings were largely in line with those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector released on Tuesday, which showed the services PMI falling in July. 
China is banking on a stronger services sector to offset a smaller contribution from heavy industry and fixed asset investment as policymakers extend a multi-year campaign to crack down on risks, and look to emphasize more sustainable economic growth.
A solid services sector is also important for generating jobs as factories become more automated and the government aims to eliminate industrial overcapacity, which puts some employees out of work.
The services sector already accounts for more than half of China's economy, with rising wages giving its consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
But July's weak new business growth was ""a clear sign that demand for services had worsened"", said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, in a statement accompanying the survey.
The new business sub-index fell to 51.4 in July from 52.7 in June.
With weaker demand growth, prices charged also rose at a slower rate, while input price increases only declined slightly. 
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors also declined in July, coming in at 52.3 compared with the previous month's 53.0 and matching May's reading.
The composite reading showed companies shed workers at the fastest pace since March amid rising cost pressures. 
The outlook for future business was the weakest since November 2015, though recent moves by Beijing to support economic growth should help, said CEBM's Zhong. 
""The sub-index of expectations regarding future output (implied) that confidence of companies, particularly service providers, could use a boost,"" said Zhong. 

""In July, the State Council, China's cabinet, said the country will adopt a more proactive policy to support the economy in response to uncertainty abroad. The risk of an economic downturn has diminished.""

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Japan July services PMI slows slightly in sign of subdued activity,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Activity in Japan's services sector cooled slightly in July from the previous month as new orders grew at a slower pace, a private survey showed on Friday, suggesting the economy may have lost some momentum at the start of the third quarter.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 51.3 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 51.4 in June, though it has remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 22nd consecutive month.
Slower growth in new business and outstanding business suggests somewhat subdued activity, which was backed by a separate survey earlier this week on Japanese manufacturing activity. 
That showed factory activity grew less than initially reported last month, and there were lingering concerns about the economy due to the reduced pace at which new orders increased.
""Business activity has risen in successive months for almost two years, although the latest reading on the headline figure points to a relatively weak rate of expansion,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 51.8 from 52.1 in June.
Japan's economy is expected to have bounced back in the second quarter after a contraction in the first quarter, but a U.S.-driven international trade dispute is a risk to growth, economists say.
Japan's exports to the United States fell for the first time in 17 months and Japanese business sentiment soured amid worries about U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" protectionist trade policies.

The recent batch of data highlighted concerns that the export-reliant economy, the world's third biggest, could take a hit if Trump resorts to tariffs or other protectionist measures to fix trade imbalances with Japan.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>","Bank of England raises rates above crisis lows, signals no rush for next hike","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England pushed interest rates above their financial crisis lows on Thursday, but signaled it was in no hurry to raise them further as Britain heads for Brexit next year with no clear plan for leaving the European Union.
The BoE's nine rate-setters unexpectedly voted unanimously to raise rates to 0.75 from 0.50 percent, the level at which they have spent most of the past decade, apart from a period after the 2016 Brexit vote when they were cut even lower.
But sterling fell against the dollar and the euro and British government bond prices rose after BoE Governor Mark Carney stressed the gradual path for rate hikes ahead.
""Policy needs to walk -- not run -- to stand still,"" he said as he explained a new BoE estimate of neutral interest rates for Britain's economy, which the central bank believes will gradually rise against a backdrop of strong global growth.
Carney later told the BBC that one rate rise a year for the next few years was a good rule of thumb for the public, as long as there is no major Brexit shock for the economy.
Growth in Britain, the world's fifth-biggest economy, has slowed since the referendum decision in 2016 to leave the EU.
But the BoE pushed ahead with its rate hike because it believes the economy is operating almost at its ""speed limit"", or full capacity, raising the prospect of more home-grown inflation pressure ahead.
The increase in borrowing costs looks minimal compared with the average 5 percent rate before the financial crisis.
But business groups criticized the decision, which comes when there is so little clarity on Brexit. The British Chambers of Commerce called it ill-judged and the Institute of Directors said the BoE had ""jumped the gun"".
With less than eight months to go, London and Brussels -- as well as key members of the government -- remain far apart about the future Britain-EU trading relationship.
Carney played down fears the BoE would be forced into a U-turn on rates, saying the central bank was sticking to its assumption that there would be a smooth Brexit transition.
""The mistake is to always wait, wait, wait until you have perfect certainty,"" he said.
The BoE's backed up its message of gradual and limited rate increases with its forecasts for inflation only a fraction above its 2 percent target over the next few years.
The central bank said inflation in two years' time was most likely to be 2.09 percent.
The forecasts were based on bets by investors who expect another rate hike only in late 2019 or early 2020, with Bank Rate creeping up to 1.1 percent in late 2020. That is a fraction lower than a projection of rates of 1.2 percent the last time the BoE published forecasts for the economy in May.
""No one should get too excited about this being a sign of things to come,"" said Luke Bartholomew, an investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
""It is almost unthinkable that the Bank of England will follow up with further rate rises in the next few months given the risks on the horizon.""
However, markets now price in a greater than 50 percent chance that the BoE will raise rates again by May next year, shortly after Britain is due to leave the EU. 
The BoE forecast that Britain's economy would grow by 1.4 percent this year, unchanged from its view in May, but it nudged up its 2019 forecast to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent.
Wages were likely to be growing by an annual 2.5 percent at the end of this year, a bit slower than it thought in May, before rising to 3.25 percent by late 2019.
U-TURN RISK
Several analysts challenge the BoE's view that inflation pressures are building and say raising rates now only risks a U-turn by the central bank if Britain fails to get a Brexit deal.
Carney reiterated there could be ""consequences for monetary policy"" if Brexit led to a shock for Britain's economy.
Some investors think the risk of a global trade war is another reason for caution.
The BoE said it saw ""tentative signs that actual and prospective protectionist policies were starting to have an adverse impact"" on global trade.
It also fleshed out its thinking on how far it is likely to go with its planned rate hikes by publishing a new long-term forecast for what it called Britain's trend real interest rate, or ""R*"", of zero to 1 percent, more than 2 percentage points below its pre-financial crisis level.
Adjusted for the BoE's inflation target, this would imply Bank Rate of 2-3 percent to keep growth and inflation rates stable when the economy is running at full capacity.
In the shorter term, the Bank Rate implied by a so-called equilibrium real interest rate, or ""r*"", was likely to be somewhat lower, the BoE said, without giving a precise estimate.

Carney said the estimates should not be considered as a target for BoE policy but added r* was likely to rise slowly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market despite trade tensions.
Other data on Thursday showed new orders of U.S-made goods rose for a second straight month in June, but business spending on equipment appeared to be slowing further.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended July 28, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims dropped to 208,000 during the week ended July 14, which was the lowest reading since December 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week. 
""Claims had started to move higher in mid-June, leading us to question whether it could be the fallout of protectionist measures,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington. ""The decline over the past few weeks, however, suggests no such effect on labor markets yet.""
The United States is embroiled in tit-for-tat import tariffs with its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which have rattled the stock market.
The Trump administration has imposed duties on steel and aluminum imports, provoking retaliation by the trade partners. It has also slapped 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China. 
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump proposed a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Economists have warned that the tit-for-tat tariffs could disrupt the supply chain and weigh on manufacturing. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged while offering an upbeat assessment of both the labor market and economy. The U.S. central bank said ""the labor market has continued to strengthen and economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.""
Many economists expect the Fed will raise rates in September for a third time this year.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose while stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid the escalating trade tensions.
STRONG JOB GAINS EXPECTED
The Labor Department said the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,500 to 214,500 last week, the lowest reading since mid-May.
Last week's claims data has no bearing on July's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 190,000 jobs in July after increasing by 213,000 in June. 
The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.9 percent in July. Job growth averaged 215,000 per month in the first half of this year and the labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment.
""For now, the story still looks good for the labor market, for those looking for work, and the prospects for the economy to continue to grow,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said factory goods orders increased 0.7 percent, boosted by strong demand for transportation equipment, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computers and electronic products.
Factory orders increased by an unrevised 0.4 percent in May.
But manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, could be slowing as worker shortages and import tariffs put pressure on the supply chain.
An Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturers published on Wednesday showed a decline in production in July, with nearly all industries saying workers were scarce and that raw material prices had gone up because of tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imported products.
The Commerce Department also said June orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, rose 0.2 percent instead of increasing 0.6 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods climbed 0.7 percent in May.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.7 percent in June instead of surging 1.0 percent as reported last month. 

Core capital goods shipments edged up 0.1 percent in May. Business spending on equipment slowed in the second quarter.

The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ended July 28 increased by 1,000 to 218,000, up from the previous week’s 217,000, the U.S. Department of Labor said.
Analysts had expected claims to rise to 220,000 last week.
Figures for the prior week went unrevised at 217,000.
The four-week moving average fell by 3,500 to 214,500 last week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims, which measures the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, came in at 1,724,000 in the previous week. Continuing claims are reported with a one week lag.
That compared to a consensus forecast of 1,750,000.

1311,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Bank of England Raises Rates despite Mounting Brexit Worries,"Investing.com - The Bank of England raised interest rates Thursday, in what was widely anticipated decision, despite deepening worries over Brexit and indicated that any more hikes will be at a gradual pace.
The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75%. It the highest level since March 2009.
The BoE noted that “any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.”
The bank said it raised interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown at the start of the year and noted that despite still slow growth in the UK economy inflation is rising at a faster pace than its targeted rate.
The annual rate of inflation is currently running at 2.4%, slightly above the BoE’s target of 2% after falling back from its peak of 3.1% in November.
Recent data has indicated that the UK economy is showing signs of recovery after growth slowed to near stagnation at the start of the year, while the labor market remains resilient, even though wage growth is moderate.
The decision comes at a time of growing concerns over a lack of clarity on the terms under which the UK will exit the European Union in March of next year.
The BoE warned that Brexit could damage the economic recovery.
""The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal,"" the rate statement said.
It was only the second rate hike in a decade after the BoE last raised interest rates in November, reversing a rate cut imposed after the Brexit vote in 2016.
Sterling pared back losses after the decision, with GBP/USD at 1.3098 by 07:16 AM ET (11:16 AM GMT), off an earlier low of 1.3076, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8867, from around 0.8888 ahead of the announcement."

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.4 percent month-on-month in June against market expectations of a 0.3 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
Year-on-year, producer prices rose 3.6 percent in June, against market expectations of a 3.5 percent gain.
Energy prices rose 1.1 percent on the month and were 9.5 percent higher than a year earlier, making energy the biggest variable in the overall index. 
Without the volatile energy, producer prices rose only 0.2 percent month-on-month and 1.6 percent year-on-year.
Prices at factory gates herald trends in consumer inflation because unless absorbed by intermediaries or retailers, higher producer costs translate directly into higher consumer prices.

The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term. An early Eurostat estimate showed on Wednesday that in July, consumer inflation was 2.1 percent year-on-year.

Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index rose to 55.8 in July. That was its highest level since May 2017.
Analysts had expected the reading to drop to 52.8, from June's reading of 53.1.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted the robust and accelerated rise in construction activity and noted that house building expanded at its sharpest pace since December 2015.
The report also showed that rates of new order growth and job creation gained momentum.
“July data reveal an impressive turnaround in the performance of the UK construction sector, with output growth the strongest for just over one year,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
“While the recent rebound in construction work has been flattered by its recovery from a low base earlier in 2018, there are also signs that underlying demand conditions have picked up this summer,” he added."

Spain shed millions of jobs during a five-year economic downturn that began in 2008 after a property bubble burst.
Unemployment peaked at close to 27 percent in the first quarter of 2013. Since then some 2.9 million jobs have been created, equivalent to 86.5 percent of those lost during the downturn, the Labor Ministry data showed.
Some 19.14 million employees paid into the social security system last month, up 0.19 percent from June.
The number registering as jobless fell by 0.86 percent to 3.14 million, while in seasonally adjusted terms, 12,183 fewer people registered as unemployed, the ministry said.
Unemployment fell in all major sectors, with services accounting for the most marked drop due to the onset of the busy summer tourist season.
The quarterly unemployment rate based on a survey rather than registrations fell to 15.3 percent in the second quarter, the lowest level since the end of 2008, Spain's statistics institute said last week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in July amid signs that a robust economy and import tariffs were putting pressure on the supply chain, which could hurt production in the long term.
Other data on Wednesday showed private employers stepped up hiring in July, suggesting strength in the labor market and the overall economy at the start of the third quarter. The economy's vibrancy was acknowledged by the Federal Reserve, which described activity as ""rising at a strong rate."" 
But analysts expect the economic momentum to slow because of capacity constraints at factories and cooling global demand. 
""The rest of the year will be more challenging,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Businesses are already having a tough time with tight labor markets and finding qualified workers and they have to deal with higher costs and slowing demand from overseas.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.1 last month from 60.2 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The ISM described demand as remaining robust and noted ""employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle."" It also said manufacturers were ""overwhelmingly concerned about how tariff-related activity, including reciprocal tariffs, will continue to affect their business.""
President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy has embroiled the United States in tit-for-tat tariffs with major trade partners including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which Trump says are taking advantage of the United States.
Analysts have warned that import duties could disrupt supply chains, undercut business investment and put a brake on strong economic growth. While the ISM's supplier deliveries sub-index dropped 6.1 points to 62.1 last month, the reading remained high after racing to a 14-year peak in June.
Economists say trade tensions and the robust economy, marked by labor shortages and strong domestic demand, are behind delivery delays.
From food to machinery and primary metals industries, manufacturers said workers were scarce. Machinery manufacturers said many were falling behind schedule because of capacity constraints. Nearly all industries complained that operations were being hit by tariffs, which some said had raised prices for raw materials, including steel and aluminum. 
Manufacturers of electrical equipment, appliances and components said price increases ""are real and will affect costs beginning in the third quarter of 2018."" Others reported stocking up before the duties came into effect, leading to an inventory buildup. 
Transportation equipment manufacturers said higher raw material prices caused by the import duties would be passed on to domestic customers. Though the ISM survey's prices paid index fell in July, it remained high. Seventeen of the 18 industries reported paying more for raw materials in the last month.
The dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies (DXY) after the Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected. Prices for U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) fell. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. (N)
The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in June for the second time this year and has forecast two more rate hikes by the end of 2018.
ORDERS DECLINE
Factories reported a decline in both new and export orders in July. Order backlogs also fell last month, but manufacturers hired more workers. Production dropped sharply.
""With ... concerns rising over the impact of tariffs, which could weigh on exports and push up input prices, we suspect that the ISM index will continue to weaken gradually through the second half of this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years and double the 2.2 percent pace logged in the January-March period. 
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in July after rising by 181,000 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that private payrolls would increase by 185,000 last month.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics. While it is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the government's more comprehensive employment report, the report nonetheless supported expectations for solid job gains in July.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 190,000 in July after advancing by 213,000 positions in June.
The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.9 percent in July. Job growth averaged 215,000 per month in the first half of this year.

A third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed construction spending recorded its biggest drop in more than a year in June as investment in both private and public projects fell, but spending for the prior months was revised sharply higher.

The Fed kept the federal funds rate, which helps determine rates for mortgages and other borrowing, unchanged in a range of 1.75% to 2% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.
The FOMC said it continues to expect that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with ""sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2% objective over the medium term."" That reaffirmed investor expectations that the central bank remained on track to hike rates twice more this year.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, about 90% of traders expect the Fed to hike rates in September and more than 60% expect an additional rate hike in December.
Ahead of the Fed announcement, market participants were cautious of any change in the Fed's language concerning monetary policy, but the central bank stuck largely to script, reassuring investors that it would stay the course on rate hikes.
""The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation,"" the Fed said in its statement.
The Fed hiked rates by a quarter point in June and signaled it was inclined to four rate hikes this year, up from three previously. The U.S. central bank has raised rates seven times since December 2015.
The Fed's decision to stand pat on rates comes as recent data showed inflation remained close to target and the economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years boosted by consumer spending.
Meanwhile, a report on Tuesday showed that the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy prices, was up 0.1% and 1.9% on a year-over-year basis. The Fed targets inflation of 2%.
The Fed expects inflation higher than its 2% target over the next two years, according to its latest projections.
The report drew a muted reaction in markets as the unchanged decision from the Fed was largely expected.
The stock market took the Fed statement in stride, with the S&P 500 index falling slightly just after the statement and then bouncing back."

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factory growth stuttered across the world in July, heightening concerns about the global economic outlook as an intensifying trade conflict between the United States and China sent shudders through trading partners.
Global economic activity remains solid, but it has already passed its peak, according to economists polled by Reuters last month. They expect protectionist policies on trade - which show no signs of abating - to tap the brakes. [ECILT/WRAP]
But slowing growth, wilting confidence, and trade war fears are not likely to deter major central banks moving away from their ultra-loose monetary policies put in place during the last financial crisis.
""Growth overall is still there, and while there are risks, it's holding up. The big picture of a trade war and protectionism is that it is a slow death - a death by a thousand paper cuts instead of anything sudden and shocking,"" said Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at TD Securities.
""Growth is still resilient, unemployment rates are low, inflation and wages are rising - that's the bigger picture and so they (central banks) have to keep tightening in the face of that,"" he said. 
Last month, China and the United States imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods and another round of tariffs on $16 billion is expected in August. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, according to a source familiar with its plans, is poised to propose 25 percent tariffs on a further $200 billion of imports, up from an initial proposal of 10 percent. Its threat of tariffs on the entire $500 billion or so worth of goods imported from China still stands.
Beijing has pledged equal retaliation, although it only imports about $130 billion of U.S. goods.

China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.8 from June's 51.0, broadly in line with an official survey on Tuesday.
The headline number remained above the 50-point mark for the 14th consecutive month, but a reading on new export orders showed a marked contraction at 48.4.
""The data breakdown indicates that an uncertain demand outlook amidst the U.S.-China trade tariffs weighed on both output and sentiment,"" said Aakanksha Bhat, Asia economist at HSBC in Hong Kong.
Similar surveys revealed slowing activity from Australia to Japan. PMIs also showed a contraction in Malaysia, a slowdown in Vietnam and Taiwan, and only a modest pick-up in Indonesia. South Korea's exports showed slower-than-expected growth.
Growth in India's manufacturing industry also slowed last month, according to a survey released showed just before the Reserve Bank of India raised interest rates.
The shipping container market, in which the vast majority of finished manufacturing goods are imported and exported, shows a similar gloomy picture: the Harpex container index  has fallen by 10 percent from the highest levels since 2011 that it hit in June.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday raised interest rates for the second straight meeting, but retained its ""neutral"" stance as it aimed to contain inflation while not choking growth.
The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised the repo rate  by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent. It is the first time since October 2013 that the rate has been increased at consecutive policy meetings.
In June, the MPC also increased the key rate by 25 bps. 
The rate action was in line with a Reuters poll last week, which showed 37 of 63 economists expecting a rate increase.
""Rising trade protectionism poses a grave risk to near-term and long-term global growth prospects by adversely impacting investment, disrupting global supply chains and hampering productivity,"" the MPC warned in its policy statement.

Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to 54.0, from a downwardly revised 54.3 in the previous month and below forecasts for a reading of 54.2.
The report indicated that the recent soft patch in UK manufacturing continued at the start of the third quarter, which could give the Bank of England some pause over its decision to raise interest rates.
The rate of expansion in both output and new orders slowed in July, as weaker growth of new work from domestic sources offset a stronger increase in new export orders.
Price pressures also remained elevated as a strong increase in average input costs led to the steepest rise in selling prices since February
Employment rose for the twenty-fourth month in a row during July, with job creation sustained across the sector.
The report also said the degree of positive sentiment among companies dipped to a 21-month low in July, amid reports of uncertainty regarding both Brexit and the exchange rate.
“UK manufacturing started the third quarter on a softer footing, with rates of expansion in output and new orders losing steam. The upturn in the sector has eased noticeably since the back-end of 2017, meaning that manufacturing has failed to provide any meaningful boost to headline GDP growth through the year-so-far,"" said Rob Dobson, director at survey compiler Markit.
“If the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England’s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing growth remained subdued in July as worries about trade tensions, tariffs and rising prices kept optimism in check, a survey showed on Wednesday.
IHS Markit's July final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index only nudged up to 55.1 from June's 18-month low of 54.9, unchanged from an initial reading and still comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
The output index made a similar small move, rising to 54.4 from June's 54.2, which was its lowest reading since November 2016.
""A marginal uptick in the PMI provides little cause for cheer given it is the second weakest number for more than one-and-a-half years. Worse may be to come,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The clear implication is that manufacturers may have to adjust production down in coming months unless demand revives.""
But a new orders PMI matched June's 22-month low in July, the survey showed, which kept a lid on optimism. The future output index was 62.4, up from June's 60.7 but one of its lowest readings in two years.
Demand may also have been hit by rising prices. Inflation across the bloc was 2.1 percent last month, above the European Central Bank's target of just below 2 percent, official preliminary figures showed on Tuesday.
Last week, the ECB reaffirmed plans to end its 2.6 trillion euro stimulus program this year and keep rates at their record low level ""through the summer of 2019"".
""The survey responses indicate that the slowdown likely reflects worries about trade wars, tariffs and rising prices, as well as general uncertainty about the economic outlook,"" Williamson said.

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing, which accounts for about 10 percent of the Greek economy, was unchanged in July at 53.5, above the 50 line denoting expansions in activity. The manufacturing sector has improved steadily since June 2017.
""Growth remained strong in July. Rates of expansion in output and new orders eased, partly reflecting a weaker expansion in new export orders,"" said Andrew Harker, IHS Markit associate director.
Driving the 14th straight month of growth in output were increased new orders at home and from abroad. Export business grew but at a softer pace than June.
With raw materials prices continuing to rise at a fast pace at the start of the third quarter, some firms were able to pass their higher cost burdens on to customers.
""Input costs continued to rise at a sharp pace, posing a potential threat to new order growth going forward,"" Harker said. ""Nevertheless, a sharp and accelerated rise in average charges suggests client demand for Greek goods remains robust.""
Manufacturing jobs continued to increase in July, extending a trend seen since May last year, with many firms maintaining a fairly upbeat outlook on production growth in the coming year, the survey showed.
Greece's jobless rate, at 20.2 percent in April, is the highest in the euro zone. A debt crisis in late 2009 led to a long recession and multiple bailouts. Athens plans to exit its third rescue program in August.

Yet the index has now held above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for 12 straight months, indicating the economy was on a reasonably solid footing and could retain the title of fastest growing major economy in the coming quarters. 
""The recent improvement in Indian manufacturing conditions lost some impetus in July, with softer rises in output, new orders and employment all recorded,"" Aashna Dodhia, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
""However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the sector continued on a steady expansionary path, as production and new business rose at marked rates.""
Foreign demand expanded at a slightly slow pace, though July marked the ninth consecutive month of growth despite a U.S.-driven international trade war that is expected to tap the brakes on global growth. [ECILT/WRAP]
Indeed, some respondents remained doubtful over the economy's growth prospects.
""IHS Markit recently downgraded its forecast of real GDP growth to 7.1 percent in (FY) 2018, reflecting rising headwinds to expansion, including high oil prices, large capital outflows from emerging markets, and tighter domestic monetary policy,"" said Dodhia.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) declined to 50.8 in July from June's 51.0, matching economists' forecast and a November 2017 level. 
While it remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 14th consecutive month, the sub-indexes for output and new orders showed slower growth last month. 
That led companies to continue to reduce staff levels, though a decline in inventory was a potentially positive sign.
More worrisome for manufacturers was a reading on new export orders which showed a marked contraction at 48.4 - the fourth consecutive month of shrinking orders and the worst slump since June 2016.
The weak trend for export orders comes as both China and the United States remained locked in a bitter trade dispute. On July 6, both nations slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods amid an escalating brawl that many investors and policy makers fear could harm investments and businesses in a hit to global growth. 
""In general, the survey signaled a weakening manufacturing trend as a grim export market dragged on the sector's performance. The positive drivers were the increase in stocks of purchases and easing pressure on capital turnover,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the survey.
The Caixin survey results were broadly in line with an official PMI released on Tuesday showing slower factory growth in July, with the manufacturing index slipping to 51.2, from June's 51.5. 
China's June exports growth cooled only slightly from the previous month, and so far there have been few signs of a broad impact from the tariffs on factories, with companies saying a weaker yuan was helping to cushion the impact of duties. 
A raft of data for June showed momentum has already started to slacken in the world's second-biggest economy. The risk to the outlook from the escalating trade frictions has prompted Beijing to switch to a more accommodative fiscal policy in a bid to boost growth in the second half of the year. 
On the cost front, price pressures faded some in July, the survey showed. Both input price and output price gains slowed, with some firms commenting that relatively subdued demand restricted pricing power. Input prices rose significantly faster than output prices, according to the survey, indicating margins of some downstream firms could be getting squeezed.

SEOUL, August 1 (Reuters) - South Korea's exports returned to growth in July on brisk sales of memory chips, but the chill from a deepening U.S.-China trade conflict had still to be felt, and there were also doubts over how much longer booming demand for chips would last.
Exports increased 6.2 percent from a year earlier to $51.9 billion, marking a rebound after slipping 0.2 percent in June, government data showed on Wednesday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7 percent growth. 
Imports surged to $44.9 billion, up 16.2 percent from a year ago, slightly below 16.6 percent seen in the survey. 
Solid overseas sales of South Korean goods indicate the trade tension between the United States and China have not yet dealt a serious blow to South Korean economy, though tougher times are expected. 
Economists worry that the trade war may crimp South Korea's exports to China, its biggest trading partner and major buyer of South Korean intermediate goods. 
""The U.S.-China trade conflict will put downward pressure, and exports could dwindle,"" said Kim Yu-mi, an economist at Kiwoom Securities. 
Some analysts also foresee an imminent end to the two-year global chip boom, which had fueled the strong export growth in the past year.
An early warning sign flickered with the 6.6 percent drop in facility investment in the second quarter, which the Bank of Korea attributed to ""weaker investment for memory chips and display panels.""

Manufacturing activity was hit by output and new orders shrinking to 3-month lows, at 47.8 and 47.3, respectively. Reflecting the grim conditions, business confidence also plunged to ten-month low, the survey showed. The output reading reflects significant weakness seen in the June production data.
""Firms have not signaled higher output since February, while anecdotal evidence continues to point to weak demand pressures originating specifically from the domestic economy,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at HIS Markit. 
The weakness in domestic demand comes at a time of heightened global growth worries as a U.S.-driven international trade war threatens to hurt major export-reliant economies.
A sub-index for new export orders fell 50.1 last month from 52.9 in June, signaling only a marginal rise in new business from abroad - a trend if continued could significantly hurt economic growth. 
Like some other major economies, South Korea risks getting caught in the crossfire of a heated trade row between the United States and China - its biggest export market. That has added to the uncertainty for its globe-trotting manufacturers. 

Panelists said they reduced output due to fewer incoming new workloads, undermined by stiff competition. Higher oil price, and a stronger U.S. dollar also raised their input costs, the survey showed.

The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 23rd consecutive month.
""Latest survey data signaled a slowdown to manufacturing sector growth at the beginning of Q3,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Output growth eased and there was a noticeable softening of demand, while export sales failed to record any upswing for a second month running.""
The final index for new orders was 50.9, the lowest since October 2016. The July flash reading was 50.1 and the final one for June was 52.7.
The index for new export orders was 50.0, compared with the preliminary 49.7 and above a final 48.9 in June.
Washington is engaged in a heated dispute with China over Beijing's trade surplus with the United States, and there are worries President Donald Trump's administration could ask Japan to take concrete steps to lower its trade surplus as well.

Overall prices paid by shoppers were 0.3 percent lower last month than in July 2017, down from a 0.5 percent fall in June and the smallest annual decline since December, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.
Food prices rose by an annual 1.6 percent in July, up from 1.2 percent in June and May.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 12:26PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending rises; wage growth slows in second-quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in June as households spent more at restaurants and on accommodation, building a strong base for the economy heading into the third quarter, while inflation rose moderately.
Other data on Tuesday showed employers boosting benefits for workers in the second quarter, but wage growth slowed down. With savings at lofty levels and lower taxes increasing take-home pay for some workers, spending is likely to remain strong this year. Accelerating home prices, which are boosting wealth for some households, should also underpin consumption.
Strong economic growth and steadily rising inflation are likely to allow the Federal Reserve to continue gradually raising interest rates. Fed officials started a two-day meeting on Tuesday. 
""More spending on 'wants,' not 'needs,' is always a good sign of consumer confidence,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""As long as incomes continue to rise and job creation remains strong, consumer spending should remain solid over the remainder of the year.""
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4 percent last month. Data for May was revised up to show consumer spending advancing 0.5 percent instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent gain.
Last month's increase in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations. The data was included in last Friday's second-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending accelerating at a 4.0 percent annualized rate during that period after a pedestrian 0.5 percent pace in the first quarter.
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent rate in the second quarter, almost double the January-March period's 2.2 percent pace and the strongest performance in nearly four years. June's increase in consumer spending sets it on a higher growth path heading into the third quarter. 
Consumer spending last month was boosted by spending at restaurants and on accommodation. Spending on services accelerated 0.6 percent after rising 0.3 percent in May. Outlays on goods were unchanged after surging 0.9 percent in May. 
Prices continued to steadily rise last month. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components gained 0.1 percent in June. It had risen by 0.2 percent in the prior month. 
That kept the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 1.9 percent for a third straight month. 
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. The core PCE hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since December 2011. 
The Fed is expected leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday after increasing borrowing costs in June for the second time this year. It has forecast two more rate hikes by December.
""For the Fed, there's nothing to be alarmed about in this morning's data,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""Consumers are behaving and inflation is stable.""
The dollar firmed marginally against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose and stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
LONG WAGE RECOVERY
Spending in June was supported by a 0.4 percent increase in personal income, which matched May's increase. Savings edged up to $1.050 trillion last month from $1.047 trillion in May.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.6 percent after an unrevised 0.8 percent advance in the first quarter. That pushed the annual increase in the ECI to 2.8 percent, the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2008, from 2.7 percent in the first quarter.
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.5 percent in the second quarter, retreating from a 0.9 percent surge in the January-March period. Wages and salaries were up 2.8 percent in the 12 months through June, also the biggest annual gain since the third quarter of 2008.
""The long recovery in wages has reflected a large pool of workers on the sidelines,"" said Adam Ozimek, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""One factor leaning against a return to rapid wage growth is weaker productivity.""
Separately, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 0.3 point to a reading of 127.4 in July. Consumers were upbeat about the labor market.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, increased to 28.1 this month from 25.3 in June. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and is consistent with rapidly diminishing labor market slack.
Despite their strong confidence in the economy, consumers appeared less enthusiastic about buying a home and household appliances. Still, the fundamentals for consumer spending remain strong. 

A fourth report on Tuesday showed the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite price index rose 6.5 percent year-on-year in May after increasing 6.7 percent in April.

Mays’s reading was revised up down to 127.1 from the initial 126.4.
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.

Franco indicated that the relatively unchanged reading of current conditions suggests that the level of economic growth remains strong.
""However, while expectations continue to reflect optimism in the short-term economic outlook, back-to-back declines suggest consumers do not foresee growth accelerating,"" she added."

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 06:27AM ET</span>","Trade worries slow euro zone economic growth in second-quarter, inflation up on energy","By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth slowed further in the second quarter, preliminary data showed, on what economists said were concerns over a possible trade war with the United States.
Separately, price growth accelerated due to higher energy prices, European Union statistics office Eurostat reported, although economists cautioned the uptick was unlikely to affect policy for now as energy effects are temporary.
Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise.
""Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2,"" Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank said in a note to clients.
""While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important,"" he said.
""With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favorable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down,"" he said.
The euro zone's second biggest economy France appeared to have been struggling with its own specific problems in the second quarter, as strikes and higher taxes hit consumer spending, but economists looked to the second half of the year for an upturn.
Eurostat estimated that headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy, which jumped to 9.4 percent year on year from 8.0. 
Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations.
An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July -- again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.
""This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB,"" Colijn said.
Economists said the higher inflation numbers would not trigger any policy tightening by the ECB yet.
""These numbers are unlikely to alter the view of the central bank,"" said Daniele Antonucci, economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""It has made clear that it is taking its time before changing its rates and balance sheet guidance again. While Quantitative Easing should finish at year-end, we only see the first depo rate hike of 15 basis points to -0.25 percent in October 2019. Reinvestments should continue for a long time, probably way past our 2019 forecast horizon,"" he said.

Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. The lowest unemployment rate in the euro zone was in Germany at 3.4 percent of the workforce, but it by less than expected in July, data showed, reflecting a cooling economy.

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said its consumer price index rose 2.1% in July from the same month a year earlier, compared to expectations for a reading of 2%.
Core, or underlying inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, picked up to an annual rate of 1.1% from 0.9% in the previous month.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong private home prices hit another record in June and climbed over 10 percent in 2018's first-half, government data showed, but analysts said potential interest rate hikes and trade disputes could crimp increases over the rest of the year.
Any cooling in prices would be good news for the government, which has repeatedly vowed to make housing more affordable in a city often cited as the least affordable in the world.
Property prices rose 1.6 percent in June from May to break record levels for the 20th month in a row, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department released on Tuesday. June prices were up 15.9 percent compared with a year earlier.
A 650-square-foot flat on Hong Kong Island would cost nearly HK$11.5 million ($1.47 million), according to calculations using June data from property agency Midland Realty.
But after a 27-month-long run of rising monthly prices, the longest such period in Hong Kong's history, analysts expect the red-hot market to ease over the rest of the year. 
""The asking prices of some new projects are now less aggressive - a sign that developers are keen to boost sales,"" Cliff Tse, regional director of valuation advisory services at property consultancy JLL, said on Friday.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 10:50PM ET</span>",Australian home investors in full retreat as prices fall,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Growth in Australian home loans for investment hit record lows in June as tighter lending standards and hikes in some mortgage rates sucked the life out of the buy-to-let sector, piling further pressure on house prices.
Tuesday's figures showed the stock of outstanding credit for home investment fell 0.1 percent in June, from May. That was the first drop since the global financial crisis and only the third decline in the near-30 year history of the series.
Annual growth in investor credit slowed to an all-time low of 1.6 percent, a long way from the 10 percent-plus seen at the peak of the housing boom in 2015.
That dragged growth in overall housing credit down to a four-year trough of 5.6 percent, leaving loans totaling A$1.77 trillion ($1.31 trillion).
Much of this cooling has been intentional as regulators clamped down on risky lending to head off a housing bubble that might ultimately hurt consumers and the economy in general.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has so far been content with the results, though it has recently sounded more concerned about the impact of falling home prices given the country's dangerous levels of household debt.
An added wrinkle has been an increase in funding costs for banks over the last few months which had put upward pressure on mortgage rates.
In a recent report, Moody's Investors Service noted that 16 small and midsize banks had raised their home loan rates in the face of higher wholesale costs and slower loan growth.
The four major banks had held off so far, in part due to intense public scrutiny amid a government inquiry which had turned up evidence of widespread misdeeds in the industry.
Moody's suspected that might not last.
""The rate hikes by the smaller banks may be paving the way for the major banks to raise their rates and preserve margins, despite the politically charged environment,"" the agency said.
While such a move would be positive for bank profits and their credit quality, it would come at a tough time for the once red-hot markets of Sydney and Melbourne.
The latest data from property consultant CoreLogic showed prices for the combined capital cities were heading for their tenth straight month of decline in July.
Sydney has led the retreat with values down 5.4 percent on a year ago, while prices in Melbourne eased 0.4 percent. That was the first time both cities had turned negative since the 2008 global financial crisis.
The softness in home lending and prices has in turn clouded the outlook for construction activity, though the damage has been limited by rapid population growth.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed approvals to build new homes bounced 6.4 percent in June, well above forecasts of a flat outcome.
Overall, approvals were still running around an historically high rate of 230,000 a year, countering concerns of a major downturn in construction anytime soon.

One polling firm said the lack of clarity about leaving the European Union in March next year was likely to be a drag on consumer confidence in the months ahead.
Britain's headline gauge of consumer confidence, compiled by market research firm GfK for the European Commission, edged down -10 in July from -9 in June, a touch weaker than expected by economists who took part in a Reuters poll.
Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director, said consumers appeared to be particularly susceptible to bad news against the backdrop of the uncertainty about Brexit.
""In the medium term, and during the uncertainty in the run-up to the UK leaving the European Union in eight months, it is hard to forecast what kind of good news will change the numbers from negative to positive,"" Staton said 
A separate measure of consumer confidence produced by YouGov for the Centre for Economics and Business Research showed a marginal rise in July but still down notably from before the Brexit vote.
Among companies, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank's business confidence barometer remained unchanged at 29 percent, much weaker than levels of around 40 and 50 percent before the Brexit referendum.

Brexit remains a concern, Hawes said, as the organization repeated its call for negotiators to back“free and frictionless trade,” according to a statement Tuesday. If Britain were to leave the EU without a trade deal, the U.K. auto industry would suffer “death by a thousand cuts” as eroding competitiveness makes it harder for companies to justify future investment in the country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly rose in June after two straight monthly declines, but the housing market remains hobbled by a dearth of properties available for sale.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 0.9 percent to a reading of 106.9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales unchanged in June.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's surprise rise suggested a rebound in existing home sales, which have declined for three straight months. But any bounce back in home sales is likely to limited by a chronic shortage of homes, which is keeping house prices elevated.
Pending home sales fell 2.5 percent in June from a year ago. Housing data has softened in recent months. Housing starts and building permits dropped to a nine-month low in June amid more expensive building materials and shortages of land and labor. New home sales tumbled to an eight-month low in June.
""The trends in many housing indicators have weakened lately and we think that the recent increase in rates is putting some downward pressure on activity in the housing market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
House price increases are above 5 percent on an annual basis, far outpacing wage growth, which has been stuck below 3 percent, despite a robust labor market. The 30-year mortgage rate is around 4.54 percent, but still low by historical standards.
Though the weakness in housing has been mostly driven by supply constraints, there are worries that it could spill over to the broader economy, through a reduction in purchases of household items like appliances and furniture.
Investment in homebuilding contracted in the second quarter. It was the second straight quarterly decline. The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period, the strongest performance in nearly four years.
In June, home purchase contracts increased 1.1 percent in the populous South. They gained 0.7 percent in the West, which has seen faster house price inflation, and jumped 1.4 percent in the Northeast. Contracts rose 0.5 percent in the Midwest.
""Even with slightly more homeowners putting their home on the market, inventory is still subpar and not meeting demand,"" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. ""As a result, affordability constraints are pricing out some would-be buyers and keeping overall sales activity below last year's pace."" 

The Realtors group expects existing home sales to decrease 1.0 percent this year, reversing 2017's 1.1 percent increase.

BERLIN/MADRID (Reuters) - German and Spanish inflation remained slightly above the European Central Bank's price stability target in July, preliminary data showed on Monday, supporting the ECB's cautious approach of winding down its monetary stimulus only gradually.
With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB plans to wrap up its lavish bond purchases by the end of the year. But it also said last week that interest rates would remain at record lows through the summer of 2019.
German consumer price inflation, harmonized to make it comparable with data from other European Union countries, remained at 2.1 percent year-on-year, the Federal Statistics Office said. This was in line with a Reuters poll of analysts and above the ECB target of close to but below 2 percent.
On the month, EU-harmonized prices were up 0.4 percent, the preliminary numbers showed. The price increase was mainly driven by higher energy costs while food inflation slowed compared to the previous month, a breakdown of the figures showed.
The statistics office did not provide a flash figure for core inflation but Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said that German inflation excluding the highly volatile energy and food components remained unchanged at 1.4 percent.
Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW bank, said that the inflation rate in Europe's biggest economy would probably ease in the coming months due to falling energy prices.
""After all, crude oil prices, as their recent main driver, are currently tending to weaken again,"" he added.
In Spain, Europe's fourth-biggest economy, EU-harmonized consumer price inflation remained unchanged at 2.3 percent year-on-year in July, flash data from the National Statistics Institute in Madrid showed on Monday.

The euro zone will publish preliminary July inflation data on Tuesday, with the annual rate expected to remain unchanged at 2.0 percent, according to a Reuters poll. The ECB's target is close to but just under 2.0 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's housing market is perking up and consumer confidence has neared a two-year high, according to figures on Monday that probably keep the Bank of England on track to raise interest rates this week.
The data from the BoE and European Commission are likely to bolster the central bank's view that Britain's economy, while growing only slowly, has recovered from an early 2018 slowdown caused by an unusually cold winter.
Britain has lagged behind most other rich economies since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union. But the BoE has said it needs to raise rates because even Britain's slow growth is likely to generate too much inflation.
The BoE said British lenders approved 65,619 mortgages in June, a five-month high and up from 64,684 in May. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 65,500. There was also a bigger-than-expected increase in lending to consumers.
Separately, a European Commission survey on Monday indicated that British consumer confidence rose to its highest level since September 2016, shortly after the Brexit referendum. 
""The further pick-up in households' and corporates' borrowing in June strengthens the case for the (BoE) to raise interest rates at its meeting on Thursday, though we doubt that the recovery has further to run,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Previously published surveys have shown a downbeat outlook for the housing market and subdued lending plans from major British banks, he said. 
Most economists polled by Reuters think the BoE will raise rates to a new post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent on Thursday. [BOE/INT]
However, some economists are concerned that domestically generated inflation pressure - mostly from wage growth - is actually weakening, which would make a rate hike unnecessary and even damaging to households.
""Mindful of the global and domestic macro and political backdrop - namely ongoing UK government instability - I continue to believe that a prospective rate hike is an unnecessary risk,"" Sajiv Vaid, a portfolio manager with Fidelity, said. 
Monday's BoE figures showed net mortgage lending rose by 3.851 billion pounds ($5.05 billion), while consumer lending increased by 1.567 billion pounds compared with a forecast rise of 1.3 billion pounds.
Consumer credit growth has been slowing gradually since it peaked at nearly 11 percent in January 2016. 

The BoE has played down any suggestion of a debt bubble, though it has acknowledged pockets of risk and required banks to set aside more money against the risk of bad loans.

The Commission survey showed the economic sentiment indictor for the 19 countries sharing the euro currency eased to 112.1 points in July form 112.3 in June, continuing a downward trend started since a peak of 115.2 last December.
Separately, the Commission's business climate indictor, which helps identify the phase of the business cycle, fell to 1.29 in July from 1.38 in June, following a similar downward path as economic sentiment since a peak of 1.63 in January.
The easing of sentiment in July was mainly due to a fall in the indicator for industry which decreased to 5.8 from 6.9, because managers were more pessimistic on production expectations, the current level of overall order books and stocks of finished products. 
The survey suggested trade tensions between the European Union and the United States, that resulted in the U.S. imposing tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports in June as well as the threat of more tariffs on EU cars, had an effect.
""Managers' assessment of past production improved while their views on export order books worsened,"" the survey said.
Sentiment in services, which generate more than two thirds of euro zone gross domestic product, improved to 15.3 from 14.4 in June, while consumer sentiment held stable at -0.6 points -- still high above the long-term average of -12.2.
The mood in the retail sector fell sharply to -0.1 from 0.7 as managers worried over the expected business situation and the adequacy of the volume of stocks. 

Consumer inflation expectations over the next 12 months rose to 18.0, close to the long-term average of 18.6. Selling price expectations in industry fell to 9.7 in July from 10.1 in June.

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Indonesia's inflation rate seen increasing slightly in July,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's annual inflation rate in July likely increased slightly due to higher food prices, though the pace remained inside the central bank's target range, a Reuters poll showed.
The consumer price index (CPI) is expected to have climbed 3.24 percent in July, according to the median forecast of 12 economists polled by Reuters, fractionally above June's 3.12 percent annual pace.
Maybank Indonesia's chief economist Juniman cited rising prices of chicken, eggs and beef as well as non-subsidized fuel as the main reasons for the increase.
Perry Warjiyo, Bank Indonesia (BI) governor, told reporters on Thursday that for all of 2018, the central bank expects the headline inflation rate to be around 3.5 percent, the midpoint of BI's 2.5-4.5 percent target range.
In the poll, July's annual core inflation rate, which excludes government-controlled and volatile food prices, was seen at 2.74 percent, just a touch above June's 2.72 percent pace.
BI, whose mandate is to control the rupiah's level through the inflation-targeting framework and management of its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, has raised its benchmark policy rate <IDCBRR=ECI> three times since mid-May, by a total of 100 basis points, to 5.25 percent.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",China factory growth seen cooling slightly in July,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's factory sector is expected to have slowed for a second month in July amid softer domestic investment and as the worsening trade dispute with the United States clouds the outlook for external demand.
The slowdown in July is expected to be slight, however, as healthy profit margins driven by strong commodities prices and efforts to limit excess production capacity mean firms are keen to keep their factories humming.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to fall to 51.3 in July from 51.5 in June, according to the median forecast of 28 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
That would mark two years of expansion for China's manufacturing sector, following a recovery in global demand for Chinese exports and strong credit growth, which has driven a housing boom.
However, both of these drivers have slowed this year, as export growth pulls back and the government reins in credit expansion in a bid to put the economy on a more sustainable growth path.
That has raised concerns that the slowdown in growth could be steeper than expected in the second half of the year, as exports to the United States, China's largest export market, face higher tariffs.
Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing rapidly deteriorated in July as the world's two largest economies formally slapped new tariffs on each other's goods with threats of more to come.
China's economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter, but this was still above the official 2018 growth target of around 6.5 percent.
The industrial sector so far has held up, with profits rising 20 percent in May on strong ex-factory price inflation.
But Beijing isn't sitting still and has stepped in with measures to support growth as a sharper slowdown could fuel job losses, a concern raised by a government official this week.
China is expected to boost spending on infrastructure projects over the rest of the year and ease borrowing curbs on local governments to support growth, Reuters reported Friday citing policy sources.
""This round of fiscal stimulus should be more contained compared to previous rounds given already high macro leverage and already high property prices,"" Lisheng Wang, economist at Nomura in Hong Kong.
Wang said he expects a more visible slowdown in China's economy in the third quarter before some policy-driven stabilization in the fourth quarter.
Separately, a private survey on China's factory expansion is forecast to hit an eight month low in July, though the slowdown is expected to be mild.
The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) is expected to have fallen to 50.8 in July versus 51.0 in June.
The official PMI survey is due out on Tuesday, along with a similar official survey on services.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Aug. 1, and the Caixin services PMI on Aug. 3.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 08:49PM ET</span>",Japan retail sales pick up in positive sign for spending,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales climbed more than expected in June due to increased spending on fuel, appliances and cosmetics, in a positive sign that households are growing more confident in the economy.
The 1.8-percent annual increase in retail sales in June was more than the median estimate for a 1.6-percent annual gain and follows a 0.6-percent annual increase in May.The results for June showed retail sales have risen for eight consecutive months.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales also gained 1.5 percent in June versus a 1.7-percent decline in the previous month, data from the trade ministry showed on Monday. 
Japan's economy is expected to bounce back in April-June from the first-quarter contraction that ended the longest growth run since the 1980s bubble economy.
However, the gain in retail sales is unlikely to provide much comfort for the Bank of Japan, which is struggling with low inflation and the side effects of its radical monetary easing program.
""Consumer spending is improving gradually, because the labor market is tight and people are getting their summer bonus payments,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""I'm still worried about spending because there are many part-time workers. Prices are not rising, so the BOJ will try to change its message about policy.""
The jobless rate is at a 25-year low of 2.2 percent, which many economists say should support consumer spending by putting upward pressure on wages.
There are risks that consumer sentiment could weaken if Japan becomes ensnared in a row with the United States over trade policy.
Washington is engaged in a heated dispute with China over its trade surplus, and there are worries U.S. President Donald Trump's administration could ask Japan to take concrete steps to lower its trade surplus as well.

The BOJ is likely to lower its inflation forecasts at a meeting ending Tuesday and could tweak its massive stimulus program to make its monetary policy more sustainable.

Key Takeaways
Retail sales have largely recovered from a weak first quarter, despite a sharp drop in May. Still, tepid wage gains mean Japanese shoppers remain reluctant to really ramp up spending. That leaves Japan’s economic recovery still reliant on exports at a time when the trade outlook looks increasingly cloudy, with the U.S. considering tariffs on car imports.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 02:16PM ET</span>",Trump hails growth as one-offs and consumers boost economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July.
President Donald Trump, who ahead of Friday's release of the gross domestic product report had promoted the notion that second-quarter growth would be robust, declared victory.
""We have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions,"" Trump told reporters. ""These numbers are very, very sustainable."" 
Gross domestic product increased at a 4.1 percent annualized rate also as government spending picked up, the Commerce Department said in its snapshot of second-quarter GDP. While that was the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014, it was not the best since the recession ended in mid-2009.
January-March quarter GDP growth was revised up to a 2.2 percent pace from the previously reported 2.0 percent rate to account for updated information and methodology improvements.
Compared to the second quarter of 2017, the economy grew 2.8 percent. Output expanded 3.1 percent in the first half of 2018, putting the economy on track to hit the Trump administration's target of 3 percent annual growth. A measure of domestic demand surged at a 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter. 
Contrary to Trump's assertions, the economy enjoyed periods of robust growth during the Obama administration. GDP growth recorded a 5.1 percent pace in the second quarter of 2014 and the economy experienced four quarters of output above a 4.0 percent rate.
Economists also cautioned against putting much weight on the surge in second-quarter growth as one-off factors, including a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, were behind the growth spurt. The soybean boost is likely to reverse in the coming quarters and the fiscal stimulus is seen fading in 2019. 
""Pop the champagne today, but don't get used to it, growth going forward has a lot of headwinds,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Unless you cut taxes again, there won't be additional tax cut monies to line company and consumer pocket books.""
The United States slapped 25 percent duties on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods effective July 6, provoking a similar response from Beijing, which targeted soybeans and other agricultural products as well as U.S.-made cars. 
Trump has also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, leading to retaliation by the United States' main trade partners, including Canada, the European Union, Mexico and China. 
Strong growth in the April-June quarter likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates two more times this year. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in June for the second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes for 2018.
The GDP report showed the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 2.0 percent rate in the second quarter. The core PCE price index rose at a 2.2 percent pace in the January-March period.
The dollar was little changed versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell and stocks on Wall Street were down.
GROWTH SEEN SLOWING 
While trade war fears helped to boost output last quarter, import duties are seen undercutting economic growth, with higher prices for goods discouraging consumer spending and businesses shelving investment plans. Economists in a Reuters poll earlier this week predicted that growth will slow notably from here.
""The spring quarter could be the high water mark for growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That said, there is every reason to expect that growth in the second half of the year will still be in the 3 percent range."" 
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 4.0 percent rate in the second quarter. That was the fastest in 3-1/2 years and followed the January-March period's stall-speed pace of 0.5 percent. 
Households bought motor vehicles and spent more on health care, utilities, food and accommodation in the last quarter. 
Consumer spending is also being driven by a robust labor market, which created an average of 215,000 jobs per month in the first half of this year.
The front-loading of deliveries of soybeans and other goods boosted exports in the second quarter, which grew at their quickest pace in 4-1/2 years, sharply narrowing the trade deficit. Trade added 1.06 percentage points GDP growth in the second quarter after being neutral in the January-March period.
The rush to offload soybeans, however, depleted farm inventories. Inventories declined at a $27.9 billion rate after rising at a $30.3 billion pace in the first quarter. They subtracted 1.0 percentage point from GDP growth.
Business spending on equipment slowed and a further moderation is likely, with trade wars casting a pall on the business spending outlook.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Wednesday cut their full-year profit forecasts, citing higher steel and aluminum costs. 
Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) has warned that more expensive steel and aluminum and a 25 percent retaliatory duty imposed by the European Union on shipments from the United States could cost the motorcycle maker $45 million to $55 million this year.

Investment in homebuilding fell for a second straight quarter. Government spending grew solidly, boosted by defense outlays.

The revised publication of the data for July from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment showed a reading of 97.9, up from the initial reading of 97.1.
Analysts had forecast for it to remain unchanged.
The current conditions indicator increased to 114.4 in July, from the previous reading of 113.9.
Economists had projected that the index would rise to just 114.0.
Additionally, consumer expectations unexpectedly increased to 87.3 in July, from the previous 86.4.
That beat consensus that had expected a rise to just 86.5.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months and the five-year gauge went unrevised at 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively..
The surveyor considered the 0.3 point decline in the headline number from June to be “trivial.”
“Despite the expectation of higher inflation and higher interest rates during the year ahead, consumers have kept their confidence at high levels due to favorable job and income prospects,” the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin explained.
Americans' worries over tariffs accelerated
However, this expert highlighted that concerns about tariffs greatly accelerated in the July survey.
“Across all households, 35% spontaneously mentioned that the tariffs would have a negative economic impact in July, up from 21% in June and 15% in May,” the data showed.
“Of course, these negative economic expectations could quickly disappear if the trade issues with Europe are promptly settled and immediately followed by agreements with China, Canada, and Mexico,” Curtin said.
“Resolution is critical to forestall decreases in consumer discretionary spending as a precaution against a worsening economy,” he concluded."
1364,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Second Quarter GDP Growth Accelerates to 4.1%,"Investing.com - U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter, matching forecasts and underlining the case for the Federal Reserve to proceed with plans to gradually increase interest rates.
In a report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said that GDP registered a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 4.1% growth in the three month period from April to June, nearly double the 2.2% expansion registered in the first quarter of 2018 and its fastest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2014.
The reading was in line with consensus.
The strong reading supports the upbeat assessment of the U.S economy that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivered to Congress in testimony last week, reaffirming expectations for two additional rate hikes this year.
“With a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Powell testified on July 17.
Some observers have expressed concerns that the strong rate of growth seen in the second quarter is unsustainable, especially given recent concerns over trade tensions between the U.S. and other parts of the world.
Powell admitted that “it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy,” but emphasized that he felt the risk of the economy unexpectedly weakening was roughly balanced with the possibility of the economy growing faster than the Fed anticipated.
“The longer the trade uncertainty continues, the more it is likely to weigh on business sentiment, which could translate into lower capex spending and a slowdown in employment hiring,” ING economists noted ahead of the release.
“However, we have to remember there is a lot of stimulus in the system to provide a cushion -- the $1.5 trillion of tax cuts and the $300 billion of extra government spending this year -- while the tax hike effects of the tariffs enacted so far are only measured in the tens of billions,” they explained."

Seasonally adjusted data from the Insolvency Service showed 28,951 people registered as insolvent between April and June -- up 27 percent on a year ago and the largest total since early 2012 when Britain last flirted with recession.
(For a graphic on 'UK personal insolvencies' click https://reut.rs/2JZ6D0D)
There are questions about the long-term financial health of British consumers who have been squeezed by high inflation caused by the pound's sharp fall after the 2016 Brexit vote.
On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics said households' outgoings surpassed their income last year for the first time since 1988, raising concerns about debt problems among many consumers.
Most economists polled by Reuters think the BoE will raise rates to a new post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent next Thursday. The central bank believes inflation pressure is beginning to firm and that a slowdown in the economy in early 2018 was caused mostly by cold winter weather.
But wage growth has failed to pick up much and some economists are concerned that domestically generated inflation pressure is actually weakening, which would mean a rate hike would be unnecessary and even detrimental to households.
""While the economy as a whole is holding up surprisingly well, the number of people already falling into insolvency -- or teetering on the edge of the abyss -- suggests an interest rate rise may drive many more to the wall,"" David Birne, insolvency partner at accountants HW Fisher, said.
Individual voluntary arrangements, a form of debt relief short of bankruptcy, accounted for most of the rise in people registering as insolvent in the second quarter, the Insolvency Service said.
In England and Wales, which accounts for the vast majority of Britain's population, 1 in 433 people registered as insolvent -- the highest rate in five years.

The Insolvency Service also said business insolvencies in England and Wales rose 12.6 percent compared with a year ago, excluding recent ""bulk"" liquidations of personal service companies caused by a change to the tax code.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 02:13AM ET</span>",China's June industrial profit growth eases as trade risks rise,"By Yawen Chen and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth for China's industrial firms eased in June from the previous month, as factory production slowed amid rising trade frictions with the United States and Beijing's ongoing efforts to cut pollution and debt.
Analysts say profits could be further crimped in the second half of the year as trade woes deepen, adding more pressure on growth in the world's second-largest economy. 
Industrial profits rose 20 percent to 658.29 billion yuan ($96.7 billion) in June, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Friday, compared with a 21.1 percent rise in May.
NBS said in a statement on the data that rising prices had cushioned firms' profits even as industrial production slowed in June, but it did not provide separate reasons for the slower profit growth.
Lisheng Wang, an economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said it was hard to tell what impact the trade tensions had on industrial firms in June, but economic headwinds were growing. 
""In the second half of this year there could be a more visible slowdown in export growth in China, which could put some downside pressure on profits,"" Wang said. 
Steel, building materials and oil extraction sectors were key drivers behind profit growth in the first half of the year, it added. But profit growth in textile, non-ferrous metal smelting and processing, and telecommunications and electronic equipment manufacturing profits fell during the same period from a year earlier.
For the first half of the year, industrial firms' profits grew 17.2 percent from a year earlier to 3.39 trillion yuan, accelerating from a 16.5 percent rise for January-May. 
The data covers firms with annual sales of at least 20 million yuan. 
China's economic growth slowed in the April-June period from the previous quarter while June's industrial output growth slumped to a four-year low, raising concerns about the outlook amid growing signs of stress.
The government's campaign to cut debt and emissions have driven up borrowing costs and curbed production for some key industries, while threats of further tariffs on Chinese goods from Washington add to the headwinds for the second quarter even as Beijing insists economic fundamentals are sound.
The central bank in June cut bank reserve requirements for the third time this year and has pumped more money into financial markets. Policymakers have so far ruled out the odds of a major stimulus package but have vowed to take necessary fiscal and monetary steps to support growth while urging banks to ensure adequate liquidity for smaller firms.
Nomura's Wang said despite some expected fiscal stimulus from the government to cushion the economy, he saw risks in the second half of the year due to weakening domestic demand, a slowing property market and China-U.S. trade tensions. 
""We still maintain our call that economic growth will slow visibly to 6.4 percent in the third quarter,"" Wang said.
The country's industrial firms have benefited over the past two years from hot property and infrastructure construction markets, which boosted demand for building materials such as steel bars and cement. Price growth of new homes accelerated to a near two-year high in June, on monthly terms, suggesting continued momentum despite recent government curbs.
However, there are challenges for producers with growth in fixed-asset investment hitting a record low in the first half of this year amid a war against pollution. Raw materials cost also rose at a faster clip than the producer price index in June, suggesting possible margin pressures.
PROFITS DECLINE
Despite the strong headline growth figure, the 658.29 billion yuan in total profits earned by China's large industrial firms was 9.5 percent lower than the nominal 727.8 billion yuan reported last June. 
The large and widening divergence in reported and implied profit growth has raised questions about the data.

The statistics bureau in June has addressed the issue three times within the last month, attributing the difference to changes in the sample size and statistical methodology. It said that fewer firms met the requirements to be included.
 
"
1367,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",China’s Industrial Profits Jump Again as Doubts Cloud Data,"(Bloomberg) -- Profit growth at Chinese industrial companies continued a streak of surges for the third month, as the statistics authorities tried to dismiss doubts on the credibility of such data.
Industrial profits advanced 20.0 percent in June from a year earlier, versus a 21.1 percent increase in May. Total profits for the month were 658.29 billion yuan ($96.7 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday.
A jump in producer prices, which accelerated to the fastest pace this year in June, bolstered the gain even as industrial output slowed more than expected. With factory inflation forecast to slow this year and proposed tariffs weighing on orders, such resurgence in earnings may not be sustainable.
""The profit growth is very healthy with reduced costs and robust inflation, "" said Liu Peiqian, Asia strategist at Natwest Markets PLC in Singapore. ""It may stabilize and gradually slow down rest of this year, but we would not rule out a rebound in the event of strong stimulus.""
The data series has recently attracted controversy, as the nominal value in May indicates a net decline while NBS reported a surge of more than 20 percent. The data mismatch showed up again this month. A simple calculation indicates a 9.5 percent decline in June from 727.78 billion yuan a year earlier, instead of a surge.
The discrepancies are due to changes in the survey sample, which covers only industrial firms with over 20 million yuan in annual revenue, and the gauge can ""accurately, objectively"" reflect changes at the companies, a spokesman at the bureau said at a briefing earlier this month. Closer scrutiny on the reported statistics as well as a crackdown on double accounting and over reporting have also led to the difference, according to the spokesman.
The profit boom benefits state companies more than others. Profits of state companies surged 31.5 percent in the first six months from a year earlier versus a 10 percent gain at the private firms and a 8.7 percent rise at the foreign ones, according to an NBS statement.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 11:49AM ET</span>",U.S. business spending on equipment strong; trade deficit widens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in June and shipments surged, pointing to solid growth in business spending on equipment in the second quarter.
Expectations of robust economic growth in the April-June period were, however, tempered somewhat by other data on Thursday showing a widening in the goods trade deficit last month and no change in retail and wholesale inventories.
""The U.S. economy surely strengthened in the second quarter, but likely ended the quarter on a softer touch, suggesting some slowing in the third quarter,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent increase in May. 
Orders increased broadly last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.4 percent in June after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in May. Core capital goods orders increased 6.8 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods jumped 1.0 percent last month after an unrevised 0.2 percent gain in May. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Business spending on equipment has risen since the fourth quarter of 2016. It is expected to have combined with robust consumer spending to boost second-quarter GDP growth.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP likely increased at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period, which would be double the 2.0 percent pace notched in the first quarter. The government will publish its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP growth on Friday.
But second-quarter GDP growth could miss expectations as the Commerce Department reported in another report on Thursday that the goods trade deficit shot up 5.5 percent in June to $68.3 billion. The goods trade deficit narrowed in April and May amid a surge in soybean exports as farmers rushed deliveries before China's retaliatory tariffs came into effect in early July.
The United States slapped duties on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, eliciting a similar response from Beijing. 
Goods exports dropped 1.5 percent to $141.9 billion last month, weighed down by declines in shipments of food, motor vehicles and capital, consumer and other goods. Imports of goods rose by $1.3 billion to $210.3 billion, driven by motor vehicles, industrial supplies and consumer and other goods.
INVENTORIES FLAT
The department also said both wholesale and retail inventories were unchanged in June. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve slashed its second-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3.8 percent rate from a 4.5 percent pace.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank kept its policy rate unchanged. Prices for U.S Treasuries rose while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
Business spending on equipment is being supported by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January. But there are worries that trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, could offset the fiscal stimulus.
""The momentum at the end of the second quarter signals that equipment spending likely will increase in the third quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 1.0 percent in June as demand for transportation equipment rebounded 2.2 percent. That followed a 0.3 percent drop in durable goods orders in May.
While a third report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended July 21, the data continued to point to a tightening job market. 
Claims dropped to 208,000 during the week ended July 14, which was the lowest reading since December 1969. The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. The economy created an average of 215,000 positions per month in the first half of this year. 

""By our calculations, the current break-even level of initial claims is 265,000, the lowest this cycle,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Initial claims would have to make a sustained break above this level to signal that either the labor market or the economy is in trouble.""

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended July 21, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims dropped to 208,000 during the week ended July 14, which was the lowest reading since December 1969.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 215,000 in the latest week. Claims data tends to be volatile around this time of the year when motor vehicle manufacturers shut assembly lines for annual retooling. 
The Labor Department said only claims for Maine were estimated last week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,750 to 218,000 last week, the lowest reading since mid-May.
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. Employment gains averaged 215,000 jobs per month in the first half of this year.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 8,000 to 1.75 million in the week ended July 14. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 9,500 to 1.75 million.
The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which July's unemployment rate will be derived. The four-week average of continuing claims rose by 25,750 between the June and July survey periods suggesting little change in the unemployment rate.

The jobless rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.0 percent in June as more Americans entered the labor force, in a sign of confidence in the labor market.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6 percent last month.
Data for May was revised higher to show the so-called core capital goods orders increasing 0.7 percent instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.4 percent last month. Core capital goods orders increased 6.8 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods jumped 1.0 percent last month after an unrevised 0.2 percent gain in May. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Business spending on equipment has risen since the fourth quarter of 2016. It is expected to have combined with robust consumer spending and strong export growth to boost second-quarter GDP growth.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP growth likely increased at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period, which would be double the 2.0 percent pace notched in the first quarter. The government will publish its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP growth on Friday.
Business spending on equipment is being supported by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January. But there are worries that trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, could offset the fiscal stimulus.
Last month, orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rebounded 1.5 percent after slipping 0.5 percent in May. Orders for computers and electronic products rose 0.6 percent while those for machinery gained 0.2 percent. 
There was also an increase in demand for fabricated metals. Orders for primary metals fell 0.4 percent.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 1.0 percent in June as demand for transportation equipment rebounded 2.2 percent. That followed a 0.3 percent drop in durable goods orders in May.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts jumped 4.4 percent last month, the biggest increase since March 2015, after plunging 4.5 percent in May. 

Orders for civilian aircraft rose only 4.3 percent last month, despite Boeing (N:BA) reporting on it website that it had received 233 aircraft orders, up from only 43 planes in May.

Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 7,000 to 215,000 for last week.
The four-week moving average was 218,000, down 2,750 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A rapid fall in capital investment slowed South Korea’s economic growth in the second quarter, while weaker export growth highlighted concerns over the outlook for trade in the second half of the year.
Gross domestic product grew a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in the second quarter, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said on Thursday, slowing from 1 percent growth over January to March, as expected. Year-on-year growth logged 2.9 percent, slightly below 3 percent growth seen in a Reuters survey. 
Investment in plant and equipment dropped 6.6 percent, the worst performance since a 7.1 percent fall in the first quarter of 2016 when large scale investment in manufacturing capacity to produce memory chips and display panels petered out.
""Investment on machines for production of memory chips and display panels is declining. Private consumption also took a hit from a downturn in activity by non-government organizations because the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang are over,"" a central bank official said. 
Private consumption gained 0.3 percent, logging the slowest growth in six quarters, while construction investment declined 1.3 percent after gaining 1.8 percent a quarter earlier.
Pyeongchang, a mountain county in South Korea's Gangwon province, hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics in February this year, which fed a boom in consumption and tourism. 
Exports, which account for about 43 percent of GDP, grew 0.8 percent in the second quarter after jumping 4.4 percent in the first.
Park Sang-hyun, an economist at Leading Investment & Securities, said global trade conflicts could undermine South Korea's exports in the second half.
""Problem is, the hostilities between the U.S. and China will affect South Korean exports,"" Park said. 

Second quarter exports added 1.3 percentage points to quarterly growth in the second quarter, while a fall in the broader domestic consumption category subtracted 0.6 percentage points, resulting in a quarterly expansion of 0.7 percent for the April-June period.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",UK pay deals see strongest run since 2008: XpertHR,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers continued to offer annual pay deals averaging 2.5 percent in June, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis, according to industry data that is likely to bolster the Bank of England's view that inflation pressures are building.
Wage data providers XpertHR said June was the sixth consecutive month when median pay deals stood at 2.5 percent, after not regularly exceeding 2 percent since late 2008.
Wages have lagged behind inflation for much of that period, squeezing the spending power of many households.
But with pay increases picking up a bit of speed, most economists expect the Bank of England to raise its key interest rate next week for only the second time since before the 2008 crisis to keep domestic inflation pressures in check.
The BoE forecast in May that average earnings growth - which typically slightly exceeds annual pay rises - would increase to 3 percent by the end of the year, potentially stopping inflation from returning to its 2 percent target unless it raises rates.
Upward pressure on pay is likely to persist with the government loosening curbs on public-sector wages that have been in place since 2010 as part of austerity measures.
More than 1 million teachers, doctors, military and police officers will receive pay rises of 2 percent or higher, after years of pay rises being largely restricted to 1 percent, the government announced this week.
""The current run of higher pay awards looks set to continue as we head into the quieter months of the pay bargaining year,"" XpertHR analyst Sheila Attwood said.
Factory workers are seeing the fastest pay rises, with a median 3 percent annual pay deal, the data showed.
By contrast, separate figures from the British Retail Consortium showed an ongoing squeeze on shop staff. The number of employees and hours worked in the sector are both down by almost 3 percent compared with last year, and full-time workers have been especially hard hit.

""Retailers seek greater flexibility in their workforce to cope with the pressure felt from the diverging costs of labor versus technology,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","UK housing starts slow, led by slump in London: NHBC","LONDON (Reuters) - British builders started work on slightly fewer new homes in the three months to the end of June, hit by a sharp fall in London, but overall construction remained close to its highest level since the global financial crisis, industry data showed.
Builders reported they were about to start work on 38,978 new homes in the second quarter of 2018, the National House-Building Council, an industry body that insures about 80 percent of new construction, said on Thursday.
The total was 3 percent smaller than in the same quarter of 2017, driven almost entirely by a 12 percent fall in new housing starts in London, where investor demand has faded since June 2016's Brexit vote.
Housing starts in the British capital have more than halved since the year before the Brexit vote.
Construction in the United Kingdom overall rebounded by 6 percent from the first three months of 2018, when unusually snowy weather delayed work.
""Demand for new homes across the UK remains strong,"" NHBC Chief Executive Steve Wood said. ""We have seen some promising numbers coming through, in particular during May and June.""
NHBC's measure of quarterly housing starts slumped below 17,000 during the depths of the financial crisis, before recovering to peak at 42,423 in early 2017, helped in part by government subsidies for buyers of newly built homes.
Boosting house-building has been a stated priority for Britain's government as it tries to address concerns among many voters about a lack of affordable housing in many areas.
But many in the industry say little has been done to speed up the local government planning process that makes it slow to get approval for many projects.
A separate report by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that difficulties in financing projects were also causing growth to slow.

""Anecdotal evidence suggested that the housing market slowdown, coupled with ongoing ambiguity with the Brexit negotiations, is weighing on investment decisions,"" RICS said.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 12:12PM ET</span>","U.S. new home sales at eight-month low, housing slowing","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to an eight-month low in June and data for the prior month was revised sharply lower, the latest indications that the housing market was slowing down.
The moderation in housing is largely driven by supply constraints, but there are concerns that persistent weakness could eventually spill over to the broader economy, which appeared to have grown robustly in the second quarter. 
Housing has been plagued by rising building material costs and shortages of land and labor, which have put a squeeze on the supply of homes available for sale and kept prices elevated. 
""The fallout could be weaker sales of consumer durable goods and furnishings that go into these new homes later on this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The second quarter could well prove to be the high-water mark for growth this year.""
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales decreased 5.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 631,000 units last month, the lowest since October 2017. May's sales pace was revised down to 666,000 units from the previously reported 689,000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10 percent of housing market sales, falling 2.8 percent to a pace of 670,000 units in June. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They increased 2.4 percent from a year earlier. Housing market data has weakened in recent months, with homebuilding falling to a nine-month low in June and home resales declining for a third straight month. Building permits also dropped to a nine-month low in June. 
""The housing market is flattening, and may have peaked for this expansion,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist for Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
The housing market has underperformed the economy this year. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy likely grew at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, which would be double the 2.0 percent pace set in the January- March period.
DRAG ON GROWTH 
Economists are forecasting no contribution from housing to gross domestic product in the second quarter. Residential investment subtracted from GDP growth in the first quarter. 
The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP on Friday.
""We do not expect housing to be an important driver of economic activity going forward but neither do we expect a retrenchment,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Higher mortgage rates have also raised the cost for owning a home, especially for first-time buyers, and may be discouraging some owners from selling their properties. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase a home fell 1.0 percent last week.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell nearly 2 percent, while the overall U.S. stock market was mixed. (N) The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies (DXY). Prices for U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) rose.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, declined 7.7 percent in June. Sales fell 5.2 percent in the West and tumbled 13.4 percent in the Midwest. They surged 36.8 percent in the Northeast to a 10-1/2-year high, however.
The median new house price fell 4.2 percent to $302,100 in June from a year earlier. 
""That prices were lower likely shows the dominance of homes sold in the south, where prices are lower, than a lack of demand,"" said Navy Federal Credit Union's Frick. 
While the stock of new homes on the market increased to a more than nine-year high of 301,000 units in June, supply is just over half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom in 2006. A survey last week showed single-family homebuilders complaining in July that ""they continue to be burdened by rising construction material costs.""
The Trump administration in April 2017 imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, which builders say have significantly raised the cost of a new home.
At June's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the most in 10 months and up from 5.3 months in May. Nearly two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

The CBI's retail sales balance fell to +20 in July from a nine-month high of +32, a slightly smaller drop than either retailers or economists polled by Reuters had expected.
Looking at the three months to July as a whole, sales growth of +21 was the highest since December 2016, but for August retailers expect sales growth to flatten.
""While the heatwave has boosted retail sales in recent months, we may be seeing some early signs of a cooling off, with orders falling in the year to July and retailers expecting no growth in sales next month,"" CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said.
British retail sales and the economy as a whole were weak in the first quarter of 2018, but subsequent signs of a pick-up have bolstered economists' expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next week.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business confidence dipped in July, a survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting a slew of risks, including the threat of U.S. tariffs on cars and car parts, is starting to unsettle company executives in Europe's largest economy.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index fell to 101.7 from 101.8 in June, but it did not register as big a drop as forecast. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 101.5.
U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy, along with a recent government crisis in Germany that was caused by a dispute over migration and has since been resolved, increased uncertainty, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
Companies felt slightly more upbeat about their current situation, but their expectations for the coming six months worsened, the survey showed.
""The current debate about tariffs probably made itself felt there - the trade disputes are making life in the corporate sector harder,"" said Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank.
Citing national security grounds, Washington imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico on June 1. Now Trump is threatening to extend them to EU cars and car parts - a worry for Germany, where the car industry accounts for some 800,000 jobs.
Export expectations in the auto industry have fallen significantly, Wohlrabe said.
At the weekend, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said it was difficult to estimate the impact of any U.S. car tariffs on the German economy. But tariffs on aluminum and steel were worth just over 6 billion euros ($7.02 billion), he said, and car tariffs would probably be about 10 times that.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will discuss trade with Trump at a meeting in Washington on Wednesday.
The weaker Ifo reading comes after a survey published earlier this month showed the mood among German investors slumped to its lowest since August 2012 amid concern about escalating trade tensions with the United States.
Despite the risks that the threat of a global trade war and Brexit pose, the government expects growth to accelerate slightly in the second quarter from 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economy shrank 5.8 percent in May versus the same month last year, government statistics agency Indec said on Tuesday, the second straight month of declines in a sign of looming recession and a possible GDP contraction in 2018.
The sharpest monthly decline since July 2009 was mostly caused by the grains powerhouse's worst drought in decades, which harmed soybean and corn crops. Farming activity shrank 35 percent year-over-year, while industrial output fell 1.4 percent and transport and communications fell 4.9 percent.
The drought was one factor behind a run on the peso currency and financial market volatility that prompted Argentina to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an emergency loan. Argentina has also suffered from a broader investor pullback from risky emerging market assets.
While the government began the year with rosy forecasts of growth above 3 percent this year after a 2.9 percent expansion in 2017, many analysts began predicting a recession -- two straight quarters of negative growth -- for 2018 after the country announced in May it was turning to the IMF. 
The Fund still expects a slight expansion of 0.4 percent in 2018, and the government says it could be even higher. But May's decline -- which exceeded the median estimate in a Reuters poll for a 1.3 percent contraction -- increased the chances that overall growth could be negative despite a strong first quarter.
""We see a very significant risk that the economy will experience a recession in 2018 ... and that real GDP (gross domestic product) growth in 2018 will dip into negative territory,"" Alberto Ramos, head of Latin America economics at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), wrote in a note. 
Tighter fiscal policy as the government cuts public works spending to reach its deficit targets and high interest rates as the central bank seeks to fight incessant inflation mean the economy would ""remain soft in coming quarters,"" Ramos wrote. 
Construction activity rose 4.4 percent in May, down substantially from the 10.2 percent increase in April, while wholesale and retail commerce rose 0.5 percent compared with 5.5 percent in May. The financial sector grew 10.8 percent and real estate activity grew 4 percent.
Economic activity declined 1.4 percent when compared with April, the data showed.

Indec also revised its estimates for April's economic activity to a 0.6 percent decline year-over-year, compared with 0.9 percent previously, and a 2.8 percent decline month-on-month, compared with 2.7 percent previously.

The preliminary reading of the Markit services purchasing managers’ index came in at 56.2 this month, down from 56.5 in June.
Economists had forecast no change.
The manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose to 55.5 in July, compared to 55.4 a month earlier.
Analysts had expected a reading of 55.1.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, fell to 55.9 this month from 56.2 in June.
The consensus forecast was looking for a drop to 56.0.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion and below indicates contraction.
Despite the drop in the composite index, IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson still considers the above-50 reading to be a good start to the third quarter.
“Although down from June, the July flash PMI is in line with the average for the second quarter and indicative of the economy growing at an annualized rate of approximately 3%,” he explained.
But Williamson noted that trade frictions have become a major cause of concern, especially among manufacturers.
“Firms have become increasingly worried about the impact of tariff and trade wars on demand, prices and supply chains,” he remarked.
“July saw the steepest rise in prices charged for goods and services yet recorded by the surveys as firms passed rising costs on to customers, in turn frequently linked to tariffs,” he added.
Williamson also pointed to the fact that supply chain delays also hit a record high amid rising shortages of key inputs and commented that it is “usually a harbinger of further price rises.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth slowed more than expected this month as fears over a trade war with the United States and a weaker global expansion put another dent in optimism, a survey showed on Tuesday.
But growth remained robust and as it was accompanied by rising prices the survey is unlikely to concern policymakers at the European Central Bank too much as they look to move away from their ultra-loose monetary policy.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dipped in July to 54.3 from June's 54.9, coming in below all forecasts in a Reuters poll with a median of 54.8.
Anything above 50 indicates growth.
If maintained, the latest PMIs point to third quarter economic growth of 0.4 percent in the euro zone, IHS Markit said. That is slightly weaker than the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last week. [ECILT/EU]
""July's fall in the euro zone PMI comes as something of a disappointment but the index is still consistent with a decent pace of GDP growth,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics. ""All in all, today's data are unlikely to deter the ECB from normalizing policy but the process is likely to be extremely gradual.""
The ECB guided markets for steady rates ""through the summer"" of 2019 at its meeting last month, when it also announced it would shut a 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying program in December, ending its unprecedented stimulus scheme.
Germany's private sector grew faster than expected in July, earlier figures showed, but French business growth eased more than predicted. France and Germany are the only two euro zone members to have flash numbers.
TRADING
Fears that trade conflict around the world is worsening have damaged confidence. The future output index, which gauges optimism, fell to 63.0 from 63.4, its lowest since late 2016.
""In July we have seen a big increase in the number of companies reporting they are worried about global economic growth and the impact of trade wars escalating,"" said Chris Williamson at survey compiler IHS Markit.
The United States has imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports, while threatening more, and President Donald Trump has called the European Union a trade foe.
""With the risk of a full-blown trade war increasing steadily, there is no reason to expect any sustained improvements in export orders and industry confidence over the next months,"" said Moritz Degler at Oxford Economics.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry fell to 54.4 from June's 55.2, missing expectations for a shallower drop to 55.0.
Worryingly for firms and also pointing to no pick-up, new business growth was at one of its weakest rates since the start of last year. The sub-index fell to 53.7 from 54.9.
However, manufacturers had a better July than expected. The factory PMI rose to 55.1 from 54.9, beating the median expectation for 54.6. An index measuring output - which feeds into the composite PMI - held steady at 54.2.
But factories slowed their purchasing of raw materials. The quantity of purchases index fell to 53.0 from 53.3, its lowest since September 2016.

The preliminary reading of the Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at a three month high of 57.3 this month from 55.9 in June. Economists had forecast a reading of 55.5.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The increase reflected stronger increases in output, new orders and stocks of purchases.
The report showed that price pressures intensified in July. Input price inflation accelerated for the third month running to the highest since January, widely linked to higher wages and fuel.
Manufacturers also highlighted increased steel prices, as well as supply shortages emanating from China which drove up prices.
The services PMI ticked down to a two month low of 54.4 from 54.5 a month earlier, against expectations for 54.6.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose to a five month high of 55.2 from 54.8. Economists had expected the composite index to tick down to 54.7.
The report pointed to a sustained strong pace of hiring across the private sector, with the rate of job creation unchanged from June’s five-month high.
Despite the sharper rate of growth in output in July, business confidence towards the year-ahead outlook for activity remained relatively subdued.
“Private sector output growth in Germany continued to regain momentum in July, having previously sank to a 20-month low in May. The manufacturing sector was the source of stronger growth in the latest month, after services had driven the expansion in June,"" said Trevor Balchin, economics director at survey compiler Markit.
“The latest survey also signalled greater inflationary pressures in July, with both input and output prices rising more steeply. Manufacturers widely reported higher steel prices, and supply shortages from China in general. Meanwhile, service providers hiked their own charges at the second-fastest rate on record.”"

A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Growth in the service sector was buoyed by an increase in new orders. Robust economic conditions and the football World Cup were also cited as factors contributing to growth.
The manufacturing PMI ticked up to a two month high of 53.1 from 52.5 a month earlier, against expectations for 52.6.
Although new orders rose, manufacturing exports were down for the first time since September 2016 amid reports that global trade tensions were hampering foreign demand.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors declined to a two month low of 54.5 from 55.0. Economists had expected the composite index to tick down to 54.8.
The report said that French companies retained an optimistic outlook with regard to coming 12-month period in July, buoyed by hopes of further demand growth. The degree of optimism ticked up from June and remained strong.
“The French private sector continued to grow at a decent lick at the start of the third quarter. The rate of expansion, however, remains far weaker than seen around the turn of the year"", said Alex Gill, economist at survey compiler MarkIt.
“Nevertheless, the rate of job creation and degree of business confidence remained strong at both manufacturers and service providers, suggesting the French private sector is poised for further solid near-term growth.”"

The Nikkei Japan Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturers for July showed a preliminary reading of 51.6, the lowest since November 2016, and down from 53.0 in June. Output came in at 52.4, down from 53.6, and the index for stocks of finished goods fell. A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, while one below that signals a contraction.

There wasn't much encouraging news for new export orders either, which shrank for the second month though the pace of contraction slowed to a preliminary 49.7 from a final 48.9 in June. 
Overall, the PMI result portends a darkening outlook as a U.S.-driven international trade war embroils major economies from China to Canada to the euro zone and threatens to dent Japan's export-oriented manufacturing sector.
A Reuters poll showed earlier this month that Japanese business sentiment slipped in July, reflecting companies' fear of fallout from the intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 01:09PM ET</span>",U.S. home sales sag as prices race to record high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell in June, posting their third straight monthly decline as a persistent shortage of properties on the market drove house prices to a record high. 
The report on Monday from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) added to last week's soft homebuilding data in suggesting that the housing market lagged an apparent acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. 
While supply constraints have accounted for the weak sales streak, there are growing concerns that the higher house prices and rising mortgage rates will cause demand to slow.
""The overall economy is in great shape, but there are a few cracks in the armor,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The key housing market is suffering from a major case of agita.""  
Existing home sales slipped 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units last month, the NAR said. May's sales pace was revised down to 5.41 million units from the previously reported 5.43 million units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales gaining 0.5 percent in June. Sales rose in the Northeast and Midwest. They fell in the West, which has seen a sharp rise in prices, and the South, where most of the homes are sold.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, dropped 2.2 percent from a year ago in June. They have declined on a year-over-year basis for four consecutive months and decreased 2.2 percent in the first half of 2018.
Sales are being stymied by an acute shortages of homes on the market. Rising building materials costs as well as shortages of land and labor have left builders unable to bridge the inventory gap, pushing up house prices. 
The median house price increased 5.2 percent from a year ago to an all-time high of $276,900 in June. That was the 76th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. 
The 30-year mortgage rate is around 4.52 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. In contrast, annual wage growth has been stuck below 3 percent. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) declined, underperforming a broadly flat stock market. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
TRAILING OVERALL ECONOMY
June's weak sales suggested a marginal gain in brokers' commissions in the second quarter. Economists expect little or no contribution from housing to second-quarter gross domestic product. 
Growth estimates for the April-June period are as high as a 5.2 percent annualized pace. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent rate in the first quarter, with residential investment contracting. The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP growth on Friday.
""Residential construction won't add much to second-quarter GDP growth,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Thankfully, there are still plenty of other cylinders - consumers, businesses and exporters - to fuel this economy amid turbo-charged fiscal policies.""
Housing supply is especially tight at the lower end of the market, with sales dropping 18 percent in June from a year ago. 
There were 1.95 million previously owned homes on the market in June, up 0.5 percent from a year ago. That was the first year-on-year increase since June 2015, but supply remains very tight. At June's sales pace, it would take 4.3 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 4.1 months in May.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. While last month's increase in the stock of houses on the market suggested that the inventory decline had probably run its course, the supply crunch is unlikely to ease soon. 
The Commerce Department reported last week that housing starts tumbled 12.3 percent to a rate of 1.173 million units in June, the lowest level in nine months, and well below the 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month range that realtors estimate is needed to alleviate the shortage.

Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 26 days in June, unchanged from the last three months and down from 28 days a year ago. Fifty-eight percent of homes sold in June were on the market for less than a month. The share of first-time buyers was unchanged at 31 percent last month.

Existing home sales fell 0.6% in June from the previous month to an annualized pace of 5.38 million units.
Economists had forecast a 0.5% increase to an annualized pace of 5.46 million.
Existing home sales account for 90% of the market and are calculated when a contract closes.
Existing-home sales decreased for the third-straight month in June, as declines in the South and West exceeded sales gains in the Northeast and Midwest, according to NAR.
NAR indicated that, after June’s decline, sales slid 2.2% from a year ago.
The report also showed that the median existing-home price for all housing types in June was $276,900, surpassing last month as the new all-time high and up 5.2% from June 2017 ($263,300). June’s price increase marks the 76th-straight month of year-over-year gains.
“There continues to be a mismatch since the spring between the growing level of homebuyer demand in most of the country in relation to the actual pace of home sales, which are declining,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.
Yun indicated that the principal cause of the decline was a “severe housing shortage”.
He noted that those houses on the market go under contract very fast and often receive multiple offers.
“This dynamic is keeping home price growth elevated, pricing out would-be buyers and ultimately slowing sales,” Yun explained."

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Britain records slightly larger than expected budget deficit in June,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government recorded a slightly bigger budget deficit than expected in June, although borrowing over the first three months of the financial year has been the lowest since 2007.
The deficit in June stood at 5.394 billion pounds, compared with 6.239 billion pounds a year ago, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 5.0 billion pounds.
So far this financial year, the deficit totals 16.8 billion pounds, down 24.4 percent from April-June 2017, though it is rarely possible to get a good steer on full-year borrowing trends after only three months of the financial year.
The figures may still cheer finance minister Philip Hammond, however. 
The deficit stood at 9.9 percent of GDP when Hammond's predecessor, George Osborne, took power in 2010 and started a multi-year program of public spending cuts. 
In March, Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expected the shortfall between how much the government spends and how much it earns from tax revenues to fall this financial year to 37.1 billion pounds, or 1.8 percent of GDP.
Since then, Prime Minister Theresa May has promised an extra 20 billion pounds a year in public healthcare funding, phased in over the next five years. Hammond has said he will explain how this will be funded in his autumn budget statement.
The OBR has estimated that Brexit will be a net drain on Britain's public finances, not a benefit.
Britain made more progress on improving the public finances last year than the OBR expected because the economy slowed less than feared after the 2016 Brexit referendum shock.
Hammond wants a budget surplus by the mid-2020s, in order to cut the national debt faster, as he believes debt as a share of GDP is too high to easily support a big rise in spending during a future deep recession.
Public debt, excluding the banks nationalized during the financial crisis, stood at 1.792 trillion pounds, or 85.2 percent of GDP, down from 86.2 percent of gross domestic product in June 2017 but double its level before the crisis.
The headline public sector net debt figures are inflated by a temporary Bank of England lending stimulus scheme which is due to be repaid this year - something which makes a near certainty of Hammond's goal to lower debt as a share of GDP.

Stripping out the effect of the BoE scheme, net debt as a share of GDP has generally fallen over the last two years but edged up in June to 76.1 percent from 75.7 percent in May.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 05:36AM ET</span>","Japan exports to U.S. fall, business mood sours amid fears of trade war","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports to the United States fell for the first time in 17 months and Japanese business sentiment soured amid worries about U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies.
Exports to the United States dipped 0.9 percent in June from the same period a year ago on waning shipments of cars and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, two of Japan's most important export products.
Thursday's trade data came on the heels of the Reuters Tankan, which showed business sentiment slipped in July, reflecting companies' fears about an intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China.
The batch of data highlighted concerns among Japanese policymakers who worry Trump may resort to tariffs or other protectionist measures to fix trade imbalances with Japan under his ""America first"" policy.
The government cut its view of business sentiment and warned that it must be ""vigilant"" about the impact that Sino-U.S. trade frictions could have on the global economy, which would in turn affect export-reliant Japan.
""Overall exports remain healthy for now, but we are not sure how things are going to turn out on the trade policy front,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. ""It's possible talk of tariffs and trade friction could reduce corporate investment.""
With Japanese imports from America down 2.1 percent, Japan's trade surplus with the United States widened 0.5 percent year-on-year to 590.3 billion yen ($5.24 billion). That could make it a potential target for Trump's protectionist policies.
Japan's global exports rose 6.7 percent in June, while imports gained 2.5 percent.
The Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan survey, found manufacturers' sentiment index stood at 25 in July, down one point from June, and the service sector's mood fell to 34 from 35 in the prior month.
The index subtracts the percentage of companies that feel negative about the economy from those who are optimistic, so a positive number means more businesses are upbeat.
TRADE PROTECTIONISM
Concerns about protectionism were widely cited in the Reuters poll of 483 large- and mid-sized companies, of which 268 responded between July 2-13. Exporters of cars, precision machinery and metal products were among those who dragged down manufacturers' sentiment.
Earlier this month the United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion of each other's goods.
""Our clients are increasingly taking a wait-and-see stance on capital expenditure in the face of uncertainty over trade friction between the United States and China and the EU,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey.
""Uncertainty is rising over capital spending plans at our client firms due to the expansion of protectionist policies and geopolitical risks,"" said another machinery maker.
The manufacturers' index is seen rising to 29 in October, while the service-sector index is expected to hold steady, after July's decline led by real estate/construction firms.
In its monthly report for July released on Thursday, the government kept intact its assessment for a seventh straight month that Japan's economy was ""recovering at a moderate pace"".
But it said business sentiment was ""almost flat,"" a bleaker view than in June when it said the mood was improving.
The downgrade came after the BOJ's tankan survey showed business confidence worsened for a second straight quarter in April-June, reflecting companies' jitters over Trump's protectionist policies.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>","UK second-quarter retail sales growth strongest since 2004, boosted by warm weather","LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales grew by the most in over a decade in the second quarter of 2018, official data showed on Thursday, giving the Bank of England reassurance shoppers had shaken off a sluggish start to the year as it considers raising interest rates.
Retail sales volumes in June alone were down 0.5 percent from May as the World Cup kept some shoppers out of stores and at the low end of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
But sales for the second quarter as a whole were 2.1 percent higher than the first three months of the year, the biggest calendar-quarter increase since the first quarter of 2004.
Retail sales growth and Britain's economy overall slowed in the first three months of 2018, due to heavy snow as well as ongoing pressures from high inflation and the anticipation of next year's Brexit, and the BoE said in May it would delay raising rates until it was sure that growth was back on track.
June retail sales were 2.9 percent higher than a year earlier versus forecasts of a 3.7 percent rise, slowing from 4.1 percent in May, which had been the fastest growth rate since November 2016.
The figures contrast with relatively soft wage growth and inflation data earlier this week which caused some economists to question whether the BoE will press ahead with a widely expected interest rate rise next month, only its second since the 2008 global financial crisis.
The ONS said the strong data for the retail sector - which makes up just 5 percent of the economy - would probably add 0.1 percentage points to second quarter GDP growth.
Earlier this month BoE Governor Mark Carney said the economy appeared to be growing as forecast - bolstering market expectations for a rise - though his deputy Jon Cunliffe, who opposed the last rate rise in November, said wages were growing a bit less than the BoE had forecast.
Overall economic growth in Britain this year is likely to be the weakest since 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund, which cut its forecast to 1.4 percent on Monday.
Cunliffe's view got a boost on Tuesday, when fresh data showed earnings rising at the slowest rate in six months. And on Wednesday inflation unexpectedly held steady, in part because heavy discounting of clothing negated the effect of higher fuel prices.
The latest retail sales data showed clothing sales suffered from the heat, but food and drink retailers did well as shoppers took advantage of unusually hot weather.
""Warm weather encouraged shoppers to buy food and drink for their BBQs,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said.
""However ... continued growth in food sales (was) offset by declining spending in many other shops as consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave,"" Murphy added.
Online clothing retailer ASOS (L:ASOS) reported rapid British sales growth last week, outstripping overseas sales.

But traditional clothing retailers such as Marks & Spencer (L:MKS),  Debenhams  (L:DEB) and House of Fraser have struggled, and furniture retailers DFS and Dunelm last week reported lackluster results, in part due to hot weather keeping shoppers away.

1408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",Australian Jobs Growth Trounces Expectations as Workforce Swells,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian employment surged by more than triple economists’ estimates in June and workforce participation swelled, supporting the Reserve Bank’s view that a stronger economy will spur hiring.
The economy added 50,900 positions, with the bulk of them full-time roles, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Thursday. Yet the jobless rate -- the key metric for policy makers -- held at 5.4 percent as participation jumped to 65.7 percent from 65.5 percent.
The gain in employment “brings an end to the soft patch since January,” said Paul Dales, chief economist for Australia at Capital Economics Ltd. “But at this stage, the unemployment rate isn’t low enough to prompt the RBA to decide that interest rates need to rise soon.”
The currency climbed to 74.25 U.S. cents at 12:44 p.m. in Sydney from 74 cents prior to the release.
A spurt of hiring absorbed by a burgeoning workforce is a reprise of 2017 when a red-hot labor market failed to substantially dent unemployment. The central bank tracks the jobless level rather than navigate through the volatile monthly jobs data. It’s relying on a strengthening economy to soak up spare capacity in the labor market and drive up inflation to potentially clear the path for the first interest-rate hike in almost eight years.
Today’s data showed New South Wales, the nation’s most populous state, led the hiring gains with 27,300 positions and also the advance in participation with a 0.2 percentage point rise. It was followed by the northeastern state of Queensland which added 14,800 positions.
Victoria, the second-largest state by population, posted the biggest decrease, shedding 6,600 positions as its unemployment rate climbed to 5.6 percent from 5.1 percent.
Pay Packets
“Hourly wages are creeping higher, signaling a continuing improvement in the jobs market. But businesses are still keen to cut costs and boost shareholder value rather than pass on pay increases to workers,” said Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at the securities unit of Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
“Overall, the labor market remains healthy,” he said. “The proportion of Australians in work or looking for work remains near record highs.”
The RBA estimated a jobless rate of about 5 percent represents full employment and should begin to spur wage gains. However, international experience suggests the level could be lower in the post-2008 global financial crisis environment.
Traders are pricing in little chance of a rate hike in the next 12 months and the central bank says it sees no near-term case for a policy adjustment.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>","Australia jobs jump in June, still plenty left to hire","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment surged by the most this year in June as firms took on more full-time workers, yet the jobless rate held steady as more people entered the labor force in a trend that has curbed much-needed wage gains.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released on Thursday showed 50,900 net new jobs were added in June, blowing past expectations of 17,000. Of those, 41,200 were in full-time positions.
It was the largest monthly gain since November and will be a big relief to policy makers after a run of softer months. Annual jobs growth also picked up to 2.8 percent, well ahead of the U.S. pace of job creation of 1.6 percent.
The unemployment rate held steady at 5.4 percent, but only because more people went looking for work. The participation rate jumped to 65.7 percent, just a tick below the all-time high, as more women entered the labor force.
With labor supply still expanding to meet demand, there has been less upward pressure on wages and inflation and thus no near-term trigger for a rise in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
""This report will give them a bit of confidence that some of the weakness we saw in employment earlier this year was temporary,"" said RBC senior economist Su-Lin Ong.
""Having said that, there is still a lot of slack in the market,"" she added. ""You still have to see ongoing above trend and above average job growth to absorb that spare capacity, and you need more prints of this magnitude to ease the slack and lift wages growth.""
The RBA has held rates at a record low 1.5 percent for almost two years and markets imply scant chance of a move until well into 2019. Interbank futures <0#YIB:> only show a 50-50 chance of a hike by August next year.
That flat outlook limited gains in the local dollar, which managed to rise only a third of a cent on the data to $0.7430 .
CATCHING UP WITH VACANCIES
Much of the gains in employment over recent years has been in the health and social assistance industry, sectors that have high female participation.
More recently the fastest growth has been in professional, scientific and technical services - everything from architecture to engineering, computer systems, law and accountancy.
This sector now has over 1.1 million jobs, making it the fourth largest employer after health, retail trade and accommodation and food services. These jobs tend to be full-time and to pay above average, which has helped support overall incomes even as wage growth lagged.
The outlook for employment is also upbeat if leading indicators of labor demand are to be believed.
Particularly promising has been the ABS series on job vacancies, which surged 24 percent in the year to May to reach an all-time peak of 236,000.
The RBA made much of this strength in minutes of its July Board meeting released on Tuesday, which emphasized that vacancies had reached the highest level as a share of the labor force since the series began in the late 1970s.
As a result, Board members: ""noted that wage pressures had been building in some parts of the economy but had not yet become broadly based.""

Analysts strongly suspect that until those pressures do broaden, interest rates will stay at record lows.

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",Japan exports to U.S. fall for first time in 17 months amid protectionism fears,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports to the United States fell in June for the first time in 17 months amid worries about U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies. 
Exports to the United States fell 0.9 percent in June from the same period a year ago due to a decline in shipments of cars and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, two of Japan's most important export products.
The decline, while slight, could still raise concerns among Japanese policymakers who worry whether Trump will push Japan to take concrete measures to lower its trade surplus with the United States.
""Overall exports remain healthy for now, but we are not sure how things are going to turn out on the trade policy front,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""It is possible talk of tariffs and trade friction could reduce corporate investment.""
Imports from the United States fell 2.1 percent year-on-year due a decline in crude oil, aircraft, and coal.
As a result, Japan's trade surplus with the United States was 590.3 billion yen, up 0.5 percent from the same period a year ago.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States may draw criticism as Trump's administration raises tariffs to lower the U.S. trade deficit and combat what it says are unfair trade policies.
The United States this month imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods to lower the U.S. trade deficit, and China quickly retaliated with an increase in tariffs on U.S. goods.
Trump has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a blow to Japanese exporters, and has also criticized Japan for the small number of American vehicles it imports.
Japan's overall exports rose 6.7 percent in June from the same period a year ago, less than the median estimate for a 7.0 percent annual increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. Exports grew an annual 8.1 percent in May.
Exports are likely to continue to grow because global demand remains firm, but Japan's trade surplus with the United States makes it a potential target for Trump's protectionist policies.
Japan's imports rose 2.5 percent in the year to June, versus the median estimate for a 7.0 percent increase.

The trade balance was a surplus of 721.4 billion yen ($6.40 billion), versus the median estimate for a 534.2 billion yen surplus.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through July 9, showed the U.S. economy and inflation expanded at a modest pace, but manufacturers in all districts reported concerns over tariffs and tight labor markets.
""Manufacturers in all Districts expressed concern about tariffs and in many Districts reported higher prices and supply disruptions that they attributed to the new trade policies,"" according to the Fed’s beige book. ""All Districts reported that labor markets were tight and many said that the inability to find workers constrained growth.""
Concerns over trade tensions come as Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell warned Wednesday that protectionism policies could hurt the U.S. economy.
""The bottom line is that a more protectionist economy is an economy that is less competitive, less productive. We know that. It is not a good thing if this is where it goes,"" Powell said in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
The pace of inflation was supported by ""strong"" increases in price pressures across key inputs, while wages growth continued to at a ""modest to moderate"" pace, according to the Fed's Beige Book.
""The prices of key inputs rose further, including fuel, construction materials, freight, and metals; a few Districts described these input price pressures as elevated or strong.""

1414,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts hit nine-month low; permits drop,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a nine-month low in June and permits for future construction declined for a third straight month, dealing a blow to the housing market as it struggles with a dearth of properties available for sale.
The bigger-than-expected decrease in housing starts and surprise drop in permits reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday suggested homebuilding could be plateauing against the backdrop of more expensive lumber, and land and labor shortages.
""We're seeing pressure on both sides of the market, from increasingly expensive inputs on the supply side to prices that are charging ahead of wage growth on the demand side, and the result is that neither builders nor buyers can keep up,"" said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. 
Housing starts tumbled 12.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.173 million units last month, the lowest level since September 2017, the Commerce Department said. The percent drop was the largest since November 2016 and both single and multi-family home construction declined in June.
Data for May was revised down to show starts rising at a 1.337 million-unit rate instead of the previously reported 1.350 million-unit rate. Starts fell in all four regions last month.
Building permits dropped 2.2 percent to a rate of 1.273 million units, also the lowest level since September 2017. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a pace of 1.320 million units last month and permits rising to a rate of 1.330 million units.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading lower, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were mostly flat. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, decreased 9.1 percent to a rate of 858,000 units in June. Single-family homebuilding has lost momentum since hitting a pace of 948,000 units last November, which was the strongest in more than 10 years.
RISING MATERIAL COSTS
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders unchanged in July, with builders continuing to be ""burdened by rising construction material costs."" 
The Trump administration in April 2017 imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, which builders say have boosted the price of a new single-family home, further reducing affordability for many first-time buyers. 
Mortgage rates have also risen, though they are still low by historic standards. At the same time, wage growth has been moderate. Residential investment contracted in the first quarter. June's sharp drop in homebuilding suggested housing was probably a drag on growth in the second quarter.
The housing market is lagging overall economic growth, which appears to have accelerated in the second quarter after hitting a soft patch at the start of the year. Growth estimates for the April-June period are as high as a 5.3 percent annualized rate, more than double the 2.0 percent pace in the first quarter.
""The June report builds on what has been a soft run for many of the housing indicators through much of the year to date, and it signals that residential investment will likely continue to look weak in the coming months,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
While permits to build single-family homes rose 0.8 percent in June to a pace of 850,000 units, they continued to trail starts. This suggests limited scope for a pick-up in single-family homebuilding in the months ahead.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment plunged 19.8 percent to a rate of 315,000 units in June. Groundbreaking on buildings with five units or more fell to a 10-month low.
Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 7.6 percent to a pace of 423,000 units. 
In another sign supply will remain tight, housing completions were unchanged at a rate of 1.261 million units in June, with single-family units falling 2.3 percent.
Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. 

The stock of housing under construction slipped 0.5 percent to 1.121 million units. Single-family homes under construction last month dipped 0.2 percent to 515,000 units.

With inflation outstripping wage growth consumers are facing a cost of living squeeze, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production increased in June, boosted by a sharp rebound in manufacturing and further gains in mining output, the latest sign of robust economic growth in the second quarter.
But the outlook for the industrial sector is uncertain against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, which threaten to disrupt global trade. A strong dollar and shortage of workers also pose a risk to production, with factory surveys suggesting some strain in the supply chain.
""Time will tell if this disruption in foreign trade will slow the overall U.S. economy because manufacturers cannot get what they need to produce goods here for domestic consumption and for exports,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday industrial production rose 0.6 percent last month after falling 0.5 percent in May. It 
accelerated at a 6.0 percent annualized rate in the second quarter after a 2.4 percent growth pace in the first quarter.
Manufacturing output surged 0.8 percent in June after decreasing 1.0 percent in May. A 7.8 percent jump in motor vehicle production buoyed manufacturing output last month. Motor vehicle production declined 8.6 percent in May after a fire at a parts supplier caused a sharp drop in the assembly of trucks.
Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing production rose 0.3 percent in June. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is being supported by a strong domestic and global economy. The data came on the heels of a report on Monday showing retail sales not only rose solidly in June, but were much stronger than previously reported in May. 
Strong industrial production and retail sales, together with smaller trade deficits in April and June suggest economic growth accelerated sharply in the second quarter. 
Gross domestic product estimates for the April-June quarter are as high as a 5.3 percent rate, more than double the first quarter's 2 percent pace.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street rose as did prices for U.S. Treasuries.
EYES ON TARIFFS
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell struck an upbeat note on the economy when he appeared before lawmakers on Tuesday, saying it was on the cusp of ""several years"" of strong jobs and low inflation. Powell, however, said ""it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy.""
The International Monetary Fund warned on Monday that tit-for-tat import tariffs threatened to derail the global economic recovery, adding that the U.S. was especially vulnerable to a slowdown in its exports. 
Economists said the Trump's administration's protectionist trade policy and retaliation by other countries could undercut business spending. The tariffs are also seen raising prices for consumers, which could slow domestic demand. A strong dollar, which has gained about 4 percent versus the currencies of the United States' main trade partners, could hurt exports. 
""Tariff uncertainty could cause businesses to cut capital expenditures and production,"" said Stephen Ciccarella, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Manufacturing output increased at a 1.9 percent rate in the second quarter after growing at a 1.7 percent pace in first quarter. In June, there was an increase in the production of wood, computer and electronic products as well as aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment. 
Mining production increased 1.2 percent, adding to the 2.2 percent rise in May. Mining output is now at a record high. 
Oil and gas well drilling rose 2.9 percent in June, with further gains likely following recent increases in oil prices. Mining output accelerated at a 19.4 percent rate in the second quarter after notching a 11.0 percent pace in the first quarter. 
Utilities output fell 1.5 percent in June, despite a heat-wave which engulfed parts of the country, after declining 0.7 percent in May.
With production increasing solidly last month, capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased to 78.0 percent from 77.7 percent in May. It is 1.8 percentage points below its 1972-to-2017 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",UK pay growth slows to six-month low despite record employment,"LONDON (Reuters) - British workers' pay growth has slowed to its weakest rate in six months despite record employment, adding to the Bank of England's conundrum as it considers whether to raise interest rates for only the second time since the global financial crisis.
Average weekly earnings rose by 2.5 percent on the year in the three months to May, losing speed from the previous three month period when they grew by 2.6 percent and its weakest since the three months to November, the Office for National Statistics said.
Pay growth excluding bonuses - which the BoE says sometimes gives a better picture of the underlying trend, slowed by a similar amount, to 2.7 percent. Both readings were in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's economy appears to be picking up after a slow first three months of the year, when unusually heavy snow hurt demand, and the central bank worries it is bumping up against the speed limit that would start to push up inflation.
Tuesday's data showed the unemployment rate remained at its joint-lowest since 1975 at 4.2 percent while the proportion of people in work rose to a record high of 75.7 percent after 137,000 jobs were created over the three months to May.
But economic growth since 2016's Brexit vote has been weak by historic standards due to high inflation and business uncertainty, and on Monday the International Monetary Fund cut Britain's growth forecast for 2018 to 1.4 percent.
Pay growth is one of the pieces of data the Bank of England is likely to look most closely at as it mulls whether to raise interest rates next month in what would be only the second rate increase since before the 2008 global financial crisis.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said at the start of the month that both the economy as a whole and pay were growing as the central bank had forecast in May, smoothing the way for an August rate rise.
But last week one of his deputies, Jon Cunliffe, who opposed November's rate rise, said pay growth did not seem to be breaking out of its recent 2.5-3.0 percent range and heading toward the 3 percent growth rate the BoE predicts for the end of the year.
Britain had seen numerous 'false dawns' for pay growth in the past, and there could be more spare capacity in the labor market than the central bank thought, he added.
""We've had yet another record employment rate, while the number of job vacancies is also a new record. From this it's clear that the labor market is still growing strongly,"" ONS statistician Matt Hughes said.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 01:38PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. retail sales lift second-quarter GDP estimates,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose solidly in June as households boosted purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods, cementing expectations for robust economic growth in the second quarter.
Signs of a strengthening economy, together with a tightening labor market and firming inflation, likely will keep the Federal Reserve on track to continue raising interest rates this year.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell offered an upbeat assessment of the economy last Friday, telling lawmakers that ""over the first half of this year, overall economic activity appears to have expanded at a solid pace."" The U.S. central bank raised interest rates in June for the second time this year and has forecast two more rate hikes by the end of 2018. 
""This puts the economy in a very, very good position as it starts its 10th year of forward movement in July,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""This strengthening economy gives the Federal Reserve the green light to raise rates a third time this year at their September meeting."" 
The Commerce Department said on Monday retail sales increased 0.5 percent last month. Data for May was revised to show sales rising 1.3 percent, the largest since September 2017, instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent gain.
Economists had forecast retail sales rising 0.5 percent in June. Retail sales in June gained 6.6 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were unchanged last month after an upwardly revised 0.8 percent increase in May. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have risen 0.5 percent in May. 
Given the upward revision to May's data, the unchanged reading in core retail sales last month did not change views consumer spending accelerated in the second quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, braked in the January-March period, growing at its slowest pace in nearly five years.
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were lower. U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest rate-sensitive two-year note (US2YT=RR) rising to a near 10-year high.[L8N1UC4KW]
TARIFFS POSE A THREAT
In addition to the solid retail sales data, a sharp narrowing of the trade deficit in April and May has also bolstered expectations of a strong GDP reading for the second quarter. Second-quarter growth expectations were supported by another report from the Commerce Department on Monday showing business inventories increased 0.4 percent in May.
Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers raised its April-June quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.1 percent annualized rate from 4.9 percent. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent pace in the first quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP later this month.
Escalating trade conflicts, however, pose a risk to the economy's outlook. The United States is embroiled in tit-for-tat import tariffs with major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union. 
Concerns about trade tariffs are starting to have some impact on both consumer and business confidence.
Consumer sentiment dipped in early July and a survey by the New York Fed published on Monday showed a moderation in factory activity in New York state in July amid a pullback in new order growth and shipments. Firms were also less optimistic about business conditions over the next six months. 
The survey's measures of both planned capital expenditures and technology spending declined sharply this month.
The International Monetary Fund also warned on Monday that the trade wars threatened to derail the global economic recovery, adding that the United States was especially vulnerable to a slowdown in its exports.
""Depending on what portion of the tariff businesses pass onto buyers, the additional burden on each household in the U.S. is between $120 to $200 per year,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics in Los Angeles. 
""While this may not sound large, some sectors of the economy like agriculture would be hit hard. Negative effects from financial markets could also add to consumer worries."" 
In June, auto sales rose 0.9 percent after advancing 0.8 percent in May. There were increases in online sales as well as receipts at service stations, building materials stores, furniture shops and restaurants and bars. 

But sales at clothing stores fell 2.5 percent, the biggest drop since February 2017. Sales at supermarkets, electronics and appliance stores and general merchandise shops also fell. Americans also cut back spending on hobbies.

The Commerce Department said business inventories increased 0.4 percent after an unrevised 0.3 percent gain in April. May's rise in inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product, was in line with economists' expectations.
Retail inventories increased 0.4 percent in May as reported in an advance estimate published last month. Retail inventories rose 0.4 percent in April.
Motor vehicle inventories increased 0.9 percent in May and not 1.0 percent as reported last month. Auto inventories rose 0.8 percent in April.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, edged up 0.1 percent in May as reported last month. They gained 0.2 percent in April.
Inventory investment was neutral to first-quarter economic growth. Economists expect a modest contribution from inventory accumulation to second-quarter growth.
Business sales jumped 1.4 percent in May, the biggest gain since September 2017, after increasing 0.6 percent in April.
At May's sales pace, it would take 1.34 months for businesses to clear shelves. That was the smallest inventories/sales ratio since December 2014 and was down from 1.35 months in April.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Re-sales of Canadian homes rose 4.1 percent in June from the previous month, the Canadian Real Estate Association said on Monday, as the impact on buyers of tougher mortgage rules eased.
The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, fell 10.7 percent from a year earlier to a five-year low. The group's Home Price Index was up 0.9 percent from June 2017.
Canada's housing market, which had cooled in the last year in response to rising interest rates and tighter mortgage rules - dubbed a stress-test - is showing some signs of starting to take the restrictions in stride.
A year ago, housing sales and prices were at or near record levels in many parts of Canada, but a series of regulatory changes, taxes on foreign buyers, tighter mortgage rules and rising interest rates have since reined in demand.
Despite the improvement, sales activity remains below the 10-year monthly average, and rising mortgage rates are expected to keep a lid on activity and price gains, Gregory Klump, CREA's chief economist, said in a statement on the group's website. 
""The number of homes trading hands has a long way to go before it returns to levels posted in recent years,"" Klump said. 
The number of newly listed homes fell 1.8 percent in June and remained below levels for the month in past years. With new listings down and sales up, the national sales-to-new listings ratio rose to 54.3 percent in June from 51.2 percent in May. A ratio between 40 and 60 is considered balanced, and the long-term average is 53.4 percent.
There were 5.4 months of inventory on a national basis at the end of June, down from May's three-year high and compared with the long-term average of 5.2 years, CREA said.
The average price for homes sold in June, not seasonally adjusted, fell 1.3 percent from a year earlier to just under C$496,000 ($377,473.36).

The consensus forecast had been for a reading of 22.0.
Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions, and below indicates worsening conditions.
Despite the drop in the headline general business conditions index, the NY Fed indicated that it was “still a high level, suggesting a continuation of robust growth.”
The new orders index dipped three points to 18.2, while the shipments index fell nine points to 14.6, pointing to a modest pullback in growth of orders and shipments.
Delivery times continued to rise, and inventories fell marginally, the report showed.
“Labor market indicators pointed to continued sturdy growth in employment and a modest increase in the workweek,” the NY Fed added.
Although the prices paid index slipped ten points to 42.7, it remained at what the NY Fed considered to be “a fairly high level indicative of widespread ongoing input price pressures”.
“Looking ahead, firms were slightly less optimistic about the six-month outlook than they were last month,” the report concluded."

Retail sales for May were revised to a gain of 1.3% from a previously reported 0.8% increase.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4%, also in line with forecasts. Core sales rose 1.4% in the preceding month.
Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth."

The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said the 19-country currency bloc had a goods trade surplus of 16.5 billion euros ($19.3 billion) in May, compared with 19.3 billion a year earlier, according to non seasonally adjusted estimates.
The reduced surplus was caused by a 0.8 percent fall in exports compared with a year earlier, while imports rose 0.7 percent.
Last week, the European Commission cut its growth forecast for the euro zone for 2018, citing trade tensions as one of the main reasons for the slowdown.
Figures adjusted for seasonal effects showed a drop in the surplus to 16.9 billion euros in May from 18.0 billion euros in April. Month-on-month, euro zone exports rose by 0.2 percent, while imports increased by 0.9 percent.
The trade balance for the whole of the European Union was nearly flat in May, recording a marginal surplus of 0.2 billion euros, compared with 2.3 billion a year earlier, non seasonally adjusted estimates showed.
The 28-country EU expanded the surplus in its trade in goods with the United States, the bloc's main trade partner, to 54.8 billion euros in the period between January and May compared with 48.1 billions in the same period of the previous year.
In the first five months of the year, before the U.S. decision on June 1 to introduce import tariffs on EU steel and aluminum, the EU increased its overall exports to the U.S. by 2.1 percent and reduced its imports by 3.1 percent.

Beijing’s trade war with the US were cited as headwind for domestic demand. Gross domestic product grew at 6.8% in the previous three quarters.
While the official GDP readings were largely in line with market expectations, the country’s industrial output grew 6% year-on-year in June, which was slower than the expected 6.5%. The data showed slowing momentum and prompted analyst to call for stronger government measures to support growth.
Retail sales on the other hand rose 9% year-on-year in June, beating the general consensus of a 8.8% increase, although its impact on stock markets seemed to be limited.
""China's economy can be knocked, and when it comes to trade, it influences a lot of sectors, a lot of jobs associated with it. Net export sheds are a small percent of GDP but your brain is only 3 percent of your body mass [and] losing 3 percent can be very important to you,"" said Fraser Howie, an independent analyst in an interview with CNBC.
The risks from the U.S.-China trade war is expected to be a drag on overall growth in the next few years, and Beijing is likely to continue easing monetary policy going forward, analysts said.
On the other hand, spokesman from the National Bureau of Statistics Mao Shengyong said following the release of the GDP data that trade disputes with the U.S. is not likely to affect China's consumer prices, and consumer spending is expected to remain steady in the second half of the year.

The economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, cooling slightly from the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday.
Activity data for June also indicated slowing momentum, backing views that growth is cooling, with some analysts calling for the government to take stronger measures to support the economy
""They need to slow financial deleveraging slightly and to turn their focus more on growth-supportive measures, for example increasing liquidity through (bank reserve requirement) cuts,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China Economist at ING in Hong Kong.
""If the situation gets worse a lot faster than what we expect I do think Chinese authorities need to beef up supportive measures, both fiscal and monetary.""
First half fixed asset investment growth was a record low, while industrial output for June matched the slowest growth rate in over two years at 6.0 percent and missed forecasts centered on 6.5 percent expansion.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the economy to expand 6.7 percent in the April-June quarter.
On a quarterly basis, growth picked up 1.8 percent from 1.4 percent in the first quarter, beating expectations of 1.6 percent growth.
The world's second largest economy has already felt the pinch from a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending that has driven up corporate borrowing costs, prompting the central bank to pump out more cash by cutting reserve requirements for lenders.
Data on Friday showed China's exports grew at a solid pace in June, though analysts suggest front-loading of shipments ahead of tariffs taking effect may have boosted the figures. More worryingly, the trade surplus with the United States hit a record high last month and looks set to keep a bitter tariff dispute with Washington on the boil for a while longer.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the stakes in its trade row with China, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items.
Other data showed retail sales rose 9.0 percent in June from a year earlier, in line with market forecasts.
Faced with a slowdown in domestic demand and the potential fallout from the trade war, Chinese policymakers have started to step up policy support for the economy and have softened their stance on deleveraging.
China's economy is likely to experience a mild slowdown in the second half of the year as financial market risks become ""obvious"" and demand is expected to decline, official think tank State Information Center (SIC) recently said.
The nation's financial regulator has told banks to ""significantly cut"" lending rates for small firms in the third quarter in comparison with the first quarter, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week.
The People's Bank of China, which has cut banks' reserve requirements three times this year, has recently replaced its use of the term ""deleveraging"" with ""structural deleveraging"", a change that suggests less harsh curbs on debt.
Nomura economists said in a recent note they expected the PBoC to deliver at least one more RRR cut before year-end, likely by 100 basis points and increase direct funding to the real economy via other liquidity injection tools, such as the supplementary lending facility.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 11:17AM ET</span>",U.S. import prices post biggest drop in over two years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell the most in more than two years in June as prices for petroleum products fell and a strong dollar weighed on the costs of other goods.
Economists said the unexpected drop in import prices reported by the Labor Department on Friday was likely temporary given tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on lumber, steel and aluminum imports to protect domestic industries from what it says is unfair foreign competition. 
The government has also slapped 25 percent duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports and President Donald Trump this week threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. 
""Odds are that the tariffs will begin to boost import prices,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The inflationary impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs has been modest, partly because a number of countries initially were exempt, but that has changed.""
The Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.4 percent last month, the largest decline since February 2016, after jumping 0.9 percent in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices edging up 0.1 percent in June. 
In the 12 months through June, import prices increased 4.3 percent following a 4.5 percent advance in May. 
Imported food prices dropped 2.6 percent last month, the biggest decrease since February 2012, after rising 0.4 percent in May. Prices for imported petroleum fell 0.8 percent after accelerating 7.4 percent in May. June's drop reflected a decline in crude oil prices, which has since reversed.
STRONG DOLLAR
Excluding petroleum, import prices slipped 0.3 percent in June. That was the largest drop in two years and followed a 0.1 percent gain in the prior month. Import prices excluding petroleum rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months through June.
Import prices excluding petroleum were probably held down by the dollar's 1.6 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in June. 
The dollar has firmed 3.8 percent on trade-weighted basis so far this year, which supports economists' thesis of a gradual increase in inflation even as the labor market tightens.
An inflation measure tracked by the Federal Reserve for monetary policy hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in May for the first time in six years. Inflation is expected to modestly overshoot its target.
""While we think a tightening labor market will keep upward pressure on pricing in the US, the recent strengthening in the dollar, along with declines in various commodity prices related to food and energy, likely depressed the June import price data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Import prices for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials increased 0.3 percent in June, driven by higher prices for metals and paper, after rising 0.8 percent in the prior month. 
The cost of imported capital goods fell 0.1 percent for a second straight month as did prices for imported motor vehicles. Consumer goods prices, excluding automobiles, recorded their biggest drop since November 2016.
While prices for goods imported from China were unchanged in June, they rose 0.5 percent year-on-year, which was the largest gain in two years. 
""Once the tariffs start feeding through, import prices are likely to reflect them first,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington. ""It will then likely feed through with a longer lag and to a smaller extent to producer prices and consumer prices.""

The Labor Department also reported that export prices increased 0.3 percent in June after rising 0.6 percent in May. Prices for agricultural products fell 1.0 percent last month, pulled down by a 2.6 percent drop in soybean prices. Export prices for corn tumbled 3.1 percent.

1436,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Sentiment Falls in July as Tariff Worries Escalate,"Investing.com – U.S. consumer sentiment was on the decline, hitting a six-month low, as tariff worries more than doubled, dampening optimism over the economy, according to a report published Friday.
The preliminary publication of the data for July from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment fell to 97.1, its lowest level since January, from 98.2 a month earlier.
Analysts had forecast a drop to just 98.1.
The current conditions indicator increased to 113.9 in July, from the previous 111.8.
Economists had projected that the index would rise to just 113.0.
Additionally, consumer expectations unexpectedly decreased to 86.4 in July, from the previous 89.1.
That missed consensus that had expected a rise to 89.7.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months decreased to 2.9% from 3.0%, while the five-year gauge fell to 2.4% from the previous 2.5%.
The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin indicated that although sentiment dropped in early July, it still “remained nearly equal to the average in the prior twelve months (97.7) and since the start of 2017 (97.4)”.
“The continuing strength has been due to favorable job and income prospects, with consumers under age 45 anticipating the largest income gains since July 2000,” Curtin explained.
Curtin pointed out that strength in jobs and incomes has overcome higher inflation and interest rates.
Consumers' tariff concerns on the rise
“The darkening cloud on the horizon, however, is due to rising concerns about the potential negative impact of tariffs on the domestic economy,” Curtin warned.
He noted that negative concerns about the potential impact had risen from 15% in May to currently 38% in July, while 52% of those surveyed in the top third of income distribution - equivalent to half of consumer spending - negatively mentioned the economic impact.
“Among those who expressed negative views of the tariffs, the Expectations Index was 30.5 points below those who made no mention of tariffs, and in addition, the expected inflation rate was six-tenths of a percentage point higher,” Curtain said.
“While consumers may not understand the intricacies of trade theory, they have substantial experience making decisions about the timing of discretionary purchases based on prospective trends in prices,” he concluded."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's trade deficit  widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee.
Though merchandise exports rose 17.57 percent year-on-year in June, the trade deficit widened to $16.6 billion from $14.62 billion in May. Oil imports rose 56.61 percent to $12.73 billion.
The oil import bill of India, the world's third biggest crude importer, rose sharply with global oil prices amid concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran would remove a substantial volume of crude oil from the world markets. 
Washington, which had pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, is pushing countries to halt imports of Iranian oil from November.
India's trade balance is further bruised by a weakening Indian rupee  that hit an all-time low against the dollar last month. 
The depreciating rupee and a widening trade deficit pose a challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is aiming to boost economic growth ahead of national elections, due early next year.
Late last month, Subhash Chandra Garg, the economic affairs secretary in the finance ministry, had said the trade deficit was expected to widen but the outlook was unclear.
""We are not even certain what kind of a storm it is or even if it is a storm or whether it will turn out to be a storm,"" Garg said. 
""Oil has played a spoilsport in both imports and exports. It has incrementally added $1.23 billion on imports and simultaneously a reduction in petroleum exports has been of $1.17 billion on month,"" said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank Ltd in Mumbai. 
Merchandise exports  last month rose to $27.7 billion from a year ago, while imports  rose 21.31 percent year-on-year to $44.3 billion, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement.

India's gold imports fell 2.8 percent year-on-year to $2.39 billion in June, the statement said.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",China's trade surplus with U.S. hits record as exporters rush to beat tariffs,"By Yawen Chen and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as its overall exports grew at a solid pace, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington.
But signs exporters were rushing shipments before tariffs went into effect in the first week of July suggest the spike in the surplus was a one-off, with analysts expecting a less favorable trade balance for China in coming months as duties on exports start to bite. 
The data came after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in its trade row with China on Tuesday, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items.
China's trade surplus with the United States, which is at the center of the tariff tussle, widened to a record monthly high of $28.97 billion, up from $24.58 billion in May, according to Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. 
The record surplus ""won’t help already sour relations and escalating tensions"", Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office at Everbright Sun Hung Kai, wrote in a note. 
Trump, who has demanded Beijing cut the trade surplus, could use the latest result to further ratchet up pressure on China after both sides last week imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods. Washington has warned it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - nearly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. 
The dispute has jolted global financial markets, raising worries a full-scale trade war could derail the world economy. Chinese stocks fell into bear market territory and the yuan currency has skidded, though there have been signs in recent days its central bank is moving to slow the currency's declines.
China's June exports rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, China General Administration of Customs reported, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll of 39 analysts, and down from a 12.6 percent gain in May. 
China's commerce ministry confirmed last month that Chinese exporters were front-loading exports to the U.S. to get ahead of expected tariffs - a situation that could exacerbate any slowdown in shipments toward the year-end. 
""Looking ahead, export growth will cool in the coming months as US tariffs start to bite alongside a broader softening in global demand,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note, though he noted a weaker yuan should help offset some of the decline.
EXPORTS, ECONOMIC RISKS
China's exports to the United States rose 13.6 percent in the first half of 2018 from a year earlier, while its imports from the U.S. rose 11.8 percent in the same period.
Separate data suggested some Chinese retailers moved up orders to the U.S. to insulate themselves from the intensifying trade war that threatens to send up costs on a growing number of consumer products.
For January-June China's trade surplus with the United States rose to $133.76 billion, compared with about $117.51 billion in the same period last year. 
After a strong start to the year, growth in China's exports has moderated recently, and is expected to face more pressure from the initial round of U.S. tariffs. Both official and private business surveys reported softer export orders last month.
China's foreign trade faces risks of slowing in the second half of the year, General Administration of Customs spokesman Huang Songping told a news conference - a view backed by analysts and likely to put more strain on an economy already feeling the pinch from a multi-year debt battle that has driven up corporate borrowing costs.
Investors fear a prolonged trade battle with the United States could harm business confidence and investment, disrupting global supply chains and harming growth in China and the rest of the world. 
South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy, warned on Thursday that components and materials used in home appliances, computers and communications devices could be caught in the crossfire of the trade war.
SEEKING TO CUSHION TRADE BLOW?
Imports grew 14.1 percent in June, customs said, missing analysts' forecast of a 20.8 percent growth, and compared with a 26 percent rise in May.
The commerce ministry also said this week it will use funds collected from tariffs charged on imports from the U.S. to help ease the impact of U.S. trade actions on Chinese companies and their employees.
In a sign Beijing is seeking alternative supplies of the commodities as it hit U.S. imports with extra tariffs, China had dropped import tariffs on a range of animal feed ingredients from several Asian countries.
Separate customs data on Friday showed imports of commodities from soybeans to crude oil eased compared with a year ago, but China's steel mills and aluminum smelters sold much more abroad spurred by higher international prices amid growing concerns about slowing demand growth.
The data could renew longstanding criticism from the United States and Europe that the world's top metal producer is selling its surplus product abroad, hurting foreign rivals. 

""We expect slowing export growth to put downward pressure on the current account and RMB (yuan), and believe China is likely to be willing to make concessions in future rounds of trade negotiations with the U.S.,"" Nomura analysts said in a note to clients.

Both exports and imports, however, likely grew at a somewhat softer rate.
Exports likely grew 7.0 percent from a year ago, the poll of 16 economists found, after rising 8.1 percent in May.
Imports probably rose 5.3 percent for the month, down from 14.0 percent in May, resulting in the trade balance swinging back into a surplus of 534.2 billion yen ($4.75 billion).
""We expect Japan's exports will continue to rise gradually as demand for capital spending is picking up globally,"" said Yosuke Yasui, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economic growth eased in the second quarter and missed forecasts, preliminary data showed on Friday, as manufacturing activity cooled and worsening U.S.-China trade tensions clouded the outlook for the trade-reliant city-state.
Gross domestic product grew 1.0 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said on Friday, slower than the median forecast of 1.2 percent in a Reuters poll of economists and the downwardly revised 1.5 percent growth in the first quarter.
""Overall, the sense is that momentum is going to continue to slow, some of it from the high base last year, some of it because electronics seems to be tapering off a little bit,"" said Selena Ling, OCBC Bank's head of treasury research and strategy.
The economy expanded 3.8 percent in April-June from a year earlier, versus the median forecast of a 4.0 percent expansion in the poll, and decelerating from the downwardly revised 4.3 percent growth posted for January-March.
Manufacturing and exports of electronics were one of Singapore's main drivers of growth last year. However, a decline in electronics shipments for six consecutive months has raised questions about overall demand in the sector.
Still, OCBC's Ling said the drivers of manufacturing had broadened slightly, thanks to contribution from the biomedical sector, which was positive.
Earlier this month, the Monetary Authority of Singapore warned risks to the global growth outlook have increased significantly thanks to the intensifying trade row and the rising prospect of a rapid acceleration in inflation.
Singapore is seen as a bellwether for global growth because international trade dwarfs its domestic economy, equating to about 200 percent of its GDP.
In May, the MTI had forecast full-year economic growth of 2.5 to 3.5 percent. GDP grew 3.6 percent rise in 2017, the fastest pace in three years.
""Going forward, downside risks to the economy will involve supply chain risks from U.S.-China trade tariffs,"" said Jeff Ng, chief economist, Asia, at Continuum Economics.
""Meanwhile, property cooling measures may also limit the upside to Singapore's near-term domestic growth,"" he added.
The city-state last week toughened curbs on the housing market, in a surprise move.
In April, the central bank tightened monetary policy for the first time in six years. Analysts are split over whether the move is the start of a longer-term tightening cycle.

Growth in Singapore’s economy, among the most trade-reliant in Asia, could ease further as an export boom moderates while risks are mounting. The nation is facing the threat of tariff wars, high oil prices, a global policy tightening cycle, and a U.S. dollar appreciation.
On the domestic front, the government’s recent tightening of property curbs may slow the recovery in consumer demand, while putting the construction sector under more pressure.
“The biggest drag continues to come from construction,” said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “We had hoped to see a bottoming out before the end of the year, but with the most recent cooling measures, especially for the private residential sector, I’m not sure if we will see the light at the end of the tunnel.”
While the impact of the U.S.-China trade conflict so far has been limited, a worsening in those relations could have severe implications for the global economy, Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, warned last week.

When accounting for calendar adjustments, the government's deficit was $26 billion compared to an adjusted deficit of $48 billion in the same month the previous year.
The deficit for the fiscal year, which began last October, was $607 billion, compared to a deficit of $523 billion in the same period of fiscal 2017. On an adjusted basis, the gap of $610 billion compared with $520 billion in the prior period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their largest increase in nearly 6-1/2 years in the year through June, while the monthly pace continued to suggest a steady buildup of inflation that could keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate increases.
Other data on Thursday showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a two-month low last week as the labor market strengthened further. The tight jobs market is supporting inflation, and import tariffs, which are set to be broadened to include consumer goods, could fan price pressures.
""U.S. inflation continues to drift gradually higher in response to a nearly fully employed economy, with some nudging from tariffs,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month on moderate gains in gasoline prices and sharp declines in the cost of apparel and hotel accommodation. The CPI rose 0.2 percent in May.
In the 12 months through June, the CPI increased 2.9 percent, the biggest rise since February 2012, after advancing 2.8 percent in May. 
With gasoline prices rising modestly and the cost of household utilities dropping in recent months, the increase in the annual inflation rate is expected to slow. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2 percent, matching May's gain. That lifted the annual increase in the so-called core CPI to 2.3 percent, the largest rise since January 2017, from 2.2 percent in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast both the CPI and core CPI rising 0.2 percent in June. 
The Fed tracks a different inflation measure, which hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in May for the first time in six years. Economists expect the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, to slightly overshoot its target.
Fed officials have indicated they would not be too concerned with inflation overshooting its target. The Fed raised interest rates in June for a second time this year and has forecast two more rate hikes before the end of 2018. 
""While we continue to expect the next hike in September, even the hawks may sound more comfortable with the current gradual tightening pace,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Prices for U.S. Treasuries were mostly flat.
LOW LAY-OFFS
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended July 7, the lowest level since early May.
That suggests robust labor market conditions prevailed in early July after the economy added 213,000 jobs in June. Steadily rising inflation, however, is eating into workers' modest wage gains. Inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings rose 0.1 percent in June following a similar gain in May.
While economists do not expect inflation to accelerate much from current levels, they cautioned that the Trump administration's protectionist trade measures could boost prices. Tariffs on lumber, aluminum and steel imports have left 
manufacturers facing rising input costs.
So far, they have not passed on those higher costs to consumers. President Donald Trump imposed the tariffs to protect domestic industries from what he says is unfair competition from foreign manufacturers. 
Last week, Trump slapped 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. On Tuesday, Trump threatened 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods.
""We do not anticipate much movement in the year-ago rate of core CPI over the next few months,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Broadening tariffs, including the possibility of consumer goods getting hit directly, create some upside risk to our inflation forecast in the second half of the year, however."" 
In June, gasoline prices rose 0.5 percent after increasing 1.7 percent in May. Food prices gained 0.2 percent, with food consumed at home rebounding 0.2 percent after falling 0.2 percent in May. Food prices were unchanged in May.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing by the same margin in May. But the cost of hotel accommodations fell a record 4.1 percent. 
Healthcare costs advanced 0.4 percent, with the price of hospital services surging 0.8 percent. Healthcare prices gained 0.2 percent in May, and consumers also paid more for prescription medication last month.
Prices for new motor vehicles rose for a second straight month. There were also increases in the cost of communication, motor vehicle insurance, education and alcoholic beverages.

But apparel prices fell 0.9 percent after being unchanged in May. The cost of airline tickets declined for a third straight month, while prices of household furnishings and tobacco also dropped last month.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Thursday cut its forecasts for the euro zone's economic growth this year, citing among the top causes for its revision trade tensions with the United States and rising oil prices which push the bloc's inflation higher.
The slowdown of the euro zone economy is set to affect all major economies of the bloc, but is expected to hit Italy harder, as the country will record the lowest growth rate in Europe, matched only by Britain among all 28 EU countries.
The EU executive estimated the 19-country euro zone will grow by 2.1 percent this year, lower than the 2.3 percent gross domestic product (GDP) increase it had forecast in its previous estimates released in May, and further below the 2.4 percent growth recorded last year. 
In 2019 the bloc's growth should further slow to 2.0 percent, unchanged from the previous forecast. More information on this chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JRXh7h 
""The downward revision of GDP growth since May shows that an unfavorable external environment, such as growing trade tensions with the U.S., can dampen confidence and take a toll on economic expansion,"" EU commission's vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said.
The negative impact of trade disputes on the European and global economy are expected to be much bigger in case of escalation, the EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici said.
""Trade wars produce no winners, only casualties,"" he stressed.
Rising oil prices have also contributed to the slowdown, the commission said, and are expected to push euro zone's inflation up to 1.7 percent this year and next, from the previously estimated 1.5 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019.
UK, ITALY BLUES
Germany and France, the two largest economies of the euro zone, are expected to lose steam this year and next.
Germany's GDP expansion will slow to 1.9 percent this year and in 2019 from the previously estimated 2.3 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019. It grew 2.2 percent last year.
France's economy will grow 1.7 percent this year and next, much below the 2.2 percent growth it experienced last year. The new estimates are also less optimistic than the 2.0 percent growth the Commission had earlier forecast for this year and also slower than the 1.8 percent growth previously forecast for 2019.
The slowest-growing economy of the bloc will remain Italy which is expected to grow only 1.3 percent this year, less than the 1.5 percent estimated in May. The economy will further slow to 1.1 percent in 2019, farther down from the 1.5 percent growth recorded last year.
One of the causes cited by the Commission for the revision were ""re-emerging concerns or uncertainty about economic policies"", as Italy's new eurosceptic government has launched ambiguous messages on its future spending plans.
Only Britain is expected to match Italy's sluggish growth among all the 28 states of the European Union. It will grow 1.3 percent this year, according to the Commission, less than the previously estimated 1.5 percent expansion - a big drop from the 1.7 percent GDP rise recorded last year.
In 2019, when Britain is expected to quit the European Union, its economic expansion should slow further to 1.2 percent, the commission predicted. 
It stressed however next year's forecast was based on technical assumptions as the unclear outcome of Brexit talks could have unpredictable effects on the country's economy.

Britain's inflation is also forecast to go up further to 2.6 percent this year, from a previous estimate of 2.5 percent.

""It was felt that the open-ended character of the state-contingent component (of the guidance) should be emphasized, with policy rates expected to remain at their present levels for as long as necessary to ensure... a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation,"" the ECB said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank held its base rate steady on Thursday, as expected, but one board member's dissenting vote may have raised the odds of a rate hike in coming months as major peers tighten monetary policy.
A downturn in South Korea's labor market and feeble price growth have added to policymakers' concerns over the extent of recovery in Asia's fourth largest economy.
Governor Lee Ju-yeol told a news conference it was difficult to see Thursday's sole dissenting vote as a signal for future rate hikes.
But news of the dissenting vote sent September futures on three-year treasury bonds 0.19 points lower to 108.10 as of 0443 GMT, as many market participants saw it as forward guidance to the bank's next move.
The yield on 3-year government bonds rose to 2.088 percent after closing on Wednesday at a 2018-low of 2.054 percent.
Lee Il-houng, a distinguished economist and Thursday's sole dissenter on the seven-member board, voted to raise rates. He similarly went against the majority at a meeting in October 2017 to vote for a rate rise, which was then promptly agreed in November - the BOK's first hike in six years.
""The chances of a rate hike are higher now,"" said Shin Eol, an economist at Shinhan Investment Corporation. ""We definitely have some mixed signals here so there are uncertainties about timing,"" Shin said, noting that the U.S.-China trade war could be a 'game changer' and further delay any hikes.
In a mixed signal, the central bank downgraded its growth outlook to 2.9 percent for this year from 3.0 percent previously.
""Although the outlook for this year has been revised down to 2.9 percent, we still see (the economy) growing at its potential rate,"" Governor Lee Ju-yeol said after holding the bank's 7-day repurchase rate <KROCRT=ECI> at 1.50 percent for a fifth straight monetary meeting.
""The growth and inflation trajectories aren't all that different from paths seen in April,"" Lee said.
Momentum for achieving the BOK's target of 3 percent growth this year appeared to wane after an export boom ground to a halt in June in the face of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.
Statements issued after the rate decision showed policymakers were concerned about South Korea's lack of job growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute, which is raising fears of collateral damage to other export-reliant Asian economies.
The monthly average of 142,000 jobs added between January and June this year is the slowest growth seen since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, according to Statistics Korea.
Still, the bank said it expected exports to ""sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy"".
Even with difficult domestic conditions, a majority of analysts see the central bank raising its benchmark rate in the second half to curb potential capital outflows as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to raise its rates.
""I see a hike in November, after midterm elections in the United States,"" said Kong Dong-rak, an economist at Daishin Securities. ""(Dissenter) Lee says its time to get rid of the accommodative stance, so it's hard to say the chance of a rate hike this year is gone.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in June amid gains in the cost of services and motor vehicles, leading to the biggest annual increase in 6-1/2 years.
The report published by the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed a pickup in underlying producer inflation last month. Economists expect tariffs on lumber, steel and aluminum imports to drive up prices, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates two more times this year.
""With underlying inflationary pressures building even before the tariffs, we suspect the Fed will be forced to continue raising rates once a quarter,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
The producer price index for final demand climbed 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in May. That pushed the annual increase in the PPI to 3.4 percent, the largest rise since November 2011, from 3.1 percent in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.2 percent in June and increasing 3.2 percent year-on-year. 
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.3 percent last month. The so-called core PPI edged up 0.1 percent in May. 
In the 12 months through June, the core PPI advanced 2.7 percent after increasing 2.6 percent in May. 
There were gains in the cost of materials used in manufacturing and construction, a sign that the duties on steel and aluminum imports were raising prices. 
President Donald Trump imposed the tariffs to protect domestic industries from what he says is unfair competition from foreign manufacturers. Major trade partners, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico have retaliated with tariffs of their own.
Last week, the Trump administration slapped 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, eliciting a similar response from Beijing. On Tuesday, Trump threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
Prices for softwood lumber, iron and steel mill products as well as nonferrous metal products increased in June.
""Since the PPI covers the price of domestically produced goods, these gains represent U.S. producers raising prices behind the tariff wall or the impact of higher input costs,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""We expect these price pressures will flow through into higher core inflation at the consumer level as the year unfolds.""
RISING INPUT COSTS
Manufacturers have been facing a rise in the cost of inputs, but so far have not passed on the increases to consumers. Inflation is steadily rising against the backdrop of a labor market that is viewed as being near or at full employment. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in May for the first time in six years. The Fed raised interest rates in June for the second time this year and has forecast two more rate hikes by the end of 2018. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. U.S. stocks were trading lower while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
In June, the cost of services increased 0.4 percent after climbing 0.3 percent in May. A 21.8 percent jump in the index for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for about 40 percent of the rise in the cost of services.
The cost of healthcare services rose 0.2 percent as a 1.0 percent surge in prices for hospital outpatient care offset slight declines in the cost of doctor visits and hospital inpatient care. Healthcare prices nudged up 0.1 percent in May. 
Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index. 
There were also increases in the cost of transporting goods by road, likely reflecting an acute shortage of truck drivers. Truck transportation prices soared a record 1.3 percent in June.
But wholesale prices of apparel and footwear fell as did the cost of airline tickets.
Prices for goods edged up 0.1 percent last month after surging 1.0 percent in May. They were last month restrained by a 1.1 percent drop in food prices. Wholesale gasoline prices rose 0.5 percent after jumping 9.8 percent in May.

Excluding foods and energy, goods prices climbed 0.3 percent, rising by the same margin for a sixth consecutive month. Motor vehicle prices increased 0.4 percent in June, the biggest gain in seven months.

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on homeowners' requests for refinancing fell 3.8 percent to 958.5 in the week ended July 6. This was the lowest weekly reading since December 2000. 
Refinancing's share of weekly mortgage activity fell to its lowest since August 2008 at 34.8 percent of total applications. This compared with 37.2 percent the previous week, MBA said. 
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" home loans, whose balances are $453,100 or less, averaged 4.76 percent from 4.79 percent the week before, it said. 
However, the average rate on 30-year loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, which are often used by first-time home buyers or borrowers with patchy credit, rose to 4.80 percent from 4.78 percent the prior week.
Interest rates on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 4.13 percent, the highest level since MBA began tracking this type of loans in January 2011.
Thirty-year mortgage rates generally fell in step with longer-dated U.S. bond yields last week, while adjustable-rate loan rates declined with higher shorter-dated bond yields. 
Meanwhile, the MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on loan applications to buy a home, a proxy on future housing activity, increased 6.5 percent last week to 261.5. This was its strongest weekly level since the week of April 20.
The group's seasonally adjusted barometer on total mortgage applications gained 2.5 percent to 372.6 last week.

The Labor Department said its producer price index increased 0.3% last month. In the 12 months through June, the PPI rose 3.4%.
Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.2% last month and increasing 3.2% from a year ago.
The so-called core PPI increased by 0.3% from a month earlier and rose 2.8% in the 12 months through June.
Analysts had predicted core PPI to increase 0.2% month-on-month and 2.6% on an annualized basis.
Core PPI is a key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs.
The Federal Reserve keeps its eye on this data because when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation."
1457,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 09:52PM ET</span>",Japan machinery orders seen as bullish after May's smaller than expected fall,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders fell in May, pulling back from the previous month's big gain, although the decline was softer than expected, easing some concerns about a slowdown in capital expenditure amid a worsening U.S.-China trade conflict.
Capital expenditure is a bright spot in Japan's economy, which suffered a first-quarter contraction after its longest growth run since the bubble economy of the 1980s.Economists are watching capital spending closely for clues on the strength of an expected economic rebound in the second quarter.
Cabinet Office data out on Wednesday showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 3.7 percent, smaller than economists' median estimate of a 5.5 percent drop.
It followed a 10.1 percent rise in April.
The data came a week after the Bank of Japan's key tankan survey showed big firms planned to raise capital spending by a solid 13.6 percent this fiscal year, even as manufacturers' business confidence soured for two straight quarters in June.
""The orders data as well as the tankan confirmed bullish capital expenditure,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""Core orders look set to grow for a fourth straight quarter in April-June."" Economists expect capital expenditure to be underpinned by the need to upgrade production capacity, boost software, invest in labor-saving equipment to cope with labor shortages and to meet infrastructure needs ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
Still, policymakers and analysts are carefully watching how trade disputes between the United States and China - Japan's two major export destinations - may affect corporate capital spending plans in an export-reliant economy. 
U.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports took effect on Friday. Beijing responded with its own measures.
The Trump administration raised the stakes in its trade war with China on Tuesday, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
By sector, orders from manufacturers rose 1.3 percent in May, while service-sector orders increased 0.2 percent.
The Cabinet Office kept its assessment of machinery orders unchanged to say they are picking up.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electricity utilities, rose 16.5 percent in May, versus an 8.6 percent gain seen by economists.
The Bank of Japan's June tankan showed big manufacturers planned to increase capital expenditure by 17.9 percent this fiscal year, the fastest gain since 2015.
Large non-manufacturers plan to raise capex by 11.2 percent, which would be the fastest increase since 1990 at the peak of the bubble economy.

The central bank will scrutinize the orders and other data at its rate review ending July 31, at which its nine-member board will conduct a quarterly review of its long-term growth and inflation outlook.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 12:59PM ET</span>",U.S. job quits rate hits 17-year high; labor market tightening,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More American workers voluntarily quit their jobs in May, government data showed on Tuesday, a sign of confidence in the labor market that economists say will soon boost wage growth.
In its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, the Labor Department said the number of workers leaving jobs of their own free will increased 212,000 to 3.3 million.
That lifted the quits rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 2.4 percent, the highest since April 2001.
The rise in the quits rate, which policymakers and economists view as a measure of job market confidence, bolsters expectations that wage gains will accelerate this year.
""Workers can hope to get the best bump in wages when they switch jobs,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""As workers seek to improve their lot by taking better positions they open up positions for others to climb up as well.""
Wage inflation has remained moderate despite tightening labor market conditions. Annual wage growth as measured by average hourly earnings has struggled to break 3 percent, increasing 2.7 percent in June.
Labor market strength and steadily rising inflation likely keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates again in August. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in June for a second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes by the end of 2018.
Workers voluntarily quitting their jobs in May were concentrated in the health care and social assistance, finance and insurance, utilities, transportation and warehousing industries.
The JOLTS report also showed there were 6.6 million unfilled jobs at the end of May, down from the record 6.8 million vacancies reported in April. Job openings remain elevated and continue to suggest a shortage of skilled workers, with the labor market seen as being either near or at full employment.
The decline in job openings came as hiring increased by 173,000 to 5.8 million in May. The hires rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.9 percent, the highest since March 2007. There was a job for every unemployed person seeking one in May.
""The decline in job openings appears to be related to stronger hiring, but it may also reflect businesses lowering their hiring standards,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
An NFIB survey published on Tuesday showed small businesses reporting the shortage of qualified workers as the main problem affecting their operations in June.
The JOLTS report showed there were 10,000 additional vacancies in the mining and logging industry in May. The federal government had 12,000 more job openings. But unfilled jobs in the information sector fell by 60,000 and vacancies in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry declined by 27,000.
The Labor Department also said it had identified errors in the JOLTS data for the federal government from January 2011 to April 2018. It said these data had been ""suppressed"" from the database and would be reissued.

Some 3.56 million workers left positions in May, the most in data back to 2000, and up from the prior month’s 3.35 million, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. That pushed up the quits rate, which measures quitters as a share of employed people, to a 17-year high of 2.4 percent from 2.3 percent. With more workers feeling assured of finding better employment, sustained wage gains may soon follow.
The latest jump is sure to be closely watched by Federal Reserve policy makers as they monitor for signs of upward pressure on worker pay that may feed overall inflation. In another bullish sign, the gap between vacancies and the number of unemployed widened to 573,000 in May, a sign there’s potentially work available for every jobless person in America."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain' economy picked up a bit of speed in May after slowing in early 2018, according to official figures that are likely to give the Bank of England more confidence about raising interest rates next month.
A new monthly reading of gross domestic product showed the world's fifth-biggest economy grew by 0.3 percent in May from April.
That was up from growth of 0.2 percent in April and in line with the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, marking the strongest growth since November, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
Sterling fell against the dollar after the data, which showed a mixed picture of the economy. Growth came mostly from the dominant services sector while factory output disappointed.
But Cathal Kennedy, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the figures should support expectations that the BoE would raise rates in August. 
""The gradual momentum into May really backs up what the Bank has been saying of late. We have seen a bounceback from the first quarter,"" he said.
BoE Governor Mark Carney and other top officials at the central bank opted not to raise rates in May because of the early 2018 slowdown. 
Instead, they decided to wait for signs the weakness was temporary and caused by unusually cold winter weather rather than a sign of broader problems before Britain's exit from the European Union next year.
However, upheaval in the government of Prime Minister Theresa May -- battling to keep her grip on the ruling Conservative Party, which is split over Brexit -- could yet affect confidence among employers, a potential new hurdle for the BoE. 
Britain' economy grew by 0.2 percent in the three months to May, as expected, after stagnating in the three months to April.
In annual terms, the economy was 1.5 percent bigger than in May last year, the ONS said.
The BoE' rate-setting committee is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent -- only its second rate increase in more than a decade -- on Aug. 2, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
SERVICES-LED GROWTH
The ONS said the warm weather and spending around the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle helped the economy.
Britain’s services industry grew 0.3 percent month-on-month in May, slowing from an upwardly revised 0.4 percent in April.
Over the three months to May, growth in services -- which makes up 80 percent of economic output -- picked up speed to 0.4 percent from 0.2 percent.
But industrial output fell unexpectedly in May by 0.4 percent on the month, hit by the shutdown of the Sullom Voe oil and gas terminal.
Manufacturing growth also disappointed, rising only 0.4 percent on the month -- less than half the growth rate expected in the Reuters poll. 
May capped the weakest three months for British factories since December 2012.
There was better news from construction, which had struggled in the bad weather of early 2018. Output jumped 2.9 percent in May, far exceeding expectations and marking the first growth in the sector since December.
Separate data showed Britain's deficit in goods trade during May was broadly unchanged from April at 12.362 billion pounds ($16.37 billion).

The Office of National Statistics said the economy grew 0.3% month-on-month in May, recovering from a sharp slowdown at the start of the year, where growth was just 0.2% in the three months to March.
The rolling three-month estimate showed that the economy grew 0.2% in the three months to May, reflecting the slower growth from the earlier months.
The ONS said the report painted a mixed picture of the economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output.
The service industries expanded 0.4% in the three months to May, the largest contributor to GDP growth, but contraction in the production and construction industries meant that they each had negative contributions to GDP.
""Retailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May while housebuilding and manufacturing both contracted,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
“Services, in particular, grew robustly in May with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months.""
It is the first time that the ONS released monthly economic growth figures and a rolling three-month figure, instead of a quarterly figure.
Under the new model, the GDP report will contain a significantly higher amount of data and allow for quicker estimates of growth, but it will be volatile and subject to revision.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer inflation accelerated to a six-month high in June, lifted by strong commodity prices and threatening to put more pressure on the country's exporters as a trade war escalates between Washington and Beijing.
Annual consumer inflation also edged up as food prices rose at a faster pace, official data showed on Tuesday. But retail price pressures remain modest, allowing the central bank to remain more focused on ways to support the slowing economy.
The United States and China slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others' goods last week, fuelling fears of a prolonged battle that would hurt global investment and growth, damage U.S. farm exports and potentially drive up food prices in China.
The producer price index (PPI) -- a gauge of industrial profitability -- rose by a stronger-than-expected 4.7 percent in June from a year earlier, compared with a 4.1 percent increase in May, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
China's producer inflation has now picked up for three months in a row after easing in late 2017, though month-on-month growth dipped to 0.3 percent in June.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected June producer inflation would pick up to 4.5 percent, buoyed by a recent recovery in global commodity prices.
June's price gains were driven by increases in oil and gas production, coal mining, metals and chemicals processing and manufacturing sectors.
With oil prices up, China on Monday raised retail gasoline prices by the most since December 2016.
The higher prices have helped fuel a jump in earnings, with profits at China's industrial firms growing at a sizzling pace in May, but some analysts say the latest gains would have less of an impact on profits.
""Unlike the broad based pick-up in PPI last year, the recent rebound has been more narrowly driven by oil prices and so is less supportive of corporate profits,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
The jump in prices of resources such as oil and steel has benefited producers but raised input costs for manufacturers like exporters which are further along supply chains. Business surveys show Chinese manufacturers are already reporting softer export orders as the trade row deepens.
FEW SIGNS OF TARIFF IMPACT FOR CONSUMERS YET
There are few signs in official data that tariff jitters are percolating through to most Chinese consumers just yet.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent in June from a year earlier, in line with expectations for a slight pick-up from May's gain of 1.8 percent. On a month-on-month basis, the CPI fell 0.1 percent.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was unchanged at 1.9 percent in June.
 The food price index rose 0.3 percent from a year earlier, after ticking up 0.1 percent in May. Non-food prices rose 2.2 percent, compared with 2.2 percent growth a month earlier.
Still, investors are closely watching for signs of any upward price pressure from American retail goods hit by higher Chinese duties, ranging from pet food to mixed nuts and whiskey.
German automaker BMW (DE:BMWG) said on Friday that it will have to raise prices on U.S.-made models that are imported by China.
Tesla (O:TSLA) has raised prices on its Model X and S models sold in China by more than $20,000, automotive news website Electrek reported on Monday.
But analysts believe retail price rises will likely be limited, capped by higher borrowing costs and waning domestic demand.
""We believe the government is likely to introduce special measures such as returning the charged 25 percent tariffs on some agricultural products to importers,"" economists at Nomura said in a note.
China has set an inflation goal of 3 percent for 2018, the same as last year.
Some analysts think a shift in monetary policy towards loosening is already underway.
The central bank pumped more cash into the economy by cutting reserve requirements for banks this month, and regulators have told lenders to lower borrowing costs for smaller companies.
""We still think that a broader easing of price pressures on the back of slower domestic activity will help keep inflation subdued, giving the People’s Bank ample room to further loosen monetary policy in the coming months,"" wrote Evans-Pritchard.

Total retail sales values rose by 2.3 percent compared with June 2017, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.
That was the joint second-biggest increase of 2018 after a winter slowdown, but was weaker than a 4.1 percent jump in May as the excitement around England's progress in the World Cup boosted sales only for specific goods.
""The reality is that sales don't grow on the feel-good factor alone,"" Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said.
""With household incomes still barely growing faster than inflation, conditions for consumers and retailers remain extremely tough."" 
Consumer spending accounts for around 80 percent of Britain's economy and the Bank of England is watching closely for how shoppers are behaving as it weighs up whether to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in August.
The BRC said that in like-for-like terms, which takes into account changes in shop floor space, sales rose 1.1 percent, again slower than May's increase of 2.8 percent.
Separately, Barclaycard, the credit and debit card division of  Barclays  (L:BARC), said its measure of consumer spending -- which includes bars and restaurants -- rose by 5.1 percent, matching May's increase which was the strongest in over a year.
Spending in pubs and restaurants jumped by nearly 10 percent in June, Barclaycard said, but supermarket spending edged up only 0.8 percent, its weakest growth in 15 months. That slowdown might reflect the impact of a 9.3 percent surge in spending on fuel on the back of higher global oil prices.

Shoppers in Britain remained cautious with four in 10 saying they will hold off on buying big-ticket items until the economy seems more settled, Barclaycard said.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 03:52PM ET</span>","U.S. job growth underscores economy's strength, tariffs a threat","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in June, but steady wage gains pointed to moderate inflation pressures that should keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate increases this year.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 213,000 jobs last month as manufacturers stepped up hiring, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy added 37,000 more jobs in April and May than previously reported. It needs to create about 120,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
""Overall the report is good news insofar as it suggests the economy still has some capacity to grow at an above-trend pace without generating much inflationary pressure,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Similarly, it should ease the concerns of the hawks (at the Fed) who worry that the Fed's rate hike campaign is behind the curve."" 
The report showed strength in the economy before a trade war started between the United States and China, which analysts warned could slow hiring, especially in the manufacturing sector. The U.S. and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of the other's imports on Friday.
Washington is also engaged in fights with other major trade partners, including Canada, Mexico and the European Union after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump argues that the duties are necessary to protect domestic industries from what he says is unfair competition from foreign manufacturers. 
Economists have warned the tit-for-tat tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, undermine business investment and raise prices for consumers, and wipe out the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package that came into effect in January. 
The unemployment rate rose to 4.0 percent in June from an 18-year low of 3.8 percent in May as 601,000 job seekers entered the labor force in a sign of confidence in the labor market. That was the first increase in the jobless rate in 10 months.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 62.9 percent last month from 62.7 percent in May. It had declined for three straight months.
Average hourly earnings gained five cents, or 0.2 percent in June after increasing 0.3 percent in May. That kept the annual increase in average hourly earnings at 2.7 percent. But with a record 6.7 million unfilled jobs in April, economists are confident that wage growth will accelerate later this year. 
June's moderate wage growth should, for now, allay fears of the economy overheating. The Fed's preferred inflation measure hit the central bank's 2 percent target in May for the first time in six years. Economists expect inflation will hover around its target because of labor market tightness.
""Wages could rise at a faster pace in the future as the economy is humming and the labor market is tight,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics in Los Angeles. ""However, the ongoing trade war with China and our allies could hurt investment spending and hold back job and wage gains.""
The dollar fell to a three-week low against a basket of currencies on the employment report. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes touching two-week highs.
ROBUST ECONOMY
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 195,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate steady at 3.8 percent. 
Minutes of the Fed's June 12-13 policy meeting published on Thursday were upbeat on the labor market. The U.S. central bank raised interest rates last month for the second time this year and has projected two more rate hikes by year end.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose to 7.8 percent last month from a 17-year low of 7.6 percent in May. 
The employment report together with data from the Commerce Department showing the trade deficit narrowed 6.6 percent to a 1-1/2-year low of $43.1 billion in May reinforced expectations of robust economic growth in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the April-June period are as high as a 5 percent annualized rate, more than double the 2.0 percent pace logged in the first quarter. 
But the Trump administration's ""America First"" trade policy, is casting a pall over the outlook for the rest of the year and into 2019. Manufacturing, construction and other sectors heavily reliant on trade are seen taking a big hit from the tariff wars.
""Fortunately the economy has a good head of steam going into a period of significant uncertainty in terms of the impact of higher tariffs across a broad range of imports and exports,"" said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Alpha Economic Foresights in Boston. ""Unequivocally, this is a nightmare situation.""
Manufacturers hired 36,000 workers in June, the most in six months, adding to the 19,000 jobs created in May. The factory jobs were concentrated in the automobile industry, which had seen a decline in employment in May after a fire at a major parts supplier disrupted production.
Construction payrolls rose by 13,000 last month after increasing by 29,000 jobs in May. There were gains in professional and business services employment as well as leisure and hospitality. But retailers cut 21,600 jobs last month, after boosting payrolls by 25,100 in May. 

Government payrolls increased by 11,000 jobs in June, buoyed by local government hiring.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap narrowed 6.6 percent to $43.1 billion, the smallest since October 2016. Data for April was slightly revised to show the trade deficit falling to $46.1 billion, instead of the previously reported $46.2 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit declining to $43.7 billion in May. When adjusted for inflation, the trade gap narrowed to $75.3 billion, the lowest level since March 2017, from $77.5 billion in April. The so-called real trade deficit in April and May was below its $82.5 billion average in the first quarter.
The drop in the real trade deficit in April and May suggests trade could contribute to gross domestic product in the second quarter after having a neutral impact in the January-March period. Estimates for second-quarter GDP are above a 4.0 percent annualized rate, which is double the 2.0 percent growth pace logged in the first three months of the year.
But tensions between the United States and its major trading partners, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico are clouding the outlook for the rest of the year.

The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China surged 18.7 percent to $33.2 billion in May. The deficit with Mexico jumped 18.8 percent. 
In May, exports of goods and services rose 1.9 percent to a record $215.3 billion. Exports were boosted by a $1.9 billion increase in deliveries of commercial aircraft. Soybean exports increased 2.0 billion. Imports of goods and services rose 0.4 percent to $258.4 billion in May.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output bounced back in May, data showed on Friday, suggesting that factories in Europe's largest economy are gathering steam again after a weak start of the year.
Data from the Statistics Office showed output increased by 2.6 percent, the highest rise since November. The reading beat a Reuters forecast for a rise of 0.3 percent and was only the second rise so far this year.
The figure for April was revised to a fall of 1.3 percent from a previously reported fall of 1.0 percent.
The ministry put down the fall in April to holidays.
""The combination of a healthy backlog as well as a comprehensive level orders in May signal that the development in the manufacturing sector remains modestly positive,"" it said in a statement.
On Wednesday data showed that industrial orders had surged by 2.6 percent in May after four consecutive monthly drops.
RAY OF LIGHT
The recent figures dispel concerns about growth in Europe's largest economy and support expectations that a consumption-driven upswing will continue this year albeit at a slower pace than last year when the economy expanded by 2.5 percent.
""May’s industrial data add to the evidence that the weakness in the sector earlier in the year was at least partly down to temporary factors,"" Jack Allen of Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.
Cold weather, a flu outbreak and holidays were named as the main source for the weak data in the first four months of the year.
This coincided with fears that restrictive trade measures championed by the U.S. President Donald Trump were clouding the outlook for the German economy, whose export sector relies on free trade for growth. 
""Overall, economic growth in Germany and the wider euro-zone has clearly slowed since last year, but we think that it will remain fairly strong,"" he added.
A breakdown of the output data showed that activity in the consumer goods and construction sectors was most vibrant.
Carsten Brzeski of ING DiBa said the positive data bodes well for the growth prospects in the second half of the year.
""After a long period of disappointments, this week finally brought some rays of light to the German economy,"" he wrote in a note. ""It increasingly looks as if the economy is in a transition toward more normal growth rates.""

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 03:43PM ET</span>",Fed on lookout for recession but still sees strong economy: minutes,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. central bankers discussed whether recession lurked around the corner and expressed concerns global trade tensions could hit an economy that by most measures looked strong, minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting on June 12-13 released on Thursday showed.
The minutes, which described a meeting in which the Fed raised interest rates for the second time this year, also suggested policymakers might soon signal that the Fed's rate-hiking cycle was advanced enough that policy was no longer boosting or constraining the economy.
The minutes overall gave the impression of a central bank impressed by the U.S. economy's strength and confident in its plans to continue raising rates, but also concerned with what could push the economy off its upward course.
""Most (Fed policymakers) noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects,"" according to the minutes.
Many of the Fed's contacts across the economy said they were worried that a recent increase in tariffs levied by the United States and its trading partners was weighing on investment, according to the minutes' summary of policymaker discussions.
""The trade threat is the prime risk factor so Fed officials are going to monitor how it affects business,"" said Putri Pascualy, a portfolio manager at Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co in Irvine, California.
Fed policymakers also had a wide-ranging discussion on whether the recently slim spread between short- and long-term interest rates might be a sign of an impending recession.
""A number of participants thought it would be important to continue to monitor the slope of the yield curve,"" according to the minutes.
U.S. stock prices pared earlier gains, which had been fed by optimism over reports of a possible cooling in the U.S-European Union row on car tariffs. The U.S. dollar extended losses against a basket of currencies. 
At the meeting, policymakers also discussed a special presentation by Fed staff on another potential indicator of recession: the spread between the Fed's current policy rate and the expected rate several quarters ahead derived from futures markets.
That indicator might have more reliable information than the yield curve, which might be distorted by temporary factors, the staff said, according to the minutes.
The document released on Thursday did not indicate whether policymakers took either the yield curve or the information from the staff presentation as pointing toward an impending recession.
Policymakers generally agreed recent economic data showed a strong economy that was evolving in line with their expectations.

However, they also discussed a number of global factors potentially weighing on the economy or its outlook, including ""political and economic developments in Europe and some (emerging market economies).""

""Participants generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with solid expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" the Fed said in the minutes.
The Fed's case to continue tightening monetary policy was strengthened by a continued uptick in inflation and a solid labor market, despite concerns about the impact of rising trade tensions on spending and business sentiment.
""Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,"" the Fed said.
The minutes also showed that Fed policymakers expected that ""inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis.""
The Fed's recent addition of ""symmetric"" to its language concerning the inflation target is widely viewed as a signal that central bank policymakers are comfortable with inflation running above its target.
Ahead of the crucial nonfarm payrolls report due Friday, the Fed minutes showed that policymakers continued to expect the labor market conditions to strengthen, supporting a further decline in the unemployment rate.
""Participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or decline further below, their estimates of its longer-run normal rate,"" the Fed's minutes showed.
Stocks took a sell-the-news stance towards the minutes. The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all fell after the release of the minutes at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT). But buyers soon returned, pushing the indices closer to the gains seen before the mintues were published.
The release of minutes comes after the Fed, as was widely expected, raised interest rates by a quarter point at its June 12-13 policy meeting and lifted its projection for the number of rate hikes in 2018 up to four from three previously, though the move was driven by just one policymaker changing their projection.
It was the seventh rate hike since late 2015, when the Fed first started to raise interest rates from near zero.
Traders are currently pricing in a 76% chance of a rate hike in September, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a fourth rate hike by December are seen at about 48%."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity picked up in June amid strong growth in new orders, but trade tariffs and a shortage of workers were starting to strain the supply chain, which could slow momentum in the coming months.
While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten.
The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index rose 0.5 point to 59.1 last month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The survey's new orders index jumped 2.7 points to 63.2, but a measure of backlog orders fell 4.0 points to 56.5. A gauge of prices paid by services industries for inputs fell 3.6 points last month. 
The ISM said while service industries continued to be optimistic about business conditions and the overall economy, ""there is a continuing concern relating to tariffs, capacity constraints and delivery."" Similar complaints have also been echoed by manufacturers.
The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on a range of imported goods, including steel and aluminum, to protect domestic industries from what it says is unfair competition from foreign manufacturers. Major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, have retaliated with their own tariffs, raising the specter of a trade war. 
Economists have warned the import tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, undermine business investment and raise prices for consumers, and wipe out the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package that came into effect in January.
""As with the manufacturing report released on Tuesday, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence that tariffs were beginning to have an impact, but with the prices balance falling in June and new export orders rising, there is little sign that this is affecting the economy yet,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGE
Services industries also complained about difficulties finding qualified workers, especially truck drivers, which some said was ""getting worse each month."" There are a record 6.7 million unfilled jobs.
The ISM survey's measure of service industry employment slipped in June, but continued to show growth. Some industries said they ""need to hire more people,"" and others noted that ""employee retention is getting much more competitive."" 
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 177,000 workers in June, less than market expectations for a 190,000 gain. Private payrolls increased by 189,000 jobs in May.
While the ADP report is generally not seen as a good predictor of the government's closely watched employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, it supported expectations of some cooling in job growth in June after May's robust gains. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 195,000 jobs last month, adding to the 223,000 positions created in May.
The dollar fell to a three-week low against a basket of currencies while prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose slightly. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ended June 30. It was the second straight weekly increase in jobless claims. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 225,000 in the latest week. Some economists blamed the rise in claims on automobile manufacturers shutting down assembly lines for annual retooling. 
""We had been expecting a move up like this because we thought that temporary auto plant shutdowns would lead to more initial claims filings during the week ending June 30 than normal for comparable weeks in recent years,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
""We think that the temporary plant closures, which usually are on and off for about a month in the weeks around July 4, are likely generating noise in the claims data now, so we do not think that the increase in claims over the past two weeks is an especially negative sign for the labor market.""

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 224,500 last week.

The four-week moving average was 224,500, up 2,250 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended June 23 rose to 1.739 million from 1.707 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an increase to 1.720 million.

His company, which sells sauvignon blancs and zinfandels to distributors in China has lost a half-million dollars in orders since China slapped tariffs in April on $3 billion worth of U.S. fruits, nuts and wine.
A much larger group of U.S. companies and traders selling American goods in China is bracing for a similar blow as the world's second-largest economy prepares to impose tariffs on another $34 billion of American imports on Friday.

He added that Chinese buyers, worried about costs, started to cancel orders on April 2, the day the first round of tariffs kicked in. 
""Everyone is holding off to see what happens with this tax, whether it's repealed, or if there's a better solution. Overall it's hurt our business,"" Chen said.
China's next round of tariffs focuses on American-made consumer products. The overall value mirrors U.S. tariffs, which also are set to kick in on Friday.
The escalating exchange of tariffs could mark the start of a larger, destabilizing trade war if Washington and Beijing cannot resolve their differences, including concerns in the United States about unfair Chinese trade practices.
President Donald Trump's administration has threatened successive waves of duties on up to $450 billion in Chinese imports. China has said it will not back down, although it has fewer U.S. imports to target.
""If the United States decides to escalate these tensions, everyone is going to get caught up, and it's going to be pain across the board,"" said Nick Marro, Hong Kong-based analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.
'POLITICAL DANCE'
American businesses and industry lobbies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have criticized Trump's trade dispute with China, saying it will hurt businesses that already face greater competition from local rivals.
Richard Morgan, chief executive of business advisory Equus Global Associates and a distributor of California dairy and Georgia pecans in China, told Reuters he was absorbing the impact of the April tariffs, reducing his profit margin to preserve market share and keep customers.
""We've just got to hang on,"" he said. ""The sad part for us is while this political dance is playing out, our business may be taking a hit. But hopefully it'll blow over quickly.""
U.S. producers of pork, fruit and nuts - on both the April and July lists - may be hit the hardest, with pork now facing cumulative import duties of 71 percent. At least one pork producer has said it could be put out of business.
Chinese retailers told Reuters they probably would raise prices or spurn U.S. imports for domestic substitutes, which could eventually hurt their businesses. 
""If these tariffs are added, then we will definitely have to adjust (our prices) a little,"" said Zhao Yanmei, an assistant manager at a branch of Jenny Lou's international supermarket chain in northeast Beijing. ""If customers feel that the prices are very high after the adjustments, then sales will go down.""
Gao Han, a salesman at Beijing Chaoxing Seafood Company, which sells U.S. lobsters, said that his firm was stocking up before the tariffs hit, but that if the issue persisted they'd have to raises prices or shift supply.
""There's nothing we can do if there's a trade war,"" Gao said as he showed off the firm's imported lobsters amid tanks of seafood at its Beijing store. ""All we can do is adjust our supply chain here depending on the size of the price increases.""
How much consumers are willing change their behavior because of the tariffs will shape which businesses suffer most.
""If prices rise, I will look for alternatives to imported U.S. fruits and food products,"" said Zheng Yuxi, a 26-year-old publicist in Shanghai. ""I can buy home-grown apricot kernels instead. As for fruits that are not widely grown in China like blueberries, I can simply opt for other fruits.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders bounced back in May with a stronger-than-expected jump after four consecutive monthly drops, data showed on Thursday, as demand from domestic customers and the rest of the euro zone picked up.
The Federal Statistics Office said orders rose 2.6 percent after an upwardly revised drop of 1.6 percent the previous month. The latest reading beat a Reuters poll of analysts, who had predicted a 1.1 percent rise.
""The upswing is alive, but it has passed its peak,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, pointing to external risks such as protectionist moves by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Economy Ministry said industrial output was likely to rise moderately in coming months.
The rise in May was mainly driven by demand from other euro zone countries and domestic clients. A breakdown of the figures showed that orders for capital goods and consumer goods jumped the most.
The ministry said the four monthly drops from January to April were a consequence of a strong jump in orders in the second half of 2017.
""The weakness of the global economy in the first quarter and uncertainty about trade policy also played a role,"" it said.
""(The order) backlog is still very high and business morale is still better than the long-term average despite a recent deterioration.""
Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank said that the orders figures suggested that the German economy's relatively weak performance in the first quarter was just a blip.
""Provided the trade dispute does not escalate further, German GDP will regain some momentum in the second half of the year,"" Gitzel said.

The International Monetary Fund on Thursday cut its 2018 forecast for German GDP growth to 2.2 percent, saying rising protectionism and the threat of a hard Brexit had exposed Europe's biggest economy to significant short-term risks.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 06:58AM ET</span>","UK economy picks up speed, raising chance of rate rise","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's large services industry grew last month at its fastest rate since October, a survey showed on Wednesday, prompting investors to increase bets that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month.
After a weak first four months of 2018, the IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.1 in June, easily beating economists' average forecasts in a Reuters poll of 54.0, unchanged from May's reading.
June surveys this week for the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors also beat expectations.
Taken together, the three PMIs point to overall economic growth of 0.4 percent in the second quarter, double the pace of the first, IHS Markit said.
Sterling rallied and British government bond yields rose as financial markets priced in a greater chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates to 0.75 percent from the 0.5 percent they have stood at for most of the past decade.
In May, the BoE postponed a widely-expected rate hike after the economy slowed more than forecast in the three months to March, due in part to unusually harsh winter weather.
High inflation and continuing deep uncertainty about the terms Britain's departure from the European Union in March 2019 have acted as underlying drags on growth.
The central bank also said in May that in the event of a recovery, rates were likely to rise for only the second time in more than a decade as part of a gradual move away from the emergency stimulus program it rolled out during the financial crisis.
""These PMIs - the last before the Monetary Policy Committee finalize their August 2 decision - are consistent with a robust second-quarter rebound, and keep our call for an August hike on track,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Jacob Nell said.
SPEND WHILE THE SUN SHINES?
Last month BoE chief economist Andy Haldane joined two other members of the BoE's nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee in calling for a rate rise, and data was revised to show the first-quarter slowdown was less severe than first thought.
The BoE has forecast 0.4 percent GDP growth for the second quarter and also expects inflation to pick up in the coming months due to higher oil prices.
Wednesday's survey backed up the BoE's view, showing service firms contending with higher wage and fuel costs and overall input costs rising at the fastest pace since September 2017.
New business flowed in at the fastest rate in just over a year, with firms registering a boost to consumer spending from unusually warm weather. 
But expectations among businesses for the next 12 months -- during which Britain is due to leave the EU -- were below their average for the years since the financial crisis, with Brexit-related uncertainty to blame, IHS Markit said.
Britain cannot yet count on a transitional EU trade deal for the period immediately after Brexit, which means firms cannot rule out border disruptions after March.
""Such a divergence between current and expected future activity stokes worries that the upturn is being fueled by short-term spending ... and likely masks a lack of longer-term business investment,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.

Euro zone PMI data on Wednesday showed businesses in the bloc at their gloomiest since late 2016, despite activity growing at its fastest in four months, reflecting concerns about a possible trade war with the United States.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 06:09AM ET</span>",Euro zone business activity picked up in June but doubts linger: PMI,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth accelerated in June, offering encouragement to the European Central Bank to tighten policy, but optimism among purchasing managers was at its lowest ebb since late 2016, a survey found.
Faster growth across the currency union, alongside rising price pressures, will reassure ECB policymakers who last month said the bank would shut its hallmark bond purchase scheme by the end of the year.
But in a balanced announcement reflecting uncertainties hanging over the economy, the ECB signaled on June 14 that any interest rate hike was still distant.
Britain provided a similar story of stronger growth. Its large services industry grew last month at its fastest rate since October, suggesting the economy might be strong enough for the Bank of England to raise rates in August, as expected. 
IHS Markit's Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, seen as a good overall indicator of growth, rose to 54.9 in June from May's 54.1, comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
That beat an earlier flash reading of 54.8, but the latest PMI is lagging much higher numbers from around the turn of the year. The future output index, which tracks business optimism, fell to 63.4 from 63.7 -- its lowest since November 2016.
German services growth accelerated to a four-month high in June and French private sector activity picked up, helped by a rebound in the services sector that more than offset a further slowdown in manufacturing.
""STABILIZATION""
IHS Markit said the PMIs signaled second quarter economic growth of just over 0.5 percent, matching the median forecast in a Reuters poll last month. 
""This is a sign that at least some of the weakness in Q1 was temporary and at least suggests we are not embarking on the start of a sharp slowdown,"" said Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics said of the euro zone numbers.
""There has been some stabilization in the surveys if nothing else. That will reassure the ECB that a gradual normalization of policy is warranted.""
The June manufacturing PMI, released on Monday, showed euro zone factory growth slowed to an 18-month low, slipping for the sixth month in a row amid widespread concerns about trade barriers and their impact on economic activity. 
Services firms were less affected by fears of a trade war. Activity in the bloc's dominant industry accelerated, with the PMI jumping to a four-month high of 55.2 from 53.8.
That increase came despite firms raising their charges much more sharply. The services output prices PMI bounced to a five-month high of 53.2 from 52.0.
""Firms' costs and average selling prices for goods and services are meanwhile rising at rates close to seven-year highs, which will likely feed through to higher consumer price inflation in coming months,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Euro zone inflation rose to 2.0 percent in June, its highest rate for more than a year and above the ECB's target, preliminary data from Eurostat showed last week.

1490,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",UK Services PMI Rose at Fastest Pace in Eight Months in June,"Investing.com - Activity in the UK service sector accelerated at the fastest pace since October 2017 in June, according to a closely watched business survey released on Wednesday.
Research firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 55.1 in June from 54.0 in May, compared to forecasts for a reading of 53.9.
The expansion indicated that the recovery in growth since March’s snow related disruption is continuing. The upturn in service sector output was supported by the strongest increase in new work since May 2017, the report said.
But the rate of job creation remained modest in June, holding close to the 13-month low seen in April.
The report also showed that inflation intensified in June. Companies pointed to higher fuel bills and staff salaries, which resulted in the fastest rate of prices charged inflation since March.
""Stronger growth of service sector activity adds to signs that the economy rebounded in the second quarter and opens the door for an August rate hike, especially when viewed alongside the news that inflationary pressures spiked higher,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler Markit.
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector on Monday showed that activity continued at a steady pace in June, but worries over U.S. trade policy and Brexit saw business optimism fall to a seven-month low.
Another report on Tuesday showed that activity in the UK construction sector accelerated to a seven month high last month.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",German services sector growth rebounds in June: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Growth in Germany's services sector accelerated to the highest level in four months in June, a survey showed on Wednesday, adding to signs that consumption is fuelling an upswing in Europe's largest economy as exports weaken.
Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.5 from 52.1 in May, which was a 20-month low. The figure was higher than a flash reading of 53.9 but still below a near-seven-year high in January.
Markit put the rebound down to stronger new orders underpinned by higher domestic demand. To meet the higher demand, service providers hired new workers at the highest rate since January.
""June's increase in activity in the largely domestically focused service sector was the steepest seen since February and strong enough to offset a further loss of momentum across manufacturing, where slowing global trade has weighed on growth,"" said IHS Markit's principal economist Phil Smith.
""An expanding workforce base represents another factor supporting household spending, alongside upward wage pressures and still-elevated consumer confidence,"" he added.
Markit's PMI for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the German economy, fell to 55.9 from 56.9 in May, data showed on Monday.
The fall was attributed to manufacturing export sales and new orders growing at their slowest pace in more than two years. This signaled the sector was cooling as fears of a full-blown global trade war cloud the economic outlook.
The rebound in services more than compensated for the slower growth in manufacturing.

As a result, Markit's final composite PMI, which tracks activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to a three-month high of 54.8 from 53.4 in May.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",China services sector grows at fastest pace in 4 months in June - Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, July 4 (Reuters) - Growth in China's services sector accelerated in June to a four-month high, buoyed by a pickup in new businesses and a sustained increase in employment, a private survey showed on Wednesday.
However, respondents were less upbeat than in May - when they were the most optimistic in 11 months - about the business outlook for the year ahead. The level of optimism was below historical trends, weighed down by intensified inflationary pressure.
For June, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 53.9, the highest in four months, from May's 52.9. This indicated accelerating expansion, albeit softer than historical trends. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
The findings were largely in line with those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector released on Saturday, which showed the services PMI rising slightly in June.
China is banking on a stronger services sector to offset a smaller contribution from heavy industry and fixed asset investment as policymakers extend a multi-year campaign to crack down on risks, and look to emphasize more sustainable economic growth.
A solid services sector is also important for generating jobs as factories become more automated and the government aims to stop industrial overcapacity, which makes some employees out of work.
The services sector already accounts for more than half of China's economy, with rising wages giving its consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
The employment sub-index in Wednesday's Caixin PMI rose to 51.7 in June, the highest in 10 months, while growth in new business also picked up modestly from May.
Input costs rose at the fastest pace in four months, with companies citing higher prices for raw materials, transportation and staff. As a result, firms hiked prices charged to protect their operating margins. 
""Input costs rose more than prices charged, putting pressure on service providers' confidence,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group in a statement accompanying the June survey. 
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors showed a similar pattern of stronger growth, also rising to a four-month high in June, at 53.0, from the previous month's 52.3.
""The index of expectations regarding future output fell, suggesting less optimism across the manufacturing and service sectors, said CEBM's Zhong. 
Amid tightening credit and regulations, it is ""doubtful"" China's economic growth pace can stay stable, he said. 

Indeed, economic growth data in May already started to show signs of fatigue as credit expansion slowed and domestic demand ranging from government-funded infrastructure investment to consumer spending looked to be softening.
The slowdown comes just as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, with threats for up to $400 billion more that has policymakers and investors worried about the broader economic impact of a bitter trade fight.
Many economists expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and an ongoing crackdown on local governments' spending to keep their debt levels in check.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods unexpectedly rose in May, pointing to a strengthening manufacturing sector, but business spending on equipment continued to show signs of slowing.
Factory goods orders increased 0.4 percent amid strong demand for machinery, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Data for April was revised up to show orders falling 0.4 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent decrease.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders to be unchanged in May. Orders increased 8.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in May. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is being boosted by strong domestic and global demand, but growing shortages of workers as well as import tariffs are starting to strain the supply chain.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading largely higher while U.S. stocks rose. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. 
The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on a range of imported goods, including steel and aluminum, to protect domestic industries from what it says is unfair competition from foreign manufacturers. 
President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy has left the United States embroiled in tit-for-tat tariffs with its major trading partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union. 
An Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey of manufacturers published on Monday showed bottlenecks in the supply chain, with a measure of supplier deliveries hitting its highest level since May 2004. 
Manufacturers said the tariffs and ""lack of predictability"" of trade policy were causing ""general business instability"" and were a ""drag on growth for investments."" They also complained about an acute shortage of workers, especially truckers, and some manufacturers said transportation costs had ""gone through the roof"" as a result.
MACHINERY ORDERS RISE
In May, orders for transportation equipment fell 1.1 percent, weighed down by a 7.0 percent plunge in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft. Transportation orders declined 6.1 percent in April. 
Orders for motor vehicles rose 0.3 percent in May.
Orders for machinery increased 1.2 percent in May, extending April's 1.7 percent surge. That reflected an 8.9 percent jump in orders for industrial machinery. Demand for mining, oil field and gas field machinery fell 3.9 percent.
There were also declines in orders for primary metals, fabricated metal products as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components, and computers and electronic products. Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.5 percent in May while inventories rose 0.2 percent. The unfilled orders-to-shipments ratio fell to 6.68 from 6.73 in April.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, rose 0.3 percent in May instead of falling 0.2 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods jumped 2.0 percent in April.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.2 percent in May instead of dipping 0.1 percent as reported last month. Core capital goods shipments increased 0.8 percent in April.
Business spending on equipment is slowing after double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. The moderation in business spending on equipment could undercut the White House's argument that lower corporate tax rates would boost investment. 
Some companies like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) have used the tax windfall for share buybacks and dividends. 

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reported last week that its Capex Plans index declined in June for a third straight month. It said while the index still indicated a positive outlook for equipment spending in the second half of the year, it was past its peak.

In a separate release, the European statistics office said monthly prices at factory gates rose by 0.8 percent in May, higher than market expectations of a 0.4 percent rise, confirming the stronger inflationary pressure in the bloc. 
The volatile and often revised indicator of retail sales showed euro zone consumers spent in May the same as they did in April, when the volume of sales recorded a 0.1 percent fall on the month. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1 percent monthly rise in May.
Compared to a year earlier, in May retail sales were 1.4 percent higher than in April, but the increase was lower than the 1.5 percent anticipated by markets and was slower than the revised-down 1.6 percent growth in the previous month.
On a monthly basis, consumers spent more on food, drinks and tobacco, while they reduced their shopping of textiles and footwear, whose sales were down by 3.1 percent, and cut by 1.7 percent their online purchases. Purchases of fuel were unchanged on the month.
Consumers' lackluster appetite for shopping could partly have been caused by increased prices, with inflation rising to 1.9 percent in May in the euro zone from 1.3 percent one month earlier. Flash estimates from Eurostat showed that inflation increased further to 2.0 percent in June.
A similar trend was seen at factory gates, where prices rose 0.8 percent on the month in May after having been flat for two consecutive months. On the year, industry prices increased by 3.0 percent, above expectations of a 2.7 percent rise.
The monthly rise was mostly caused by a sharp increase in energy prices, which rose 2.6 percent after three consecutive monthly drops.

Prices increased also for intermediate and durable goods, like fridges and televisions, while they were unchanged for capital and non-durable goods.

Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.1 in June.
Analysts had expected the reading to hold steady at 52.5.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that house building remained the best performing area of activity while new orders rose at the fastest pace since May 2017.
The research firm also noted that input cost inflation accelerated in June.
“A solid contribution from house building helped to drive up overall construction activity in June, while a lack of new work to replace completed civil engineering projects continued to hold back growth,” IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore commented in the report.
Moore also added that survey respondents suggested that improved opportunities for industrial and distribution work were the main bright spots, which helped to offset some slowdown in retail and office development.
Stretched supply chains and stronger input buying resulted in longer delivery times for construction materials during June.
“At the same time, higher transportation costs and rising prices for steel related inputs led to the fastest increase in cost burdens across the construction sector since September 2017,” Moore concluded."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept rates at record lows for a 23rd straight month on Tuesday, citing sluggishness in inflation and wages at home and the risk to global growth from trade policy in the United States.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last cut rates to 1.50 percent in August 2016, making it easily the longest run without a change since the cash rate was first formalized in 1990.
It shows every sign of extending that run.
""Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said after the bank's monthly policy meeting.
""Gradual"" has become an oft repeated word as inflation remains stubbornly below the floor of its 2-3 percent target band and wages fail to revive despite solid job gains.
An added danger has come from U.S. President Donald Trump's use of tariffs against Europe and China, the latter being Australia's single biggest export market.
""One uncertainty regarding the global outlook stems from the direction of international trade policy in the United States,"" Lowe said, in typically understated fashion.
At recent events, he called a potential trade war the greatest single external threat to Australia's prosperity. Two-way trade accounts for around 45 percent of Australia's annual gross domestic product (GDP).
A DISTANT PROSPECT
A Reuters poll of 34 analysts had found all but one expected the cash rate to be left unchanged this week. An increase was not expected before the third quarter of 2019, compared to mid-year in the previous poll. 
Investors seem to agree with the market steadily pushing out the timing of any move. Interbank futures <0#YIB:> have priced in a rate of 1.70 percent for December 2019, implying around an 80 percent chance of a hike.
As recently as February, they had been fully priced for a rate rise in early 2019.
The domestic case for a hike has also been weakened by a sharp cooling in the country's once red-hot housing market. A clamp down by regulators on investment lending and rising funding costs for banks mean house prices nationally are now falling for the first time since 2012.
Sydney prices were down 4.5 percent in June, from a year earlier, according to data out this week from property consultant Core Logic. At the peak of the boom, they had been rising by more than 20 percent annually.
That is potentially a painful hit to wealth given the housing stock is valued at a heady A$6.9 trillion ($5.06 trillion).
""It's consistent with a fading 'household wealth effect' dragging on consumption,"" warned UBS economist George Tharenou.
""Macroprudential policy is reducing borrowing capacity and
leading to a clear weakening of housing, which we expect to continue ahead.""

The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.00 last month from 53.2 in May. A level above 50 indicates expansion. 
In April, the PMI dropped to its lowest level since the survey was launched in 2009 as private businesses were hit by the introduction of 5 percent value-added tax and domestic fuel price hikes at the start of this year.
Since then, however, there have been some signs that private sector activity is bottoming out, helped by higher oil prices, which promise to allow the government to spend more on supporting growth.
""The rise in the headline PMI to the highest level this year reflects a strong recovery in new orders, including export orders, and output,"" said Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD.
Output growth jumped to 59.1 in June from 56.9 in May while growth of new orders surged to 58.7 from 54.7. Employment growth rose slightly to 51.1.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity surged in June, but a strong economy and import tariffs were causing bottlenecks in the supply chain, which could potentially weigh on production in the months ahead.
Other data on Monday showed construction spending increasing solidly in May though investment in April was not as robust as initially thought. The reports reinforced views the economy was firing on all cylinders after slowing early in the year.
""It will take a lot to derail the U.S. economy because of the sugar high it's on from the fiscal stimulus, but a developing trade war between the U.S. and its trading partners is a mounting threat,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 60.2 last month from 58.7 in May. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The ISM noted that demand remained ""robust, but the nation's employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle."" It said manufacturers were ""overwhelmingly"" concerned about the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on a range of imported goods including steel and aluminum.
President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy has left the United States embroiled in tit-for-tat tariffs with its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Trump claims that the United States is being taken advantage of by its trade partners.
Analysts fear the tariffs could disrupt supply chains, undercut business investment and potentially wipe out the fiscal stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package.
The ISM's supplier deliveries sub-index soared 6.2 points to 68.2 last month, the highest level since May 2004 and accounting for the bulk of the increase in the ISM index. 
A lengthening in suppliers' delivery time is normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index as it means that suppliers need to steep up production.
""It is a warning, however, as it means that materials and supplies are becoming harder to acquire,"" said Michael Montgomery, a U.S economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts. ""That could put a damper on the party later this year if supply conditions do not get better.""
Manufacturers of electrical equipment, appliances and components said ""U.S. tariff policy and lack of predictability, along with (the) threat of trade wars"" was causing ""general business instability"" and was a ""drag on growth for investments.""
One manufacturer in the food, beverage and tobacco products industry said it was preparing to shift production ""for China market from the U.S. to our Canadian plant to avoid higher tariffs."" 
It would join a growing number of companies, including Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG), which last week said it would move production of motorcycles exported to the European Union from the United States. 
The ISM survey's new orders index slipped as did the measure of factory employment. Machinery manufacturers reported difficulties finding qualified workers, and several industries complained about trucking challenges last month.
While the prices paid index also fell in June, that was probably because of a decline in crude oil prices. Manufacturers continued to report surging input costs, with furniture makers describing transportation costs as ""going through the roof."" 
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies on the escalating trade tensions. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose while stocks on Wall Street fell.
CONSTRUCTION SPENDING RISES
In a separate report on Monday, the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 0.4 percent in May. 
Data for April was revised down to show construction outlays rising 0.9 percent instead of the previously reported 1.8 percent surge. The government revised the construction spending data going back to January 2011 in the May report.
Spending on private construction projects gained 0.3 percent in May after rising 0.4 percent in April. 
""Private construction spending in the second quarter is rising at a modest pace but indicators suggest that this gain is being more than absorbed by higher construction costs suggesting that construction will not contribute positively to second-quarter growth,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting second-quarter GDP rising at a 4.1 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent pace in the first quarter.

Investment in public construction projects increased 0.7 percent in May to the highest level since October 2010, after jumping 2.3 percent in April.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>","Beating expectations, euro zone unemployment stable in May","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Unemployment in the 19 countries sharing the euro currency was unchanged in May, European statistics office Eurostat said on Monday, defying economists' expectations of a worsening job market.
Euro zone unemployment was stable at 8.4 percent in May, with the number of job seekers falling slightly compared to April to 13.66 million. Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected an increase to 8.5 percent.
On a country-by-country basis, the number of job seekers declined most in Spain and Italy, while Portugal saw a small increase in unemployment. Rates in the bloc's largest economies France and Germany were stable in May.
While unemployment is a backward looking indicator, the figure is a rare positive surprise in the second quarter, in which euro zone growth has shown some signs of slowing down.
Most recently, economic sentiment data showed both managers and consumers were more gloomy about the economic outlook in June.
The European Central Bank expects the euro zone economy to grow by 2.1 percent in 2018, according to its latest forecast.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",UK manufacturing growth steadies in June but mood dips: PMI,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British factories kept up a steady pace of growth in June but worries about global trade and Brexit knocked confidence about the outlook to a seven-month low, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up to 54.4 from a downwardly revised 54.3 in May, beating the consensus of 54.0 in a Reuters poll of economists and above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Still, June capped the weakest quarter for the British manufacturing PMI in one and a half years, and survey compiler IHS Markit said prospects for the sector, which accounts for a tenth of economic output, looked doubtful.
Optimism fell to its lowest level this year as factory bosses fretted about cost pressures, possible future trade tariffs, the exchange rate, and Britain's departure from the European Union - now only nine months away.
The figures chimed with a Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank survey last week that also showed business confidence ebbed to its lowest level this year.
Data last week showed the economy's slowdown in early 2018 was less severe than first estimated, but business and consumer surveys have painted a mixed picture of the second quarter.
Bank of England officials weighing up the next rise in interest rates have been keen to emphasize the more positive numbers. 
""The turnaround in (manufacturing) performance since the start of the year has been remarkable, with impressive growth rates late last year turning into some of the weakest rates of expansion seen over the past two years,"" Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said about the PMI.
Manufacturers had become increasingly reliant on work backlogs and building up stock to maintain output, Dobson said.
""This is a position that cannot be sustained far beyond the immediate horizon,"" he said.

""With industry potentially stuck in the doldrums, the UK economy will need to look to other sectors if GDP growth is to match expectations in the latter half of the year.""

Euro zone factory growth slowed to an 18-month low in June, slipping for the sixth month in a row amid widespread concerns about trade barriers and their impact on overall economic activity, a survey showed on Monday.
IHS Markit's June final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to an 18-month low of 54.9 from May's 55.5, a touch lower than a flash reading but still well above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
The output index fell to 54.2 from 54.8 in May, its lowest since November 2016.
""Euro zone manufacturing reported its weakest expansion for one-and-a-half years in June, with risks clearly tilted toward output growth waning further in coming months,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The survey reveals mounting worries from companies relating to the impact of tariffs and trade wars, suggesting firms are bracing themselves for the potential for further export losses... Business expectations for future production deteriorated in June to the lowest since November 2015.""
Still, despite a more subdued growth and inflation outlook, the European Central Bank is expected to end its asset purchases by year-end as scheduled, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the risk that the program extends into next year was low.
But there was also nothing in the PMI report to suggest factories in the currency bloc will regain their robust activity levels of late last year. New orders growth in June slid to its lowest in nearly two years to 53.2, down from 54.2 in May.

Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index edged up to 54.4 in June, compared to forecasts for a reading of 54.1.
The prior month’s reading was revised down to 54.3 from a previously reported 54.4.
The upturn remained broad-based during June, the report said, as output and new orders rose. However, the overall rate of expansion in manufacturing output slowed as new order growth increased only slightly.
Business optimism dropped to a seven-month low amid rising concerns about possible trade tariffs, the exchange rate and Brexit uncertainty.
“The UK manufacturing sector ended the second quarter on a subdued footing,"" said Rob Dobson, director at survey compiler Markit.
""The turnaround in performance since the start the year has been remarkable, with impressive growth rates late last year turning into some of the weakest rates of expansion seen over the past two years in recent months,"" he added.

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, fell to 55.9 from 56.9 in May. That matched a preliminary reading.
The sixth consecutive monthly fall from a record high in December produced the lowest figure in 18 months.
While the headline number held well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction, the rate of expansion in new orders was the weakest since March 2016 and export sales growth was at its lowest in more than two years.
Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said the survey pointed to underlying downward pressure on output levels, which have been growing at a higher pace than new orders.
""The question is whether there is worse still to come,"" he said. ""Firms have indeed become less optimistic in their expectations toward output, with tariffs seen as an added headwind to growth in the months ahead.""
Data has this year has pointed to a cooling trend in Germany, and while many economists expect consumption to drive a continuation of growth albeit at a slower pace, trade tensions are weighing.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on European cars on top of duties he imposed on steel imports from the EU.
German business leaders also fear that a trade standoff between China and the U.S. could harm manufacturers who rely on the world's two largest economies for growth.
""The sector's overall pace of growth may have shifted down another gear, but that hasn't stopped manufacturers from creating more jobs, with the pick-up in the rate of employment growth one bright spot from June's survey,"" said Smith.
""A strengthening domestic market will go some way to offset the loss of exports.""

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 12:33AM ET</span>",Solid capital spending plans a bright spot in Bank of Japan's downbeat tankan,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence among Japan's big manufacturers worsened for a second straight quarter in the three months to June, a Bank of Japan survey showed, with the outlook clouded by U.S. trade protectionism and rising input costs.
It was the first time since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe swept to power in December 2012 that manufacturers' morale has soured for two straight quarters, raising worries that his reflationary ""Abenomics"" policies may be sputtering.
Industrial sectors such as cars and oil dragged down the overall mood, adding to concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump may target auto imports from Japan and other trading partners for protectionist tariffs after imposing stiff duties on steel and aluminum.
The quarterly BOJ tankan's headline index of plus 21 undershot the median estimate of plus 22 in a Reuters poll of analysts, and is expected to stay flat over the next three months.
Still, the survey also showed that big firms plan to raise their capital spending by 13.6 percent in the financial year starting April 2018, handily beating economists' median estimate of a 9.3 percent gain.
""Manufacturers' sentiment is leveling off while capital expenditure holds firm. I'm watching how fears of trade protectionism may affect corporate capex planning from now on,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, a senior economist at Nomura Securities.
SOLID CAPEX
Big manufacturers plan to increase capital expenditure by 17.9 percent this fiscal year, the fastest gain for June surveys since 2015, the tankan showed.
Large non-manufacturers plan to raise capex by 11.2 percent, making it the fastest increase for June surveys since 1990 during the peak of the bubble economy.
Economists expect capital expenditure will be supported by the need to upgrade production capacity and invest in labor-saving equipment to cope with labor shortages, and an infrastructure boom ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020.
A Bank of Japan official noted that although big firms' investment capex plans came out strong at the start of the new fiscal year, they could be revised down as the year progresses.
A private survey showed on Monday that Japanese manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in June, but export orders fell more than initially reported, an unwelcome sign of the potential impact of a trade war between the United States and major economies. 
WORRIES OVER PROTECTIONISM, YEN
The central bank will scrutinize the tankan results at its rate review later this month, at which its nine-member board will conduct a quarterly audit of its long-term growth and price outlook, and analyze factors behind subdued inflation. 
Policymakers and Japanese firms also worry that trade friction and potential gains in the safe-haven yen could undermine export-led growth.
The latest tankan showed big manufacturers set their expected dollar/yen rate at 107.26 for this fiscal year, compared with 109.66 seen three months ago, underscoring corporate caution about renewed yen strength. The dollar stood at around 111 yen  in the early Monday trade.
""Some manufacturers are worried about the yen rising, and this hurt their sentiment. Companies may be worried about some change in monetary policy or about the yen rising due to risk aversion,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The tankan shows the economy remains on solid footing, but it is not strong enough to allow the BOJ to head for the exit.""
Large non-manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 24 in June, slightly above a median forecast of plus 23, up one point from the previous quarter. It was seen worsening to 21 in September.
The tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

Japan's economy is expected to rebound in the second quarter from a contraction in the first quarter that ended the longest growth streak since the 1980s bubble economy.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) declined to 51.0 in June from May's 51.1, matching economists' forecast. 
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 13th consecutive month.
A sub-index for output rose to 52.1 in June, a four-month high, though new order growth slowed and companies chose to sell down existing inventories instead of restocking.
For graphic on China economic indicator dashboard click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/CHINA-ECONOMY/010031D432Z/index.html
The survey showed new export orders contracted for the third straight month and the most in two years, though there was no significant slide from the previous two months. 
China faces escalating trade tensions with the United States, its largest export market, adding to uncertainty about the manufacturing sector at a time when domestic demand also appears to be cooling.
Economic data in May showed China's economy is finally slowing, with weaker credit growth and a tighter liquidity environment hurting investment in local government building projects, which have helped boost the industrial sector.
This week the U.S. and China are set to impose new tariffs on each other's imports, with both sides threatening to up the ante if the other doesn't back down. 
Investors have punished Chinese stocks and the yuan currency since the trade dispute intensified over the last month, with the yuan taking a battering against the dollar in June and domestic stocks tumbling the most in a month since January 2016.
For now, though China's factories appear to have maintained solid overall growth, despite the government's war on industrial pollution, a slowing housing market and a tightening funding environment.
Official PMI released on Saturday did show a slowing of factory growth in June, with the manufacturing index slipping to 51.5, from May's 51.9. 
Underscoring growing anxiety about the outlook, Caixin's June survey found that manufacturers were the least optimistic they have been about future growth prospects since December. 
""Overall, the manufacturing PMI survey pointed to strengthening price pressures in June. Deteriorating exports and weak employment, along with companies' destocking and poor capital turnover, put pressure on the manufacturing sector,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the survey.
Input price pressures picked up again in June, with firms citing higher prices for commodities such as steel, signaling an increase in cost burdens for Chinese factories. 
Manufacturers raised their sales prices at the fastest pace since September. 
The employment situation for factory workers worsened in June, with a sub-index showing Chinese factories cut staff at the fastest pace since last July.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",Japan June manufacturing PMI shows growth but export orders contract,"TOKYO, (Reuters) - - Japanese manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in June, but export orders fell more than initially reported in a worrying sign of the potential impact of a heated trade dispute between the United States and major economies.
The final Markit/Nikkei survey for Japan on Monday showed the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 53.0, lower than the flash reading of 53.1 but still above a final 52.8 in May.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 22nd consecutive month.
""Japan manufacturing PMI data continue to signal that the sector's current expansion phase still has legs,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Concerns do remain however, as new order growth eased to a ten-month low and export sales decreased for the first time since August 2016.""
A bitter trade dispute between the United States and major economies, including Japan's big export market China, has unnerved investors and policy makers worried the tariff fight could deal a body blow to the global economy.
Indeed, while factory output grew at a robust pace last month in a sign of strength in the manufacturing sector, that solidity could be put to the test if exports continue to decline. 
The final index for new export orders went below the preliminary 49.5 and was off May's 51.1 - marking the first decline in 22 months.

Japan's economy is expected to rebound in the second quarter from a contraction in the first quarter that ended the longest growth streak since the 1980s bubble economy. Many economists say trade protectionism is the biggest risk to the outlook.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Brexit clouds UK financial sector mood,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks' Brexit worries were a key theme in a quarterly survey of Britain's financial services sector, published on Monday, even though business sentiment stabilized in the second quarter, ending a near two-year slide, and recruitment picked up.
The survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and PwC polled 100 firms across the UK financial sector found that a third of banks said they were ""not so confident"" of implementing Brexit plans by March. They were also worried about the status of their cross-border contracts during a transition period to the end of 2020.
A transition deal due to start next March when Britain leaves the European Union has yet to be ratified to give financial firms legal certainty.
The future shape of EU-UK trade relations in financial services, Britain's most important economic sector, has also yet to be agreed. The lack of clarity has prompted banks and insurers operating in Britain to open hubs in the EU.
""Brexit continues to drive uncertainty amongst sector players, from the smaller operators to the market leaders,"" Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC, said.
""Location planning, people movements and client retention remain at the top of the agenda, despite the extra time afforded by the transition period,"" Kail said.
Last week, the Bank of England dismissed criticism from the European Union's banking watchdog that lenders' preparations for a potentially disorderly Brexit were inadequate.
BoE said the EU needed to reciprocate British willingness to legally underpin billions of pounds in cross-border derivatives contracts to avoid market disruption.
CBI Chief Economist Rain Newton-Smith said three years had passed since any significant improvement in overall sentiment in financial services.
""In order for the sector to continue to attract investment and create jobs in the run up to Brexit and beyond, the government must work hard with Brussels to agree a unique agreement that develops the sector after Brexit,"" she said.
The survey showed that existence of the transition period has not persuaded many financial firms to put Brexit contingency planning on hold.
It also found that business volumes were flat in the three months to early June, but these were expected to pick up over the next three months.
Recruitment rose for a second straight quarter and investment in IT was anticipated to rise at the fastest pace in more than three years, spurred by new services and compliance with new regulation, the survey said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A record 75 percent of major British companies are now pessimistic about Brexit, a survey showed on Monday, adding to signs of anxiety around the economy as Britain's divorce with the European Union draws near.
Weak investment and waning expectations for sales marked Deloitte's latest quarterly survey of chief financial officers (CFOs), watched by the Bank of England as a gauge of business confidence.
The proportion of CFOs who said Brexit was likely to hurt the business environment was up from 68 percent in the previous Deloitte CFO survey published in April.
With nine months to go until Britain leaves the EU, Deloitte said more large British companies than at any time since late 2012 had adopted a defensive financial strategy. 
The accountancy firm's report chimed with a Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank survey last week that showed optimism across British businesses about the outlook has faded to its lowest level this year.
Britain will leave the European Union in March 2019 but a transitional trade agreement has still to be finalised amid disagreements among Prime Minister Theresa May's team over Britain's future relationship with Europe.
Last month, multinational companies Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) warned their investments in Britain could be at risk if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. They directly employ about 30,000 people in Britain.
""Uncertainty about the timing and the nature of the Brexit settlement has added to CFOs' worries about the final destination of the Brexit process,"" Deloitte Chief Economist Ian Stewart said.
""The boost to CFOs' spirits we saw in the last survey, following the announcement of the Brexit transition deal, has been short-lived.""
A net 17 percent of large companies said they expected revenues to rise in the coming 12 months, down from 31 percent in the first quarter of the year, the survey showed.
And only 10 percent of large companies said increasing capital spending was a strong priority, down from 12 percent in the last survey. 
Official data last week showed business investment fell 0.4 percent in the first quarter, the sharpest fall since late 2016. 
The Deloitte survey took place between June 3 and June 14, with 103 CFOs, including 20 executives from FTSE 100 companies and 45 from the FTSE 250 group, taking part.

Another closely-watched business survey, the IHS Markit/CIPS survey of the manufacturing industry, is due at 0830 GMT.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",South Korea's June exports slips amid China-U.S. trade war fears,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's export growth came to a halt in June, as shipments of cars and consumer electronics fell sharply, casting a shadow over prospects for this year amid escalating trade tension between China and the United States, data showed on Sunday.
Exports totaled $51.2 billion, down 0.1 percent from a year earlier, below a gain of 0.4 percent forecast in a Reuters survey and falling back after a 13.2 percent jump in May, government data showed. 
Imports were up 10.7 percent from a year ago, underperforming the survey's forecast for an 11.4 percent increase. 
The export sector's sudden loss of growth may herald tougher times after a stellar performance over the past year, as Asia's fourth largest economy could become caught in the crossfire following the retaliatory imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and China, as well as the European Union. 
""China-U.S. trade will be hit with a new set of tariffs starting July 6, and that's clouding the outlook for Korean exports in the second half,"" said Lee Sang-jae, chief economist at Eugene Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul.
The weaker export performance was also partly down to a statistical base effect from particularly strong export growth in June 2017, when South Korea won major shipbuilding contracts, Lee also said. 
Of the nation's 13 major export items, shipments of seven items including semiconductors, petrochemical products and computers gained, according to the nation's trade ministry. 
Car exports dragged the overall exports by declining 9.9 percent on-year, while exports of display panels and consumer electronics dropped 10.5 percent and 21.6 percent, respectively.
By destination, exports to China surged 29.8 percent, while shipments to the U.S. gained 7.6 percent year-on-year for the first 20 days of June. Shipments to ASEAN countries and the Middle East declined 1.3 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively.
Policymakers worry that South Korea's exports to China, its biggest trading partner, could suffer from any decline in U.S.-China trade because a large chunk of Korean exports to China are intermediate goods used in products assembled for sale elsewhere.
Commenting on outlook for China-bound exports, Korea's trade ministry said frictions between the U.S. and China ""could put downward pressure"" and squeeze South Korean shipments to China in the second half even as economic growth in the world's second biggest economy looks stable. 

The government is expecting annual economic growth of 3 percent this year, supported by the chip boom and an increase in fiscal spending.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed in June after a better-than-expected performance in May, official data showed, as escalating trade tensions with the United States fuel concerns about a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
China's economy has already felt the pinch from a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending that has driven up corporate borrowing costs, promoting the central bank to pump out more cash by cutting reserve requirements for lenders.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Saturday fell to 51.5 in June, below analysts' forecast of 51.6 and down from 51.9 in May, but it remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for a 23rd straight month.
The findings are in line with recent data including credit growth, investment and retail sales pointing to slowing growth in China's economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and a heated trade row with the United States.
Significantly, the June new export orders index contracted for the first time since February, dropping to 49.8 from 51.2 in May. 
A production sub-index fell to 53.6 in June from 54.1 in May, while a new orders sub-index declined to 53.2 from 53.8.
The PMI for large-sized firms fell to 52.9 in June from 53.1 in May, the index for medium-sized firms dipped to 49.9 from 51.0 while that for small firms rose to 49.8 from 49.6.
PRESSURES ON DEMAND
""Domestic demand is weakening and external demand faces pressure from escalating trade frictions between China and the United States,"" said Wen Bin, senior economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing.
Wen said he expected the central bank to continue to lower banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) in the coming months to help ward off a sharper economic slowdown.
The central bank said on June 24 it would cut the RRR by 50 basis points for some banks to accelerate the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spur lending to smaller firms.
After May's official factory PMI touched an eight-month high, there have been increasing signs that China's economy is finally slowing. 
Credit growth has slowed this year as the government cracks down on many types of lending, and the tighter liquidity environment appears to be impacting growth.
On July 16, the government is due to release data on second-quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and other key indicators. 
Analysts at ANZ forecast second-quarter growth of 6.7 percent, from 6.8 percent in the first quarter.
In May, industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment all missed expectations as auto sales dropped, and local governments scaled back building projects amid scrutiny from Beijing over their borrowings.
While the economy could likely handle these domestic challenges without growth slowing dramatically, the trade dispute with the U.S. is adding to uncertainty about how China's economy will react.
As U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure on China with threats of new tariffs and investment restrictions, China's stock markets and currency suffered one of their worst months in years in June. 
JUNE MARKET LOSSES
After a sustained sell-off, China's yuan and stock markets recovered some ground on Friday, yet investors were grappling with some of their worst losses in years as a bitter Sino-U.S. trade row threatened to rattle the country.
The United States has threatened to impose duties on up to $450 billion of Chinese imports, with the first $34 billion portion set to go into effect on July 6.
China's exports have held up relatively well so far this year, with May shipments rising 12.6 percent in dollar terms.
But the contraction in new export orders in June could indicate tougher times ahead for exports. 
A sister survey showed growth in China's service sector picked up slightly in June, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rising to 55.0 from 54.9 the previous month.
A sub-reading for construction activity, a major driver of growth in 2017, stood at 60.7 in June, up from 60.1 in May.
Chinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for more than half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.

The composite PMI covering both manufacturing and services activity slipped to 54.4 in June, from May's 54.6.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 01:13PM ET</span>",U.S. core PCE price index hits 2 percent; spending slows,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices accelerated in the year to May, with a measure of underlying inflation hitting the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for the first time in six years.
The rise in price pressures reported by the Commerce Department on Friday will probably not shift the Fed from its stated path of gradual interest rate increases as policymakers have indicated they would not be too concerned with inflation overshooting its target.
""This doesn't warrant the Fed turning more hawkish, as two additional rate hikes this year remain appropriate,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed expects inflation to temporarily overshoot its inflation objective.""
The U.S. central bank increased interest rates early this month for a second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes by the end of 2018. Inflation is pushing higher in part because of a tightening labor market, which is characterized by a 3.8 percent unemployment rate.
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in April. In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index surged 2.3 percent. That was the largest rise since March 2012 and followed a 2.0 percent increase in April. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.2 percent for a sixth straight month.
That lifted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 2.0 percent, the biggest gain since April 2012. The annual core PCE price index rose 1.8 percent in April. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors kept a wary eye on developments surrounding growing tensions between the United States and its major trade partners.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Friday denied a report that President Donald Trump wanted the United States to withdraw from the World Trade Organization. The trade tensions are starting to hurt consumer morale. A survey by the University of Michigan showed consumer confidence dipping in late June and households' near-term inflation expectations ticking up. 
The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
CONSUMER SPENDING COOLS
With inflation accelerating, consumer spending moderated. The government said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.2 percent in May. Data for April was revised down to show spending rising 0.5 percent instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent jump.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast spending gaining 0.4 percent last month. Spending was held back by a drop in outlays on household utilities. Purchases of long-lasting goods such as motor vehicles edged up 0.1 percent in May. 
Nondurable goods purchases increased 0.6 percent, likely reflecting higher gasoline prices. Outlays on services ticked up 0.1 percent. The slowdown in consumer spending last month was also the result of households boosting savings.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged in May after increasing by a downwardly revised 0.3 percent in the prior month. The so-called real consumer spending was previously reported to have increased 0.4 percent in April.
Last month's flat reading and the downward revision to April's data prompted the Atlanta Fed to cut its lofty second-quarter consumer spending and gross domestic product estimates.
The Atlanta Fed is now forecasting second-quarter GDP rising at a 3.8 percent annualized rate instead of the 4.5 percent pace it had projected before the consumer spending data was released.
""Right now, the extended period of strong growth that so many are predicting is just a wish and a hope,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Households seem to taking their tax cuts and saving them.""
Growth in consumer spending braked to a 0.9 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the slowest pace in nearly five years, after rising at a 4.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent pace in the first three months of the year. 
Still, consumer spending remains supported by the robust labor market and lower income tax rates which came into effect in January. Last month, personal income rose 0.4 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in April. Wages increased 0.3 percent. 

Savings rose to $482.0 billion in May from $448.0 billion in the prior month.

1513,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index Revised Lower on Tariff Concerns,"Investing.com - A key gauge of U.S. consumer confidence was revised lower in June, according to a survey released on Friday.
The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index was revised down to 98.2 from 99.3.
Economists had forecast a reading of 99.2.
A sub index tracking consumer expectations fell from 87.4 to 86.3.
A separate gauge tracking current conditions decreased from 117.9 to 116.5.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months increased to 3.0% from 2.9%, while the five-year gauge held steady at the previous 2.6%.
The survey center’s chief economist Richard Curtin noted that consumer sentiment retreated in late June to just above the May reading “largely due to concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on the domestic economy.”
For the year ahead, consumers still anticipated that the economy would produce small additional declines in the unemployment rate as well as higher wage gains, Curtin said.
“Consumers also anticipated an uptick in inflation during the year ahead, partly due to rising energy prices and partly due to tariffs,” he added.
This economist noted that it was likely that higher tariffs would likely take some time for consumers to digest as they needed to gains experience with the actual change in product prices and employment.
“While tariffs may have a direct impact on only a very small portion of overall GDP, the negative impact could quickly generalize and produce a widespread decline in consumer confidence,” Curtin concluded."

The final figure compared with a preliminary deficit of $28.2 billion, the foreign exchange regulator said in a statement.
The first quarter data comes at a time of growing worries in China about a trade war with the United States.
The quarter's current account deficit was equivalent to 1.1 percent of gross domestic product and is still within a reasonable range, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its website.
Fears of a full-scale trade war with Washington have magnified concerns about the outlook for the world's second-largest economy, fuelling a sell-off in Chinese stocks and the yuan currency .
Analysts attributed the first quarter's rare current account deficit to China's narrowing trade surplus and a widening services trade deficit.
""The volatile goods surplus and widening service trade deficit show that China's current account balance could be more volatile in future,"" said Tommy Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.
""Fundamentally, it will provide less support for the yuan,"" he said
The 2017 current account surplus was equivalent of 1.3 percent of China's gross domestic product, down from 1.8 percent in 2016, according to official data released earlier.
The ratio has been falling steadily from as high as 10 percent in 2007.

For the January-March period, China recorded a $72.5 billion surplus in its capital and financial account, compared with a preliminary surplus of $28.2 billion, the regulator said.

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Stronger April services output and first-quarter GDP boost UK rate hike bets,"By David Milliken and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's services sector gathered steam in April and first-quarter GDP growth was revised up, official data showed on Friday, raising hopes of a pick-up after a sluggish start to 2018 that has kept Bank of England interest rates on hold.
Services output, which makes up four-fifths of Britain's economy, rose by 0.3 percent on the month in April, its fastest growth since November 2017. 
Services output was up 1.6 percent from April 2017, picking up speed from the first quarter when it grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.
Sterling rallied against the dollar and the euro after the data, and interest rate futures raised the implicit probability of an August rate rise by the BoE to 60 percent from 50 percent.
Britain's economy as a whole grew 0.2 percent on a quarterly basis in the first three months of 2018, an unexpected upward revision from an initial estimate of 0.1 percent. The ONS said the construction sector had shrunk less than it first thought.
""The barriers to an August rate rise have come down as a result of this release,"" Investec economist Philip Shaw said.
""In terms of the dynamics of how Q2 growth is playing out, it looks better than previously.""
On the year, Q1 GDP growth was unchanged at 1.2 percent, its weakest annual growth rate since Q2 2012 and in line with earlier estimates from the ONS and a Reuters poll.
During the early part of the year, Britain was hit by unusually icy weather, on top of a squeeze on consumers from inflation caused by a weak pound and many businesses' reluctance to invest while the terms of Britain's March 2019 exit from the European Union remain unclear.
At the end of last year, Britain was the slowest-growing economy in the G7 group of rich nations; on Friday, the ONS revised 2017 growth down to 1.7 percent, its lowest since 2012.
The Bank of England predicts gross domestic product (GDP) growth will pick up to 0.4 percent on a quarterly basis in the three months to the end of June, as the economy rebounds from February and March's snow.
If the economy looks on course for this, most economists polled by Reuters expect the BoE to raise rates, for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis, on Aug. 2 after its next rate meeting. 
The ONS releases second-quarter GDP data on Aug. 10.
Official data for April industrial output and construction have been weak, but retail sales have been stronger and private-sector surveys point to some recovery in May and early June. 
May mortgage approvals data released by the BoE on Friday beat economists' expectations, though closely-watched consumer sentiment figures released overnight were lackluster.
Friday's ONS data also showed that Britain's current account deficit narrowed to 17.72 billion pounds ($23.33 billion), compared to economists' expectations that it would hold broadly steady at 18 billion pounds in the first three months of 2018.
As a share of GDP, this amounts to 3.4 percent, its lowest in a year, though it is still high by international standards.
On Wednesday, the BoE said Britain's current account deficit was the biggest in the G7 and made it vulnerable to a fall in foreign investors' appetite for British assets, which could lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses and households.

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 2.0 percent from 1.9 percent in May, EU statistics office Eurostat said on Friday. The figure was in line with market expectations as energy prices in particular spiked.
Inflation was last at 2 percent in February 2017.
Excluding volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, inflation was 1.2 percent, just below the average forecast of economists for no change from the 1.3 percent in May. 
Another core inflation measure, also excluding alcohol and tobacco prices, was 1.0 percent in June, from 1.1 percent in May and in line with expectations.
Energy prices were up 8.0 percent year-on-year, while unprocessed food was 3.0 percent more expensive.
The ECB has a mandate to keep inflation below but close to 2 percent, a task that has proven challenging, even with economic growth on its best run in a decade. 
The ECB decided earlier this month to end its 2.6 billion euro ($3.0 billion) bond purchase program by the close of the year but said interest rates would stay unchanged at least through summer 2019.
But the threat of a global trade war and the unclear budget policies of the new Italian government present major risks for the euro zone economy.

The bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said its consumer price inflation rose 2.0% in June from the same month a year earlier.
That was higher than the 1.9% seen in May, but in line with forecasts.
According to Eurostat, energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in June (8.0%, compared with 6.1% in May), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (2.8%, compared with 2.5% in May), services (1.3%, compared with 1.6% in May) and non-energy industrial goods (0.4%, compared with 0.3% in May).
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose by an annual rate of 1.0% in June compared to 1.1% in the previous month.
That was in line with the consensus forecast.
The European Central Bank targets a headline inflation rate of close to, but just below 2%.

Data published by the national INSEE statistics office on Friday showed that EU-harmonised French consumer prices rose 2.4 percent, the highest since August 2012. The higher French inflation figures also came a day after inflation in Germany also surpassed the ECB's 2 percent target.
With inflation gaining ground in the euro zone, the ECB said earlier this month it would end its crisis-era bond buying program -- originally designed to ward off deflation and stimulate the economy. But it signaled that any interest rate rise remains distant.
A breakdown of the French data showed jumps in tobacco and energy prices had contributed the most to the pick up in inflation.
President Emmanuel Macron's government increased taxes on cigarettes and planned tax hikes on diesel and gasoline kicked in at the start of the year which, combined with rising crude oil prices, has pushed prices at the pump to an all-time high in May. 
That has hit French consumers, with their buying power falling by 0.6 percent in the first quarter, according to INSEE data released earlier this month. Data early on Friday also showed that consumer spending had fallen 0.2 percent over the year in May.
The government says lower payroll taxes starting from October and falling unemployment will eventually boost purchasing power.
BACKGROUND
French EU-harmonized inflation fell to a historical low of -0.8 percent in July 2009 and hit an all-time high of 4.0 percent in July 2008, according to INSEE's records going back to 1991.

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 01:22AM ET</span>","Japan's May factory output eases as labor market tightens, trade fears cloud outlook","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output declined far less than expected last month and the jobless rate hit its lowest in over 25 years in a sign of a gradual economic recovery from a slump in the first quarter, though risks to the outlook have increased from U.S. trade protectionism. 
A bitter trade dispute between the United States and major economies, including Japan's big export market China, has unnerved investors and policy makers worried the tariff spat could deal a body blow to the global economy. 
How well Japan's manufactures perform will likely be key to the growth outlook, and so Friday's data showing industrial output fell 0.2 percent month-on-month in May is not all bad news, coming off better than the median forecast for a 1.1 percent decline. Output rose 0.5 percent in April.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expected output to rise 0.4 percent in June and 0.8 percent in July in an encouraging sign for capital expenditure.
Economists expect output to continue to rise gradually as overseas economies gather strength, though the trade friction with the United States poses the biggest risk to the outlook. 
""It is safe to say the economy is on the recovery path,"" said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""As long as the level of inventories comes down there should not be any major problems. I am worried about trade protectionism, but it is hard to predict what will happen.""
The jobless rate fell in May to 2.2 percent, the lowest in over 25 years as companies grappled with labor shortages. The jobs-to-applicants ratio, a measure of demand for workers, rose to 1.60 from 1.59 in April to the highest since January 1974. 
Japan's economy is expected to rebound in the second quarter from a contraction the first quarter that ended the longest growth streak since the 1980s bubble economy. 
The smaller-than-expected decline in output and the tightening labor market may offer some encouragement for the Bank of Japan.
In theory, a tight labor market should put upward pressure on wages, which would in turn push up prices. However, Japan has deviated from this textbook scenario. 
The labor market has steadily tightened, but wages have been slow to rise and some measures of consumer spending remain very weak.
Data due next week are forecast to show household spending fell for a fourth straight month in May, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The BOJ will conduct a quarterly review of its projections at a rate review in July and will examine whether recent weakness in consumer prices is temporary.
The May output decline was driven by a 6.9 percent drop in production of vehicles and a 1.9 fall in output of steel used in construction, the data showed.
Output of cars fell as some auto makers stopped production lines during Japan's annual Golden Week holiday during the first week of May, a government official told reporters.
Inventories rose 0.6 percent in May, following a 0.6 percent decline in the previous month, due to higher stocks of steel, motorcycles, and semiconductors, the data showed.

That’s positive news for the Bank of Japan as it struggles to generate 2 percent inflation. Consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator for the nation, rose more than expected after two months of slower increases.
Key Takeaways
The employment data released on Friday point to stronger upward pressure on wages, which so far haven’t responded as expected to the super-tight labor market. As companies struggle to find workers they’re hiring more staff on permanent, full-time contracts, which generally means higher pay and benefits. A job-applicant ratio at a 44-year high also points in the right direction for wages and inflation.
Still, challenges to the economy abound. The export-dependent nation faces fallout from global trade tensions and the slowing of growth in China. Japan’s factory output fell slightly in May after rising for three consecutive months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed more than previously estimated in the first quarter amid the weakest consumer spending in nearly five years, but growth appears to have since regained momentum on the back of a robust labor market and tax cuts.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.0 percent annual rate in the January-March period, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third estimate of first-quarter GDP, instead of the 2.2 percent pace it reported last month. 
The economy grew at a 2.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. The downgrade to first-quarter growth reflected weaker consumer spending and a smaller inventory build than the government had estimated last month.
A $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January, is expected to spur faster economic growth in the second quarter, putting annual GDP growth on track to achieve the Trump administration's 3 percent target. 
Economists, however, caution that the administration's ""America First"" policies, which have heightened fears of trade wars, are casting a pall over the economy's prospects. 
The United States is engaged in tit-for-tat trade tariffs with its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Analysts fear the tariffs could disrupt supply chains, undercut business investment and potentially wipe out the fiscal stimulus.
""Trade is a significant downside risk,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh. ""The potential of a trade war that threatens the global economic expansion could lead to weaker U.S. economic growth.""
Estimates of second-quarter growth are as high as a 5.3 percent rate. Economists had expected first-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at a 2.2 percent pace. 
The moderate first-quarter growth is probably not a true reflection of the economy's health as GDP tends to be weak at the start of the year because of a seasonal quirk.
An alternative measure of economic growth, gross domestic income (GDI), increased at a brisk 3.6 percent rate in the January-March period. That was revised up from the 2.8 percent pace reported last month.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.8 percent rate in the first quarter, instead of the 2.5 percent pace estimated in May. 
The income side of the growth ledger was boosted by after-tax corporate profits, which surged at an 8.7 percent rate last quarter rather than the 5.9 percent pace reported in May. The government slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent effective in January. After-tax profits rose at a 1.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies while prices of U.S. Treasuries dipped. Stocks on Wall Street were largely unchanged. 
CONSUMER SPENDING SLOWDOWN 
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, braked to a 0.9 percent rate in the first quarter instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent pace. It was the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013 and reflected downward revisions to healthcare spending by nonprofits and outlays on finance and insurance services.
Consumer spending grew at a 4.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Retail sales reports have suggested consumer spending was accelerating in the second quarter. Spending is being supported by a tightening labor market, which is gradually boosting wage growth.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed new applications for state unemployment benefits rose 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 227,000 for the week ended June 23, a level that remains consistent with a robust job market.
The unemployment rate is at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, close to the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year. 
""Claims remain low and the data continue to signal more than enough strength in employment growth to keep the unemployment rate trending down,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Weak domestic demand in the first quarter likely made businesses cautious about stocking warehouses. Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $13.9 billion instead of the $20.2 billion pace estimated last month. As a result, inventory investment was neutral to first-quarter GDP growth instead of adding 0.13 percentage point as reported last month. 
Data so far suggest that inventories could be a small drag on second-quarter GDP growth.
While the trade deficit in the first three months of the year was a bit bigger than initially thought, it had little impact on growth. Trade is expected to contribute to GDP growth in the second quarter after data on Wednesday showed a sharp drop in the goods trade deficit in May.
Growth in business spending on equipment was revised up to a 5.8 percent rate in the first quarter from the 5.5 percent pace estimated last month. Spending on equipment has slowed following double-digit growth in the second half of 2017.
The trend is likely to persist in the second quarter as the government on Wednesday reported an unexpected drop in both orders and shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft in May. 

The moderation in business spending on equipment could undercut the Trump's administration's argument that lower corporate tax rates would boost investment. Some companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have used their tax windfall for share buybacks and dividends.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.0% annual rate in the first three months of 2018, instead of the previously reported 2.2% pace, the Commerce Department said in its third GDP estimate.
That was a deceleration from the fourth quarter's brisk 2.9% pace.

Exports were also revised down to 3.6% from 4.2%, while imports were revised slightly higher, to 3.2% from 2.8% in the second estimate.
The increase in consumer spending was the weakest in nearly five years and it contributed, along with slower trade, to the downward revision to growth.
The slowdown was partially offset by a revision in corporate profits to 8.7% from 5.9% in the second estimate.
Meanwhile, a closely followed GDP tracker by the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates the U.S. will expand at a 4.5% annual rate in the second quarter. Preliminary data on second quarter growth is due on July 27.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Thursday that it is now offering a digital bank account for smartphones nationally after testing and refining the app in St. Louis since October.
The account, known as Finn by Chase, is geared especially to young adults who want to do their transactions on their phones, have no wish to go to branches and say they would like help saving money.
The national offer comes as banks large and small look for ways to use smartphones to compete for customer deposits inexpensively.
 Citigroup  Inc, (N:C) which has branches in just six U.S. cities, said in March that it will offer digital accounts nationally later this year.  Citizens Financial Group Inc , (N:CFG) a regional bank based in Rhode Island, has said it will launch a national platform in the third quarter.
The banks, however, want to avoid competing solely by paying higher interest rates.
To get customers for Finn, JPMorgan is offering $100 to people who open accounts and complete 10 transactions of certain types, such as sending money to another person or paying a bill.
The incentive is designed to make customers familiar with using the app, said Melissa Feldsher, head of Finn. She believes customers will stick with the accounts after seeing they can automatically make deposits to their savings accounts, such as moving $2 from their checking account every time they spend $5 with the app at a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shop. 
The bank is paying Finn users the same modest rates it pays on deposits to standard Chase accounts, Feldsher said. 
The bank is pitching Finn to ""digitally centric"" users of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. An app for Android phones is due by year-end.
JPMorgan sees Finn as a supplement to offering standard branch-based accounts. Most people still want to have branches nearby even if they rarely go to them, according to research by consulting firm Novantas.
""This is a way for us to attract more customers by having different products that speak to different people,"" Feldsher said. 
JPMorgan has 5,100 branches in 23 states and plans to open 400 new offices as it moves into new markets, including Washington, Boston and Philadelphia.
Chase is not considering giving credit card rewards as signing bonuses, Feldsher said.

Citigroup executives have said they expect to pitch credit card rewards for digital accounts. Offering high rates of interest would likely attract fickle ""hot money"" depositors, they have said.

Private consumption has become the main source of economic expansion in Germany in recent years, supported by record-high employment, increased job security, above-inflation pay hikes and low borrowing costs.
Nuremberg-based GfK said its consumer sentiment index, which is based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, held at 10.7 points after declining the previous two months. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the index would slip to 10.6.
""The trade conflict between the EU and the U.S. is intensifying and leaves a clear mark on the consumer mood in Germany,"" Rolf Buerkl, a researcher for GfK, said in a statement.
Economic expectations dropped 14.1 points to 23.3 points, the lowest in more than a year.
U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to impose hefty tariffs on car imports from Europe - a trade that Germany dominates - on top of earlier unilateral duties on metals.
Business leaders are worried that a similar trade confrontation between Washington and Beijing could harm German exporters who rely on the world's two largest economies for growth.
""The route taken by the U.S. president in terms of the trade policy towards the EU is causing concern, especially where economic expectations are concerned,"" Buerkl said.
But the subindex measuring consumer propensity to buy edged up to 56.3 points. A subindex measuring income expectations also rose, to 57.6 points, propelled by a stable job market and strong demand for workers.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank kept interest rates steady on Thursday and warned of rising risks to the outlook as growth slows and global trade frictions escalate, signaling its resolve to maintain record-low rates for some time.
The dovish tone of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) statement, which nodded to a recent run of weak data, reaffirmed market expectations that no rate hike was on the near-term horizon and even led some analysts to project a slim but possible chance of a rate cut.
The central bank held the official cash rate at 1.75 percent for the 11th straight review as it works to boost inflation to 2 percent, the center of its target band.
The statement from RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr had a slightly more dovish tone than at the meeting in May, adding warnings over recent weakness in economic growth and the potential fallout from escalating trade tensions among major economies.
""The recent weaker gross domestic product (GDP) outturn implies marginally more spare capacity in the economy than we anticipated,"" Orr said.
Trade tensions in some major economies also ""tempered slightly"" prospects that robust global demand will underpin New Zealand's economy, the central bank chief said in the RBNZ's strongest warning to date of the harm such frictions could inflict on trade and business activity.
""What we've got in our judgment is slightly on the dovish side,"" said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank.
""If we don't see any material improvement in business confidence or we see a lot more impact coming through from global trade tensions, you can't rule out a cut either.""
The RBNZ said policy will remain expansionary ""for a considerable period of time"", underscoring a dominant market view there will be no rate hike until mid-2019 at the earliest.
Analysts say the changes to the statement did not alter the thrust of the RBNZ's policy intentions.
But the tweak in wording underscored Orr's intent to break from the ambiguous messaging favored by many of his counterparts, and respond more flexibly to developments in the economy to make the bank's communication easier to grasp for the public.
The RBNZ said later on Thursday that it will change the day and time of its rate announcements, a move that lays the groundwork for a shift in how it decides policy.
""This change helps position the Reserve Bank for the upcoming shift to a decision-making committee structure,"" the bank said in an emailed statement.
Under the expected change in the decision-making structure, a committee of central bank officials and external experts would vote on policy decisions - a major change from the present, in which only the governor has that power.
GLOOMY OUTLOOK
Major central banks have struggled with soft inflation even as their economies strengthened on robust global trade, now under threat from trade frictions triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies.
New Zealand is no exception with headline annual inflation having slowed to 1.1 percent in the first quarter, just off the bottom of the RBNZ's target range of 1 to 3 percent.
Economic growth slowed to 0.5 percent in the first three months of this year, undershooting the RBNZ's forecast. A survey on Wednesday showed business confidence sank to a seven-month low in June, a sign the economy may be in for a soft patch.
""We are now worried that growth could slow by more than we have assumed,"" Capital Economics said, projecting that rates won't rise until mid-2020.
Analysts at ANZ expect a rate hike in November next year but warn that ""a lot can happen between now and then"".

""We see risks to domestic inflation as skewed to the downside, and we could equally argue for a flat track. And if conditions deteriorated significantly, a cut could eventuate quite rapidly,"" they said.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 10:50PM ET</span>",Japan's retail sales miss expectations as cautious consumers hold back,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Annual growth in Japanese retail sales slowed in May to its lowest in seven months, adding to worries about weak consumer spending that caused a first-quarter economic contraction.
The 0.6 percent annual increase in retail sales in May was weaker than the median estimate for a 0.9 percent gain, following a revised 1.5 percent increase in April.May's result marked the slowest growth since a 0.2 percent decline last October.
""Consumption is picking up gradually from the temporary decline at the start of the year but its rebound is weak due to sluggish wages,"" said Azusa Kato, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Securities.
""Employees' incomes are on the rise as a whole with many elderly and women joining the labor force as part-timers. But they don't have enough purchasing power to drive consumption.""
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales declined 1.7 percent in May, data from the trade ministry showed on Thursday. 
Japan's economy is expected to bounce back in April-June from the first-quarter contraction that ended the longest growth run since the 1980s bubble economy. Analysts said the slump was caused by one-off factors such as bad weather and saw it as temporary.
The trade ministry data showed on Thursday that growth in fuel sales led May's retail sales, reflecting higher gasoline prices, while spending on items such as clothes and cars declined in May from a year earlier.
While risks to the export-reliant economy abound, not least from a heated China-U.S. trade dispute that has roiled financial markets, weak domestic demand is a worry for policymakers struggling to stoke sustainable inflation.
A rise in private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of the economy could lift consumer prices, which may help the Bank of Japan accelerate inflation to its elusive 2 percent target.
A tight labor market has not yet fueled growth in wages, keeping Japan's thrifty consumers from splashing out, which in turn causes inflation to stay low.
Japan's annual core consumer inflation, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, held steady at 0.7 percent in May, well below the BOJ's 2 percent price goal, data out last week showed.
With inflation remaining stubbornly subdued despite more than five years of massive monetary easing, the BOJ is lagging well behind other central banks in unwinding crisis-mode stimulus.

The central bank will scrutinize upcoming data at its rate review in July, at which the nine-member board will conduct a quarterly review of its long-term growth and price outlook and analyze factors behind stubbornly slow inflation.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>","China factory growth seen cooling slightly in June, trade war a worry","BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector is expected to have cooled only slightly in June after a surprise pickup in May, which along with strong industrial profits last month should help allay concerns of a sharp economic slowdown. 
All the same, the country's massive factory sector could soon be facing significant new challenges as the latest tariffs in an escalating trade dispute between China and the United States are set to take effect on July 6. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is seen slipping to 51.6 in June from 51.9 in May, according to the median forecast of 25 economists in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
That would mark nearly two years of expansion for China's manufacturing sector, which has benefited from a housing boom, strong global demand for Chinese exports, and a rebound in commodity prices. 
There is little doubt though about the rising risks to the outlook, with economic growth in May weakening as credit expansion slows and domestic demand ranging from government-funded infrastructure investment to consumer spending looks to be softening.
The slowdown comes just as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, with threats for up to $400 billion more that has policy makers and investors worried about the broader economic impact of the bitter trade fight.
For now, the industrial sector has shown few signs of stress, with profits rising 21 percent in May as ex-factory price inflation has remained solid.
But Beijing isn't sitting still and has stepped in with measures to support growth even as it extends a campaign to tamp down on financial risks and reduce debt across the broader economy. 
The deleveraging effort has driven up borrowing costs for businesses and slowed the economy, and the fear is that any turmoil in China's markets could restrict Beijing's ability to pump-prime the economy as it tries to mount a defense in the trade battle with Washington.
The People's Bank of China on Sunday freed up more funds for lending by cutting required reserve levels for banks, with the policy set to become effective on July 5, one day before the tariffs take effect.
Separately, a private survey on China's factory activity is forecast to show a similar mild easing trend.
The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) is expected to have fallen slightly to 51.0 in June versus 51.1 in May.
The official PMI survey is due out on Saturday, along with a similar official survey on services.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on July 2, and the Caixin services PMI on July 4.

Key Takeaways
Weak retail sales, despite a string of national holidays early in the month, underscore that strong consumption has yet to take hold in Japan. That’s holding back the export-dependent economy. After a 2 percent surge in March, wage gains fell back to trend in April with a moderate 0.8 percent increase. That means consumers don’t have much extra free cash for discretionary spending.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 01:24PM ET</span>",U.S. business spending on equipment cooling; trade gap narrowing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods and shipments unexpectedly fell in May, but upward revisions to data for the prior month pointed to moderate growth in business spending on equipment in the second quarter.
Other reports on Wednesday showed a sharp narrowing in the goods trade deficit last month, the latest indication that the economy was accelerating this quarter after losing some steam at the start of the year.
There are, however, fears that escalating tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, including China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, could hurt business sentiment, disrupt supply chains and undercut economic growth.
""Factory managers are worried about the prospects of a full-blown trade war,"" said Ilir Hysa, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""That said, the sentiment reflected in the manufacturing surveys is not rattled. But trade policy tensions are clearly a major hurdle.""
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped 0.2 percent last month. April data was revised to show the so-called core capital goods orders surging 2.3 percent instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent rise.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.5 percent last month. Orders increased 6.8 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of these goods dipped 0.1 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.0 percent increase in April. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
They were previously reported to have gained 0.9 percent in April. The drop in core capital goods shipments last month did little to dampen expectations of robust GDP growth in the second quarter. Business spending on equipment increased at a 5.5 percent annualized rate in the first quarter and most economists expected a similar pace of growth in the April-June period.
In other data, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit declined 3.7 percent to $64.8 billion in May as an increase in exports outpaced a rise in imports. The department also said wholesale inventories increased 0.5 percent in May and stocks at retailers gained 0.4 percent. 
The smaller goods trade deficit was seen offsetting an anticipated drag from inventory investment. Reports on the labor market and consumer spending have suggested that economic growth surged in the second quarter. Gross domestic product estimates for the April-June period are as high as a 5.3 percent rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter.
HOUSING LAGGING
But housing continues to lag the strong economy, with reports on Wednesday showing contracts to buy previously owned homes falling again in May and applications for loans to purchase a home declining sharply last week. The housing market is being hobbled by land and labor shortages, leading to a dearth of houses available for sale.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
The slowdown in business spending on equipment is despite the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January. Some economists blamed the strengthening U.S. dollar and warned that the government's protectionist trade policy could restrain business investment. 
President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect domestic industries from what he says is unfair foreign competition. Trump has also said he would press ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose a 20 percent duty on all imports of European Union-assembled cars. 
China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union have retaliated in kind. Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) said on Monday it would move production of motorcycles exported to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast the trading bloc's retaliatory tariffs would cost the company $90 million to $100 million a year.
""Increasing trade protectionism could raise uncertainty and lower confidence, undermining the otherwise positive conditions,"" said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The decline in orders last month was almost broad. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components tumbled 1.5 percent, the biggest drop in six months. Orders for computers and electronic products fell 0.1 percent while those for fabricated metals decreased 1.2 percent. 
There were also declines in orders for primary metals. But orders for machinery rose 0.3 percent, extending April's 1.7 percent increase. Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dropped 0.6 percent in May as demand for transportation equipment fell 1.0 percent. That followed a 1.0 percent decrease in durable goods orders in April.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts plunged 4.2 percent last month, the largest decline since January 2015.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its pending home sales index fell to a reading of 105.9, down 0.5 percent from the prior month. April's 1.3 percent decline was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.5 percent in May.
On a year-on-year basis, pending home sales fell for the fifth month in a row in May. 
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the state of the housing market because they become sales a month or two later.
The housing market has been mixed this year. On Monday, data showed sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased more than expected in May as transactions in the South surged to their highest level in nearly 11 years.
But data last week showed U.S. home sales unexpectedly tumbling for the second straight month in May as an acute shortage of properties on the market pushed house prices to a record high.
In May, contracts in the Northeast increased 2.0 percent and were up 2.9 percent in the Midwest. They also edged up 0.6 percent in the West but slumped 3.5 percent in the South.

""Several would-be buyers this spring were kept out of the market because of supply and affordability constraints,"" Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. ""The healthy economy and job market should keep many of them actively looking to buy, and any rise in inventory would certainly help them find a home.""

NAR said its pending home sales index, which measures signed contracts for homes where transactions have not yet closed, fell 0.5% to a reading of 105.9 after falling by 1.3% in the previous month.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 1.1% last month.
NAR indicated that pending home sales have now fallen on an annualized basis for the fifth straight month, while May’s decrease was due to a larger decline in contract activity in the South that offset gains in the Northeast, Midwest and West.
""Pending home sales underperformed once again in May, declining for the second straight month and coming in at the second lowest level over the past year,” NAR chief economist Larry Yun said.
“Realtors in most of the country continue to describe their markets as highly competitive and fast moving, but without enough new and existing inventory for sale, activity has essentially stalled,” he explained.
Yun said that what he called a “lackluster spring” has primarily been a supply issue, and not one of weakening demand.
According to this expert, the underlying closing data in May showed that home price gains are still outpacing income growth, inventory declined on an annual basis for the 36th consecutive month, and listings typically went under contract in just over three weeks.
“With the cost of buying a home getting more expensive, it’s clear the summer months will be a true test for the housing market,” Yun said.
He highlighted the increase in new home construction to a 10-year high as an encouraging sign.
“Several would-be buyers this spring were kept out of the market because of supply and affordability constraints,” Yun remarked.
“The healthy economy and job market should keep many of them actively looking to buy, and any rise in inventory would certainly help them find a home,” he concluded."

Beijing is trying to walk a tightrope between supporting economic growth and tamping down financial risks, with policymakers freeing up more funds for lending by cutting required reserve levels for banks twice since April.
The latest cut came on Sunday as authorities moved fast to temper any potential drag on growth from the heated Sino-U.S. trade dispute. 
Industrial profits rose 21.1 percent to 607.1 billion yuan ($92.00 billion) in May, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday, compared to 21.9 percent growth in April. 
For the first five months, industrial firms notched up profits of 2.73 trillion yuan, an increase of 16.5 percent from a year earlier, versus a 15 percent increase in the January-April period.
The earnings jump in May was driven by price gains and lower costs, statistics bureau official He Ping said in a statement accompanying the data. 
He's comments were backed by data earlier this month showing China's producer price inflation picked up for a second month in a row in May to 4.1 percent.
In the first five months of the year, profit growth was largely underpinned by heavy industry, including ferrous metals processing, chemicals, and oil and natural gas extraction, He said. 
Profits for computer, telecommunications and other electronics rose 1.9 percent year-on-year in the Jan-May period, recovering from losses over the first four months. 
Some analysts say the strong profit growth reflects a recovery in output from an easing in a long-running crackdown on pollution that had shuttered production at many factories.
""We would argue that’s (profit growth) mostly a recovery from the pollution crackdown, which in our figures resulted in quite a significant slowdown in industrial production during the winter,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics.
""If we’re right then there’s no reason to expect that pick up to be sustained. In our view, the more medium term outlook is still not great.""
TRADE HEADWINDS
China's industrial firms have benefited from a hot property and infrastructure construction market over the past two years, which helped stimulate demand for building materials from steel bars to copper pipes, glass and cement. 
And while sales have cooled in the face of government restrictions on home purchases, new construction starts rose 20.5 percent in May and property investment also picked up, suggesting any property slowdown is likely to be relatively modest.
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec) (SS:600028) in the first quarter reported its best quarterly profit since June 2015 on strong earnings from its refining business, which saw higher margins.
China's steel output surged to a record in May as mills ramped up production to chase fat profit margins, with a strong outlook for demand likely to keep mills running at nearly full capacity for the rest of the year. 
Liuzhou Iron & Steel (SS:601003) said in April that its first quarter profit rose 416 percent. 
But activity in some parts of the economy including infrastructure investment and industrial output point to softening economic growth. 
While industrial commodity prices have been strong this year, the intensifying trade dispute between Beijing and Washington has rattled China's commodity markets this month as both sides threatened new import tariffs. 
The war against pollution, with government-ordered suspension of production for steel, cement, coal-fired power plans and petrochemical makers in recent months also add to the challenge for industrial producers ahead.
There are signs Beijing is worried about a slow down in the economy, and Sunday's reserve requirement cut suggests policy makers want to keep liquidity flush even as they extend a years-long effort to reduce debt and let ""zombie"" firms fail. 
While a campaign to reduce corporate leverage has pushed up some measures of corporate borrowing costs, a survey of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) found companies borrowed the most in five years in the second quarter at interest rates that were lower than a year ago. 
Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms rose 28.7 percent year-on-year in Jan-May period, quickening from a 26.2 percent increase in the first four months.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's export growth was expected to slow to a near halt in June, a Reuters poll found on Wednesday, weighed down by an escalating trade fight between the United States and other major economies even as the weaker won supported overseas sales. 
The median forecast from a survey of 10 analysts was for June exports to gain a mere 0.4 percent from a year earlier. Responses ranged from a 2.5 percent fall to a 4.3 percent jump.
Imports were projected to gain 11.4 percent this month in annual terms, the poll showed. 
Lim Hye-youn, an economist at Daishin Securities, said the retaliatory imposition of tariffs by the United States and China, as well as the European Union, must have weighed on trade sentiment in June, limiting export growth even with 1 1/2 more working days than June 2017. 
In May, a half-day more working time versus May 2017 helped exports rebound in annual terms after shipments fell in April for the first time in 18 months.
""Export growth for the second half is likely to slow down significantly from an average of 8.1 percent between January and May this year,"" Lim said.
""The trade dispute issue is a growing downside risk for exports, and economic recovery in non-U.S. countries could weaken and shrink global trade volume.""
Washington is drafting curbs that would restrict Chinese companies from investing in high-tech U.S. firms, another escalation of the Trump administration's trade dispute with China.
Policymakers worry that South Korea's exports to China, its biggest trading partner, could suffer from any decline in U.S.-China trade because a large chunk of Korean exports to China are intermediate goods used in products assembled for sale elsewhere. 
Lee Seung-hoon, an analyst at Meritz Securities, said there was also a statistical base effect from particularly strong export growth in June 2017, when South Korea won major shipbuilding contracts. 
Wednesday's poll showed annual inflation was seen at 1.7 percent in June, up from 1.5 percent in May.
May factory output was forecast to rise 0.1 percent from April when it jumped 3.4 percent. 
The industrial output data is due on Friday, while the trade data will be published on Sunday. The inflation figures are set for publication on July 3.

After two years of solid growth, manufacturers are starting to show signs of weakness, according to the quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB), with companies reporting the lowest growth in new export orders since late 2016 in Q2.
""Manufacturing's challenge is not now, it's next year. Export orders slipped and a major escalation in the U.S.-China tariff war may be in the offing,"" CBB said. 
If the trend persists for exporters, that will be bad news for Beijing, as there are also signs that growth in the domestic economy is moderating. 
""A trade conflict with the U.S. would hit what is already metastasizing into a sore spot for the Chinese economy,"" CBB said.
China's industrial output, investment and retail sales all grew less than expected in May, suggesting further weakness ahead if Beijing perseveres with crackdowns on pollution, questionable local government spending and off-balance sheet ""shadow"" financing.
CBB's survey did show some bright spots for the economy, however. The retail sector, which had been called out for weak performance by CBB in recent quarters, posted growth in revenue, profits and investment in the second quarter.
CBB said that while China's oft-touted credit tightening and deleveraging campaign has helped control the riskiest forms of lending, Chinese firms borrowed the most in five years and interest rates were lower than a year ago.
""Firms are not struggling with deleveraging; Beijing has simply shifted them to a different teat, while further subsidizing their costs,"" said CBB. 
Beijing surprised markets earlier this month when it did not follow a rate hike by the Federal Reserve, sparking concern regulators were worried about the health of the economy, and on Sunday the central bank cut the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves in a bid to channel more funds towards struggling debt-ridden and small firms.

""Firms have yet to demonstrate they can withstand a higher cost of capital and Beijing's reluctance to try them, even amidst a strong economy, is telling,"" CBB said.

The key agriculture sector plummeted 31 percent from April 2017, according to government statistics agency Indec, resulting in the first negative monthly reading for the economy of the South American grains powerhouse since February of last year. The economy shrank 2.7 percent compared with March.
Farming is the backbone of Argentina's economy. It is world's top exporter of soy meal and soy oil and one of the top shippers of corn and raw soybeans. The country's worst drought in decades, which ran between late 2017 and April this year, reduced both crops' harvests by tens of millions of tonnes. 
Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne has said the drought will reduce 2018 growth by 1.5 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP) and reduce the country's exports by hundreds of millions of dollars. 

After expanding nearly 3 percent in 2017, economists have cut their expectations for growth in Argentina this year as a result of the drought and a run on the peso currency  that triggered a financial crisis, prompting the country to turn to the International Monetary Fund for financing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S consumer confidence ebbed in June, with households a bit pessimistic about their short-term income prospects, suggesting that an apparent acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter was unlikely to be sustained.
Economists blamed the dip in confidence on escalating tensions between the United States and its trade partners. The survey published by the Conference Board on Tuesday potentially signals some cooling in consumer spending. Plans to buy big-ticket items like automobiles fell this month.
""Those storm clouds on the horizon from the trade wars may be starting to affect consumer confidence negatively and that bodes poorly for the economic outlook later on this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The United States is engaged in tit-for-tat import tariffs with major trading partners, including China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, which has roiled financial markets.
Economists have cautioned that the Trump administration's protectionist trade policies could offset the boost to the economy from the $1.5 trillion tax cut package passed late last year.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to a reading of 126.4 this month from an upwardly revised 128.8 in May. The index was previously reported at 128.0 in May. 
The cutoff date for the survey was June 15, the same day President Donald Trump announced he was pressing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing said it would respond with tariffs ""of the same scale and strength."" 
The United States is also in a trade fight with Canada, Mexico and the European Union over steel and aluminum.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on Tuesday, a day after the S&P 500 index (SPX) posted its steepest one-day loss since early April on trade-related worries.
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies and prices of U.S. Treasuries dipped. 
Economic growth appears to have surged early in the second quarter after hitting a soft patch at the start of the year. Gross domestic product estimates for the April-June period are as high as a 4.7 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the first quarter.
GROWTH SEEN SLOWING
""While expectations remain high by historical standards, the modest curtailment in optimism suggests that consumers do not foresee the economy gaining much momentum in the months ahead,"" said Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's director of economic indicators.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, fell to 25.1 this month from 26.5 in May. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and is consistent with continued shrinking of labor market slack.
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment, with the unemployment rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. But it has not spurred faster wage growth. 
The Conference Board survey showed the percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in income fell to 18.8 percent in June from 21.4 percent in May. The share of those expecting a decrease rose to 8.7 percent from 8.0 percent last month.
The survey also showed a decline in the number of consumers planning to buy motor vehicles and household appliances. There was a modest rebound in home purchasing plans after a drop in May. The share of consumers planning to take a vacation slipped this month.
Other data on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 6.6 percent in April on a year-over-year basis after increasing 6.7 percent in March. An acute shortage of homes on the market and strong demand are keeping prices elevated, though the momentum is slowing as mortgage rates rise.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 4.57 percent last week and has risen more than 50 basis points this year, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates earlier this month for a second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes by the end of the year.

""With mortgage rates set to rise over the remainder of the year, we expect house price growth will continue to slow,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""But record low levels of inventory will also provide support to prices, and the slowdown will be gradual.""

1549,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Confidence Falls in June,"Investing.com - Confidence among U.S consumers fell in June, according to data released on Tuesday.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence decreased to 126.4 this month, compared to a reading of 127.6 forecast by economists.
May’s reading was revised up to 128.8 from the initial 128.0.
The Present Situation Index was relatively flat, 161.1 versus 161.2 last month, while the Expectations Index declined from 107.2 last month to 103.2 this month.
The index looks at U.S. consumer’s views of current economic conditions and their expectations for the next six months. The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
The cutoff date for the preliminary results was June 15.
Despite the decline, Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said that consumers’ assessment of present-day conditions was relatively unchanged, suggesting that the level of economic growth remains strong.
“While expectations remain high by historical standards, the modest curtailment in optimism suggests that consumers do not foresee the economy gaining much momentum in the months ahead,” she added."
1550,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 01:34PM ET</span>","Rebound in South powers U.S. new home sales, dampens prices","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased more than expected in May as transactions in the South surged to near an 11-year high and dampened prices, but the overall housing market remained constrained by a dearth of properties for sale.
The housing shortage has been worsened by rising material costs as well as a lack of land and skilled labor. Housing is lagging other sectors of the economy and is not expected to contribute to economic growth in the second quarter.
""The upward trend in the new home sales data contrasts with the signals from many other recent housing indicators, which have turned weaker lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We still think that real residential investment will be close to flat in second quarter.""
New home sales jumped 6.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 689,000 units last month, the highest level since November 2017, the Commerce Department said on Monday. Last month's surge in new home sales unwound April's drop.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which make up 11 percent of housing market sales, rising only 0.7 percent to a pace of 667,000 units in May.
Sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, rebounded 17.9 percent to a rate of 409,000 units in May, the highest level since July 2007. The increase ended two straight months of declines. 
Sales tumbled 10.0 percent in the Northeast and dropped 8.7 percent in the West. They were unchanged in the Midwest. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They increased 14.1 percent from a year ago. New home sales are getting a boost from an inventory crunch in the market for previously owned houses.
A report last week showed existing home sales falling for a second straight month in May.
Supply has trailed strong demand for housing, which is being driven by a robust labor market, leading to a sharp increase in home prices. Economists say high mortgage rates so far do not appear to be diminishing demand.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 4.57 percent last week and has risen more than 50 basis points this year. Further increases are likely after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates earlier this month for a second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes by the end of the year.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) dropped sharply on Monday, tracking a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Stocks on Wall Street tumbled as investors worried about escalating tensions between the United States and its trade partners.
The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. 
MEDIAN PRICE FALLS
The median new house price fell 3.3 percent to $313,000 in May from a year ago. That was the lowest price in a year and the result of sales being concentrated in the South. House prices are generally lower in that region.
There were 299,000 new homes on the market in May, up 1.0 percent from April. Supply is just over half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom in 2006.
""At current levels and controlling for population growth, we're building roughly 2.7 homes for every 10,000 Americans – well below historic averages from the 1980s and 1990s of about 4.2 homes per 10,000 residents,"" said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow in Seattle. 
Builders are struggling with higher lumber prices as well as labor and land shortages. A survey last week showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dipped in June, with builders ""increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are hurting housing affordability.""
The Trump administration in April 2017 imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.
Residential investment contracted in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the April-June period are as high as a 4.7 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter. 

At May's sales pace it would take 5.2 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.5 months in April. Nearly two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Business confidence in Germany fell in June to its lowest in more than a year, suggesting the mood among company executives is darkening as the world edges toward a full-blown trade war.
Activity declined in all four sectors measured by the Munich-based Ifo institute in Monday's survey - manufacturing, services, trade and construction.
The readings added to signs that Europe's biggest economy is cooling after a strong 2017, though economists said a recession was not on the cards.
Ifo said its business climate index fell to 101.8, the lowest level since May 2017 and just beating a Reuters consensus forecast of 101.7. The index has now fallen in six of the last seven months.
""The boom is over... The discussion about a trade war ...is weighing on the mood. Uncertainty has increased slightly,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters. 
The institute said the June reading was taken before a row over migration broke out within Germany's governing coalition that one economist called potentially more damaging than the tariff dispute.
Observers predicted the economy would continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than last year's 2.5 percent.
""The modest fall reaffirms our ...narrative of an economy slowing to a normal growth level,"" Uwe Burkert of LBBW bank wrote in a note. ""This is however no downturn and certainly no recession.""
Much of the German data published this year has pointed to a cooling economy.
Industrial activity and exports were weak in the first four months, and U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to impose hefty tariffs on car imports from Europe - a trade that Germany dominates - on top of earlier unilateral duties on metals.
Business leaders are worried that a parallel trade confrontation between Washington and Beijing could harm German exporters who rely on the world's two largest economies for growth.
'NEVER COUNT GERMANY OUT'
Of potentially greater concern is a row over immigration within Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative alliance that has unsettled her coalition government three months after it took office.
The Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), is threatening to impose entry restrictions at the border with Austria if she fails to secure a deal to distribute migrants more fairly among European countries at an EU leaders' summit this week.
Merkel conceded that leaders had failed to find a joint solution to the issue in emergency talks on Sunday.
ING Diba economist Carsten Brzeski said German could easily weather existing U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel, and ""even significant U.S. import tariffs on cars might not affect demand, particularly if the euro remains weak.""
But should the migration row cause Merkel's government to collapse and trigger a snap election, more serious economic damage was likely.
""For the economy, this would mean further delays of the urgently needed investments, new structural reforms and strengthening of the (European) monetary union,"" said Brzeski.

But in reference to the underperforming national soccer team's last-minute victory in Saturday's World Cup match against Sweden, he added: ""Never count out Germany. Hope dies last, even if it takes until the very last second.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - An unexpected plunge in Canada's retail sales in April, combined with flat inflation figures for May, drove the Canadian dollar to a year-low on Friday and cut expectations of an interest rate increase next month.
Statistics Canada said retail sales in April dropped 1.2 percent, their biggest fall in more than two years, in part because of bad weather that hit sales of autos and gardening equipment. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast no change.
Inflation remained at 2.2 percent in May, the fourth consecutive month it has exceeded the Bank of Canada's 2.0 percent target. Markets though had expected 2.5 percent.

""I think it's fairly unambiguous that both numbers came in very much on the disappointing side,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The central bank has raised rates three times since July 2017 and until the data, around 69 percent of market operators expected a hike on July 11. That slipped to just under 50 percent after Wednesday's releases. 
The bank says it will focus closely on monthly economic statistics to guide its decision.
""Today's bad data make it even more difficult for the Bank of Canada to hike rates in July,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.
""But, with the most important numbers yet to come in, GDP and employment, there's still time for the data to turn,"" he said in an interview.
The news quickly pushed the Canadian dollar to a one-year low of 1.3384 to the U.S. dollar, or 74.72 U.S. cents, down from 1.3279, or 75.31 U.S. cents, before the data was released. It later rebounded somewhat.
Five of the eight major components in the inflation index grew at a slower rate than they had in April.
Energy prices rose, however, by 11.6 percent from May 2017 - higher than the year-on-year 6.3 percent increase in April - thanks largely to a 22.9 percent jump in gasoline prices.
All three of the central bank's core inflation measures came in at 1.9 percent. These include CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance.

""It is certainly is going to raise questions in their mind. It is going to make it a closer meeting"" as to whether to raise rates on July 11,"" said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The preliminary reading of the Markit services purchasing managers’ index came in at 56.5 this month, down from 56.8 in May.
Economists had forecast a reading of 56.4.
The manufacturing PMI rose to 54.6 in June, compared to 56.4 a month earlier.
Analysts had expected a reading of 56.3.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, fell to 56.0 this month from 56.6 in May.
The consensus forecast was looking for a drop to 55.1.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Despite the drop in the composite index, IHS Markit said that “U.S. private sector firms experienced a strong end to the second quarter of 2018, driven by another robust contribution from service providers.”
“In contrast, manufacturing production growth slowed for the second month running, to its weakest since September 2017,” the research group indicated.
IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson highlighted that even with June’s slowdown, the second quarter was the best in three years.
According to his calculations, economic growth picked up from the 2.3% registered in the first quarter to an expansion well over 3%.
Williamson did note that price pressures remained elevated due to a mix of rising fuel prices and tariff-related price hikes, as well as supplier’s gaining pricing power as demand outstrips supply for many inputs.
This expert also commented that the risks are tilted to the downside for the coming months with business expectations for the year ahead at a five-month low, led by the weakest degree of optimism in manufacturing for nearly one-and-a-half years.
“For the first time this year, factory output is growing faster than order books, suggesting production maybe adjusted down in coming months,” this expert warned, adding that inflows of new business into the service sector had cooled to the weakest since January.
“Finally, although employment is still rising strongly, even here there are signs of weakness, with the latest rise in payrolls being the lowest for a year,” Williamson concluded."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth likely put in a decent performance in the second quarter with private businesses growing faster than expected in June, but trade worries knocked manufacturing growth to the weakest in 18 months, a private survey showed.
News of faster overall expansion this month, including in two of its biggest economies Germany and France, along with rising price pressures will likely be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank. 
Just last week the ECB signaled that its crisis-era bond buying program will end this year and that interest rates will rise in the second half of 2019.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic growth, climbed in June to 54.8 from 54.1 in the previous month and above 53.9 predicted in a Reuters poll. 
The latest PMIs suggest 0.5 percent euro zone growth in the second quarter, IHS Markit said. That is below the 0.6 percent predicted in a Reuters poll taken last month, but above 0.4 percent measured in the first three months of the year.
Analysts said while this was a step in the right direction, there was no reason to declare the recent slowing trend is over. Accordingly, there was not much movement in the euro when the initial data were released.
""The increase in the PMI shows that calendar effects may have overstated the slowdown in May, but it doesn't provide much evidence that the soft patch has ended,"" noted Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING. 
""While not a fantastic result, the release does provide a silver lining to the current streak of disappointing data from the eurozone.""
The composite output price index climbed to a four-month high of 53.8 from 53.2. That followed news last week that official euro zone inflation rose to 1.9 percent in May, very close to the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.
The survey covering the bloc's dominant service industry rose to 55.0 from 53.8 in May, the highest since February, and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which predicted a dip to 53.7.
Optimism also increased among services firms and they increased hiring at the fastest pace in over a decade. The employment index climbed to 55.2 from 53.9, the highest since late 2007.
""All in all, today’s data will reassure the ECB that it is right to be winding down its asset purchase program this year,"" noted Jessica Hinds, European economist at Capital Economics. 
But euro zone consumer morale dropped unexpectedly in June, according to separate flash data from the European Commission.
TRADE TENSIONS STARTING TO HURT
Manufacturing growth eased in June, in part on increasing fears of a trade war, with the flash factory PMI down to 55.0, its weakest in 18 months, from 55.5 in May.
The factory output index fell to a 19-month low of 54.3 from 54.8 in May, with the new factory orders index down to a 22-month low of 53.3 from 54.2.
""Manufacturing is looking especially prone to a further slowdown in coming months, with companies citing trade worries and political uncertainty as their biggest concerns. Sentiment about the year ahead in the factory sector has sunk to its lowest since 2015,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, in a release.
U.S. President Donald Trump's latest threats on tariffs have exacerbated already elevated tensions over trade, including with the European Union.
Trade barriers now being put up could soon push central banks to cut their growth projections. ECB chief Mario Draghi sounded a note of concern at its annual gathering this week in Sintra, Portugal.

""It's not easy and it's not yet time to see what the consequences on monetary policy of all this can be, but there's no ground to be optimistic on that,"" Draghi said.

The manufacturing PMI fell to 55.0 from 55.5 a month earlier. The reading was in line with forecasts.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose to 54.8 from 54.1, against expectations for 53.9.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
“An improved service sector performance helped offset an increasing drag from the manufacturing sector in June, lifting Eurozone growth off the 18-month low seen in May,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
Williamson said the data suggested growth of 0.5% in gross domestic product for the second quarter.
He also indicated that price pressures were also on the rise again, running close to seven-year highs.
He explained that increases in oil and raw material prices were driving up costs, but wages were also lifting higher.
While Williamson noted that jobs in the services sector were being created at the fastest rate in the past decade, but warned that business expectations were running at one-and-a-half year lows while output continued to increase at a faster rate than incoming new orders.
This expert also warned that manufacturing was looking especially prone to a further slowdown in coming months, with companies citing trade worries and political uncertainty as their biggest concerns. Sentiment about the year ahead in the factory sector has sunk to its lowest since 2015.
“While the June upturn provides some hope that the weakening of official data earlier in the year may have overstated the region’s weakness, the risks remained tilted towards a further slowdown in the second half of the year,” Williamson concluded."
1565,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",BOJ tankan set to show manufacturers' confidence receding for second straight quarter: Reuters poll,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence among big Japanese manufacturers was expected to decline for a second straight quarter in June as higher costs, an export slowdown, and U.S. trade activism heightened corporate caution.
A Reuters poll of 17 economists found on Friday that the Bank of Japan's tankan survey report was expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence worsening by two points to plus 22 in June.
The tankan's sentiment index for big non-manufacturers was expected to stay steady in June, supported by solid construction investment and brisk demand from foreign visitors, but higher oil prices and rising labour costs would weigh on the outlook. 
The index of big non-manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 23, unchanged from March survey.
""Corporate earnings are on a rising trend thanks to recovery in the domestic and overseas economies,"" said Yasunari Tanaka, economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute. 
""But things such as escalating U.S. protectionism and a slowdown in shipments of electronic parts and devices sent the manufacturers' sentiment down slightly, but staying at a high level.""
The poll found the big manufacturers' business outlook was expected to worsen slightly to plus 20 and that of non-manufacturers was seen slipping to plus 22. 
Big corporations were seen as likely to be raising their capital spending plans by 9.3 percent for the fiscal year that started in April, increasing from 2.3 percent in the March survey.
""Manufacturers are expected to invest in upgrading their ageing facilities and their appetite for investment for robots and Internet of Things is seen rising,"" said Asuka Sakamoto, economist at Mizuho Research Institute. 
Investment demand for automation because of labour shortages is seen growing and capital spending ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020 will continue to be high, she added. 
The Bank of Japan will release its tankan survey results at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday July 2. (2350 GMT on July 1).
The monthly Reuters' Tankan, which tracks the BOJ's tankan quarterly survey, showed Japanese manufacturers' confidence improved for a second straight month in June but the service sector's mood slumped.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
Japan's factory output was expected to fall 1.1 percent in May, down for the first time in four months, as production of transport machinery declined and inventories of electronic parts and devices were adjusted, the poll showed.
""Underlying production is not necessarily weak. We expect factory output will rebound in April-June,"" an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities said in the survey.
The trade ministry will issue factory output data at 8:50 a.m. on Friday June 29 Japan time (2350 GMT on June 28). 
Next week's labour market figures are expected to show unemployment steady at 2.5 percent in May with the jobs-to-applicants ratio unchanged at 1.59, its highest since January 1974.
The Tokyo area's core consumer price index comes out a month earlier than the national data and is expected to show a rise of 0.6 percent from a year ago in May, inching higher from a 0.5 percent in April, the poll found.
Higher electricity and gasoline prices were expected to support the index, but the prices of other items remained weak, analysts said.

The internal affairs ministry will announce the core CPI for Tokyo and jobs market data at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 08:51PM ET</span>","Japan flash June manufacturing PMI rises, but new export orders contract","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in June at a faster pace than the previous month but export orders contracted for the first time in almost two years in a warning sign about overseas demand, a preliminary survey showed on Friday.
The flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.1 in June from a final 52.8 in May.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 22nd consecutive month.
""The final PMI reading of the second quarter revealed a quickened pace of growth across the Japanese manufacturing economy,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""That said, for the first time since August 2016, new export orders declined. With geopolitical risk aplenty, haven demand for the yen remains a downside risk to the country's manufacturing exporters,"" he said.
The preliminary index for new export orders fell to 49.5 from 51.1 in May, showing the first decline in 22 months, in a worrying indication that trade protectionism and currency-market moves could hurt Japan's export-focused economy. The yen has strengthened about 2 percent against the dollar this year.
In spite of the contracting export orders, the flash index for output rose to 53.4 in June from a final 53.1 in the previous month, in a sign of strength in the manufacturing sector.
Japan's economy is expected to rebound in the second quarter from a contraction the first quarter that ended the longest growth streak since the 1980s bubble economy.
Risks to Japan's outlook abound. The United States and China are embroiled in a trade dispute that pits the world's two largest economies against each other.
Retaliatory tariffs could disrupt global supply chains for the tech and auto industries, sectors heavily reliant on outsourced components.
Japan is vulnerable, some economists say, as it ships electronics and car parts to China that are used to make finished goods destined for other markets.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 11:46AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; mid-Atlantic manufacturing cools,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a further tightening of labor market conditions. 
Other data on Thursday showed a moderation in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in June amid a decline in new orders. Firms, however, continued to report overall increases in employment this month. 
The robust labor market, which is underpinning economic growth, likely will pave the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates two more times this year. The U.S. central bank last week increased borrowing costs for a second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes by the end of 2018.
""The U.S. labor market is tightening,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist a Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Though unemployment benefits claims are not a perfect measure of layoffs, they highlight the strength of the labor market and suggest the unemployment rate has nowhere to go but lower.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended June 16, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week. Claims have now declined for four straight weeks.
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Fed's forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street fell amid lingering concerns over the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, dropped 4,000 to 221,000 last week.
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of June's employment report. The four-week average of claims rose 7,500 between the May and June survey weeks, suggesting some moderation in job growth this month. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 223,000 jobs in May.
Economists expect hiring to slow in the coming months as employers increasingly report labor shortages across all sectors of the economy. There were a record 6.7 million job openings in April. The number of unemployed people per vacancy slipped to 0.9 from 1.0 in March, meaning that most people looking for a job are likely to find one.
HEADWINDS FORMING
The strong labor market is providing a boost to the economy, with gross domestic product estimates for the second quarter topping a 4.5 percent annualized rate. But the growth pace could slow later this year. 
A separate report from the Conference Board showed its leading economic index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent in May after increasing 0.4 percent in April. The Conference Board said the index ""indicates that economic activity is not likely to accelerate."" 
A third report from the Philadelphia Fed also appeared to hint at a growth slowdown. The Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index fell to a reading of 19.9 in June, the lowest level since November 2016, from 34.4 in May. 
Economists speculated the ebb in business conditions was the result of escalating tensions between the United States and its trade partners, including Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The Trump administration has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to shield domestic industries from what it says is unfair competition. Washington also plans to impose duties on a range of Chinese imports next month.
""There may be some headwinds forming,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""There is a lot of chaos in Washington that is causing optimism to moderate.""
The Philadelphia Fed survey's new orders sub-index tumbled to a reading of 17.9 this month from 40.6 in May. Firms also reported order backlogs were diminishing. They continued to report higher prices for both raw materials and their own manufactured goods.
A measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region edged up to a reading of 30.4 this month from 30.2 in May. But manufacturers reduced hours for their employees, with the average workweek index decreasing 10 points. 

Firms were less upbeat about business prospects over the next six months, with measures for new orders and employment declining. Manufacturers, however, expect to boost capital expenditures in the next six months.

While the Commission did not give details on the reason for the deterioration, protectionist talk by the United States administration and fear of a trade war with China and the European Union have spooked markets worldwide.
The downward pressure on economic growth in the quarter is also a headache for policy makers at the European Central Bank set to end a stimulus program by the year-end.
The Commission said a flash estimate showed euro zone consumer morale dropped to -0.5 in June from +0.2 in May. This was below expectations of a decline to 0.0 in a Reuters poll of 30 economists.
In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment fell to -1.3, the Commission added.
Last week, output at euro zone factories for April showed a larger than expected decrease. Next Thursday, business confidence data for the euro zone as well as for the bloc's largest economy Germany will be released.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>","Taiwan's central bank keeps rates on hold, export orders top forecasts","By Liang-Sa Loh and Jess Macy Yu
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank left its policy interest rate unchanged on Thursday, with robust export orders helping to keep the economy on a solid growth path even amid China-U.S. trade tensions.
Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long said after his second policy rate meeting that the impact of current global trade tensions on the island would be minimal. 
The central bank kept the benchmark discount rate at 1.375 percent, where it has remained for eight quarters, as widely expected. 
The trade-reliant economy, though hit by recent market volatility, has more monetary policy flexibility than some of its emerging market peers facing pressure to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in shifting from low interest rate settings.
Taiwan can better fend off capital outflows as investors seek higher yielding assets due to its large current account surplus and substantial foreign exchange reserves. 
Thirteen out of 17 economists in a Reuters poll had predicted it would stand pat again on Thursday.
Capital Economics said in a report it did not believe the central bank would be in any rush to adjust monetary policy as Taiwan's economy was still expanding at a decent pace. 
""External factors probably weighed little on the decision today, given the Taiwan dollar's resilience amidst the recent (emerging market) currency sell-off,"" it said. 
The central bank revised up full-year economic growth to 2.68 percent from 2.58 percent forecast in March and said it would maintain appropriate loose monetary policy to support growth. 
Taiwan had cut its policy interest rate four times in a row from late 2015 to help lift the economy out of a mild recession.
But growth momentum has been strong since then, underpinned by a global technology boom that has benefited its manufacturers. 
A steady expansion prompted the government to raise its 2018 GDP forecast to 2.6 percent in May from 2.42 percent previously.
Earlier on Thursday, data showed Taiwan's export orders grew a faster-than-expected 11.7 percent in May thanks to strong orders from China, although some analysts said they expect the strong momentum will be difficult to sustain.
""If there is a further escalation in China-U.S. trade tensions, we believe the weakness may not be limited to the semiconductors segment because China's exports to the U.S. require a sizeable portion of Taiwanese intermediate and capital goods exports,"" ANZ said in a research note. 
Financial markets are worried about an open trade conflict between Washington and Beijing after three rounds of high-level talks since early May failed to reach a compromise on U.S. complaints over Chinese practices and its record deficit with China. 
A Sino-U.S. trade war could disrupt global supply chains for the tech and auto industries, sectors heavily reliant on outsourced components, and derail world growth.
The United States and China are Taiwan's top export markets. 
Taiwan's central bank said it expects 2018 core CPI to be down at 1.16 percent. 
In minutes released in May, one central bank board member had said that if CPI growth was more than 2 percent in the next few months, it would consider adjusting interest rate policy.

Consumer prices in May rose 1.64 percent from a year earlier, easing from April's 1.98 percent.

The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee was split on the decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5% with three out of nine members voting in favor of a quarter point increase.
BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane joined Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty to vote in favor of a rate hike. It was the first time a BoE chief economist has dissented since 2011, fueling expectations for an August rate hike.
Officials are now more confident that a slowdown in the first quarter is temporary, the bank said in its rate statement. Household spending and sentiment have bounced back strongly and inflation is expected to pick up slightly more than expected in the near-term.
All MPC members agree that future rate increases are likely to be gradual and limited and that any reduction in quantitative easing will be conducted at a ""gradual, predictable pace,"" the bank said.
The central bank updated its guidance about when it might start unwinding its stimulus program, saying this could come once rates have reached around 1.5%, sooner than previous 2% guidance.
The pound rallied after the announcement, with GBP/USD climbing 0.3% to 1.3210, up from a seven-month low of 1.3102 reached earlier.
The economy is expected to grow by 0.4% in the current quarter after slowing to near stagnation in the first three months of the year.
That slowdown saw the BoE hold off on an expected rate increase last month and prompted investors to rethink their expectations about how fast borrowing costs will rise.
At its May meeting the BoE said it wanted to signs of stronger economic growth before it prepared to raise interest rates, but economic data has been mixed since then.
Inflation has fallen to a one-year low and wage growth has slowed, but retail sales have picked up and the dominant UK services sector is showing signs of bouncing back after a recent slowdown.
BoE Governor Mark Carney was to give what would be a closely watched speech outlining the outlook for the economy and its preparedness for Brexit later Thursday."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell for the second straight month in May as an acute shortage of properties on the market pushed house prices to a record high.
The sales decline, which was reported by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) on Wednesday, indicated the housing market was continuing to lag a strong economy and would likely not contribute to growth in the second quarter. 
Home sales have largely treaded water this year as strong demand depletes the supply of properties on the market, causing house prices to rise faster than wages.
For U.S. Mortgages interactive graphic click http://tmsnrt.rs/1SQgDJa
The median house price increased 4.9 percent from a year ago to an all-time high of $264,800 in May. In contrast, annual wage growth has been stuck below 3 percent even as the unemployment rate has dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. 
""Supply is woefully inadequate to meet demand, which is pushing prices ever higher and contributing to mounting affordability woes,"" said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow in Seattle. ""It's hard to tell if, when and how this cycle gets broken.""
Existing home sales slipped 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.43 million units last month, the NAR said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales rising 1.5 percent to a rate of 5.52 million units in May.
Last month, sales rose in the Northeast, but fell in the West, South and Midwest. Existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, dropped 3.0 percent on a year-on-year basis in May. They have declined on that basis for three straight months. 
Supply has been especially tight at the lower end of the market, which accounts for a large portion of the housing market. According to the NAR, sales of homes priced below $100,000 plunged about 18 percent in May from a year ago. 
With mortgage rates rising back to seven-year highs, purchasing a home could become even more expensive for first-time buyers. Mortgage rates could rise further after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week for a second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes before the end of 2018.
May's weak sales suggested less in brokers' commissions in the second quarter, leading economists to trim their gross domestic product estimates for the April-June period by one-tenth of a percentage point. Second-quarter growth estimates are above a 4.5 percent annualized pace. 
The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the first quarter, with residential investment contracting.
U.S. Treasury yields rose after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank should continue with a gradual pace of rate increases. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher while the dollar (DXY) hovered near 11-month highs against a basket of currencies.
HOT MARKET
There were 1.85 million previously-owned homes on the market in May, down 6.1 percent from a year ago. Supply has declined for 36 straight months on a year-on-year basis. The pipeline of foreclosures has also dried up, with distressed sales making up a record low 3 percent of transactions last month.
At May's sales pace, it would take 4.1 months to exhaust the current housing inventory, up from 4.0 months in April. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 26 days in May, matching April's seven-year low and slightly down from 27 days a year ago. Fifty-eight percent of homes sold in May were on the market for less than a month.
First-time buyers accounted for 31 percent of transactions in May, down from 33 percent in both April and May 2017. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market. 
Builders have struggled to plug the inventory gap, citing higher prices for lumber as well shortages of land and labor. At the same time, Americans are staying longer than 10 years in their first home. There is, however, cautious optimism that the inventory squeeze will ease by the end of this year.
The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that housing starts increased 5.0 percent to a rate of 1.350 million units in May. Housing completions increased 1.9 percent to a rate of 1.291 million units last month.
Some economists believe rising mortgages could lead to a slowdown in demand that might solve the supply problem.

""The upward trend in mortgage rates will pull affordability below a critical point and start to seriously erode demand and appreciation, at which point the reduced return on homes as an asset will prompt more homeowners to sell, breaking the tight market fever,"" said Andres Carbacho-Burgos, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Existing home sales fell 0.4% in May from the previous month to an annualized pace of 5.43 million units.
Economists had forecast a 1.5% increase to an annualized pace of 5.52 million.
Existing home sales account for 90% of the market and are calculated when a contract closes.
NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun indicated that ""a solid economy and job market should be generating a much stronger sales pace than what has been seen so far this year.""
Yun pointed out that closings were down in a majority of the country last month and declined on an annual basis in each major region.
Regarding prices, the report showed that median existing-home price for all housing types in May was $264,800, up 4.9% from May 2017 ($252,500). That was an all-time high and the 75th straight month of year-over-year gains in prices.
""Incredibly low supply continues to be the primary impediment to more sales, but there’s no question the combination of higher prices and mortgage rates are pinching the budgets of prospective buyers, and ultimately keeping some from reaching the market,” he explained."

Domestic home sales and construction have remained resilient this year despite higher mortgage rates, more expensive lumber and shortages of land and labor.
U.S. housing starts neared an 11-year peak in May at an annualized pace of 1.350 million units, while building permits fell 4.6 percent, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
The Washington-based mortgage industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on filings for home loans rose to 384.1 in the week ended June 15. This was up 5.1 percent from a week ago, marking the largest percentage gain since a 8.3 percent jump in the week of Jan. 5.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" home loans, whose balances are $453,100 or less, averaged 4.83 percent, matching the prior week's level, the MBA said.
The average rate on 30-year loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, which are often used by first-time home buyers or borrowers with patchy credit, dipped to 4.82 percent from 4.83 percent the previous week.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on loan applications to buy a home, a proxy on future housing activity, rose 4.3 percent last week to 259.6, a two-month high.

The group's seasonally adjusted barometer on requests to refinance an existing home loan increased to 1,052.3, up 6.1 percent, the biggest rise in three months.

The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened by $8.0 billion to $124.1 billion, or 2.5 percent of national economic output, in the first three months of the year.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to widen to $129.0 billion from the previously reported $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department said a tax overhaul passed by Congress in December 2017, which offered a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings, led many companies to bring back cash parked abroad. 

Companies paid out dividends and other withdrawals of $305.6 billion from foreign receipts, the department said, which far outstripped the amount of this cash which was reinvested domestically.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Business confidence among Asian companies slipped for the first time in three quarters, on mounting worries that U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies would trigger tit-for-tat reprisals and undermine the global trading system.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index, representing a six-month outlook from 61 firms, fell to 74 in the second quarter from a seven-year high of 79 in the prior three months. The survey was conducted over June 1-15.
While a reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook, this is the first time the number has dropped since September 2017.
The risks to growth are increasingly real now, said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD. ""Trade war is not a risk but a reality,"" he said.
""U.S. tariffs are going up against China but also against some of its traditional allies, such as Canada and the European Union. They are all about to retaliate and today we do not see an easy way out,"" Fatas said.
Trump has riled key allies with his protectionist policies, including the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on the European Union, Canada and Mexico. On Monday, he threatened to hit China with new tariffs on $200 billion in goods.
""Companies can try to go around tariffs by moving production to other countries, this is costly and inefficient. It is a short-term solution but not optimal,"" Fatas said.
However, Malaysia-based RHB Banking Group's chief economist, Arup Raha, noted that some Asian economies, with strong external balance sheets, are relatively resilient to global turmoil.
""Besides, global growth, especially in the U.S. and China, is still good. Also, wage growth in Asia is signaling domestic strength,"" Raha added.
China's GDP has expanded at a steady 6.8 percent for three straight quarters, though there are concerns overly rapid credit growth and trade frictions could pose risks for the world's second-largest economy.
By industry, retail and leisure was the most bullish, while construction and engineering as well as autos were the weakest. Most sectors expressed concern about trade tensions and higher interest rates, the survey showed.
Respondents to the survey include Oil Search (AX:OSH), Hero MotorCorp (NS:HROM), Mahindra & Mahindra (NS:MAHM), Suzuki Motor (T:7269), Asahi Group (T:2502), SoftBank Group (T:9984), Metropolitan Bank & Trust (PS:MBT), SM Investments (PS:SM),  Ayala Corp  (PS:AC), Delta Electronics (BK:DELTA) and Intouch Holdings (BK:INTUCH).

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 10:29PM ET</span>",BOJ minutes: One member says more easing needed but central bank seen on hold,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - A lone Bank of Japan policymaker said additional easing was needed to accelerate inflation, but most members wanted to keep monetary policy unchanged, minutes from the central bank's policy meeting in April showed on Wednesday.
The minutes do not identify who spoke, but the call for additional easing most likely came from BOJ board member Goushi Kataoka, a reflationist economist who regularly votes against the BOJ's decisions to keep policy on hold.
Other board members are unlikely to support Kataoka because of worries over the side effects of prolonged quantitative easing, but the minutes highlight the scepticism the BOJ faces after ditching the timeframe for its 2 percent price target.
The BOJ kept policy unchanged at the April meeting but dropped the timeframe it had set for hitting its 2 percent inflation target, in a surprise move analysts say is aimed at keeping market expectations for more stimulus in check.
The minutes showed that no board member submitted a formal proposal for additional easing at the meeting in April, although one member advocated speeding up the economy by taking additional easing measures to boost inflation expectations.
Members were worried that by sticking with the forecast for when it expects to meet its inflation target the central bank could hamper communication with markets, the minutes showed, because investors were linking the forecast to changes in monetary policy. 
One member expressed concern that deleting the timeframe would weaken the BOJ's commitment to price stability.
The BOJ may lower its forecasts for consumer price growth at its next meeting in July but is likely to keep monetary policy on hold, economists say.
""The BOJ is preparing itself for a long battle, because it has basically given up on quickly achieving its price target,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities. 
""Kataoka may want to ease policy, but he cannot put this to a vote, because he knows he doesn't have any one else's backing.""
Under its monetary easing policy, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year benchmark bond yield around zero percent via heavy buying of government debt. 

Financial institutions have complained that the BOJ's policy has sucked liquidity out of the bond market and hurt bank profits.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' confidence improved for a second straight month in June but the service sector's mood slumped from May's record high level, a Reuters poll found, suggesting some fragility in the outlook after a first-quarter contraction.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found manufacturers' confidence was expected to increase over the next three months while service sector sentiment was seen holding steady.
Compared with three months ago, manufacturers' mood was slightly lower while the service sector was unchanged, indicating the BOJ's tankan due next on July 2 will likely show business confidence as largely steady.
The mixed results highlight some reservations about the health of the economy at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy raises fears of protectionism and global trade war, clouding the outlook for export-reliant Japan.
""Appetite for capital expenditure at our clients is waning in light of increasingly protectionist policies in America and China, as well as political instability in southern Europe,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey.
In the Reuters poll of 539 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 240 firms responded on condition of anonymity, managers complained about weak consumer spending, rises in oil and raw materials costs, an uncertain global outlook and labor shortages. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 26, up from 22 in May, led by industrial materials producers like oil refiners and steel makers, according to the survey conducted June 4-15.
The manufacturers' index was down two points versus three months ago. The index is expected to rise to 30 in September.
The service-sector index declined to 35 from a record high of 39 seen in the previous month, with retailers likely taking a hit from weak consumer spending.
Compared with three months ago, the service-sector index was unchanged. It is expected to hold steady in September.
The BOJ's latest tankan issued in April showed big manufacturers' confidence fell for the first time in two years as worries about gains in the yen and trade friction with the United States dimmed the outlook.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

In sync with a broader euro zone slowdown, French growth is expected to slow to 1.7 percent after hitting a decade high of 2.3 percent last year, INSEE said in its quarterly economic outlook.
""We expect French growth to still have momentum even though less than in 2017,"" the head of INSEE's forecasting unit, Julien Pouget, told journalists.
Like other euro zone countries, France saw growth slow sharply in the first quarter after a particularly strong end to 2017 as oil prices rose 23 percent and the euro gained against the dollar, making the bloc's exports more expensive.
Unlike other euro zone countries, increases in several taxes weighed on consumer spending in France at the start of the year while Airbus deliveries dropped back after an end of year surge.
After quarterly growth of only 0.2 percent in the first three months, the rate was seen rising to only 0.3 percent in the second quarter as rail and air strikes clipped 0.1 percentage points off growth.
INSEE forecast the rate would then pick up to 0.4 percent for the third and fourth quarters.
Over the course of the year, business investment was seen as the main driver of growth despite the growing specter of protectionism adding to uncertainty.
Nonetheless, the pace of job creation was seen slowing to 183,000 this year from 340,000, driving unemployment down 0.2 percentage points to 8.8 percent by the end of the year.
With the labor market improving, consumer spending was seen growing 1.0 percent this year, only marginally slower than last year, while higher inflation was expected to eat into households' purchasing power.
Boosted by higher energy prices, inflation was seen peaking at 2.3 percent this year before easing to 1.7 percent by the end of the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding surged to near an 11-year high in May amid an acceleration in both single-family and multi-family home construction, but a second straight monthly drop in permits suggested housing market activity would remain moderate.
Housing starts vaulted 5.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.350 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That was the highest level since July 2007. Data for April was revised slightly to show starts falling to a rate of 1.286 million units instead of the previously reported pace of 1.287 million units. 
Building permits fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 1.301 million units, the lowest level since September 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.310 million units last month and permits declining to a rate of 1.350 million units. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 3.9 percent to a rate of 936,000 units last month.
Single-family home construction rose in the Northeast and Midwest, but fell in the South and West. It has lost momentum since hitting a pace of 948,000 units last November, which was the strongest level in more than 10 years. 
Permits to build single-family homes fell 2.2 percent in May to a pace of 844,000 units, an eight-month low. With permits lagging starts, single-family homebuilding could slow in the months ahead.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries held at lower levels after the data. U.S. stock index futures were trading sharply lower as U.S.-China trade tensions escalated, while the dollar (DXY) was stronger against a basket of currencies.
MORE EXPENSIVE LUMBER
A survey on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dipped in June, with builders ""increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are hurting housing affordability."" According to the survey, more expensive lumber had ""added nearly $9,000 to the price of a new single-family home since January 2017.""
The Trump administration in April 2017 imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. The higher cost of lumber together with a lack of land and labor has worsened an acute shortage of homes for sale, hobbling the housing market. 
Residential investment contracted in the first quarter. The housing market continues to lag overall economic growth, which appears to be accelerating in the second quarter after hitting a speed bump at the start of the year.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment rebounded 7.5 percent to a rate of 414,000 units in May. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes fell 8.8 percent to a pace of 457,000 units.
The housing shortage could ease, with more houses under construction and being completed. Housing completions increased 1.9 percent to a rate of 1.291 million units, the highest level since January 2008. The number of single-family houses completed last month was the most since March 2008.
Realtors estimate that housing start and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

The stock of housing under construction edged up 0.2 percent to 1.127 million units, the highest level since July 2007. Single-family homes under construction last month increased 0.2 percent to 515,000 units, the highest level since May 2008.

By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Business confidence among Asian companies rose in the first quarter to the highest level in seven years, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed, as a fresh surge by the Chinese economy offset concerns about rising trade barriers.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS> , representing the six-month outlook of 67 firms, advanced one notch to 79 for the January-March quarter compared with three months before.
A reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
""The improvement is not dramatic but with a historical perspective this is a good reading,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.
Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia saw robust jumps in sentiment, showing that many countries in Asia continue to benefit from accelerating global growth. In particular, China has seen exports soar, up 45 percent in February to mark their fastest growth in three years. 
""China ... has escaped the fear of a crisis that started back in 2016 and that's why you see strong confidence. Imbalances persist but there is no real threat of a crisis over the short term,"" said Fatas.
The subindex for Thailand surged to 100 from 85 and the Philippines saw a climb to 83 from 70 while sentiment in Malaysia improved five notches to 75. 
""The tourism and export sector expansion will help drive growth (in Thailand) this year,"" said Rattham Somboonchareon, a planning manager at survey respondent  Thai Airways  (BK:THAI), adding that government spending was also a key driver of growth.
Australia's subindex dropped to 80 from 92, although the figure is relatively high when compared with its historical average of 69.
While the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have raised their global growth forecasts for this year due to strong trade, consumer spending, and investment in many major economies, intensifying rhetoric in favour of protectionism has become a major concern.
U.S. President Donald Trump has announced import tariffs on steel and aluminium, and is expected to consider additional tariffs targeted specifically at China. He has also repeatedly said the U.S. free-trade deal with South Korea is ""unfair"" and has threatened to scrap it altogether on multiple occasions.
That has battered sentiment in South Korea, with the country's subindex plunging to 50 from 83.
""There is a sense among Korean businesses that Trump will continue to be aggressive against their country,"" said Fatas.
Singapore's subindex declined to 75 from 79. The country's exports took a surprise dip in February as tech product shipments continued to retreat from the hot pace of recent months.
Japan, where consumer spending numbers have been subdued, recorded its lowest reading in a year, at 67 compared to the fourth-quarter's 70. India also experienced a decline in sentiment, falling to 72 from 79.
The index for sentiment in China increased to 88 from 83, but the number of respondents was low at four companies.
Increasing trade friction and higher interest rates were cited as the biggest concerns in the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey.
By industry, the technology, construction, energy and metals sectors expressed concern about trade friction, showed the survey, which was conducted March 2-16.
Sectors which identified rising interest rates as a risk included the energy, real estate, retail and technology sectors. The energy sector also showed concern about the potential for a sudden asset price correction.
The retail and leisure sector recorded its best ever reading. Healthcare had its highest score in two years.

1586,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Homebuilder Sentiment Fell in June on Higher Lumber Costs,"(Bloomberg) -- Sentiment among U.S. homebuilders fell in June to match the lowest level this year, reflecting sharply elevated lumber costs, according to a report Monday from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo.
Key Takeaways
Tariffs on lumber and other imported materials are making construction more expensive, which in turn limits affordability for prospective buyers, according to the NAHB. Higher lumber prices have added nearly $9,000 to the price of a new single-family home since January 2017, the Washington-based group said. Lumber prices rose to a record in May.
Higher mortgage rates, a shortage of affordably-priced listings, and soaring property values have also made purchases less attractive, especially for people entering the market for the first time. Even so, while the index has fallen in five of six months this year, developers’ confidence isn’t far from an 18-year high reached in December: A strong job market, bigger after-tax paychecks and improving finances are supporting demand.
Official’s View
“Builders are increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are hurting housing affordability,” NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom-home builder from Louisiana, said in a statement. At the same time, “builders are optimistic about housing market conditions as consumer demand continues to grow.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose in May at the fastest rate in four months thanks to increased shipments of cars, car parts, and semiconductor equipment, a sign that global demand is gaining strength. 
Exports rose 8.1 percent in May from the same period a year ago, more than the median estimate for a 7.5 percent annual increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. In April, exports grew an annual 7.8 percent.
Exports are likely to continue to grow thanks to increased demand for manufacturing equipment, cars and car parts, but Japan's trade surplus with the United States makes it a potential target for U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies.
Japan's exports to the United States rose 5.8 percent year-on-year in May, faster than a 4.3 percent year-on-year in April, due to higher shipments of car parts.
Imports from the United States rose 19.9 percent year-on-year as imports of U.S. aircraft and coal grew.
As a result, Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 17.3 percent year-on-year to 340.7 billion yen ($3.08 billion), the lowest such surplus since January 2013.
The decline in the trade surplus with the United States is unlikely to exempt Japan from White House criticism as President Donald Trump's administration raises tariffs to lower the U.S. trade deficit and combat what it says are unfair trade policies.
Trump is pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, and China's Commerce Ministry has said it would respond with tariffs ""of the same scale and strength,"" sparking fears of a full-blown trade war.
Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which affect Japanese companies, and has also criticized Japan for its low level of imports of American vehicles. ""Exports will continue to recover, but I am a little worried about the pace of growth,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Friction between the United States and China on trade policy could impact Japan. This is a risk factor for Japan and for global trade.""
In terms of volume, which strips out the impact of currency moves, Japan's exports rose an annual 4.2 percent in May versus a 4.6 percent annual increase in the previous month.
Japan's overall imports rose 14.0 percent in the year to May, versus the median estimate for an 8.2 percent increase, due to the rising price of oil. 
The trade balance was a deficit of 578.3 billion yen ($5.23 billion), versus the median estimate for a 235.0 billion yen deficit.

The BCC cut its 2018 growth forecast to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent -- in line with the average in a Reuters poll of economists published on June 7 -- and also cut its outlook for 2019 to 1.4 percent.
""The economy is in a torpor, with uncertainties around Brexit, interest rate rises, and international developments such as a possible trade war and rising oil prices all having an impact,"" the BCC said.
Britain was the slowest-growing among the G7 group of major economies at the end of 2017, and in the first three months of 2018 the economy expanded by just 1.2 percent year-on-year, its weakest since 2012.
The Bank of England expects the economy to pick up after its weak start and achieve growth of 1.4 percent this year, rising to 1.7 percent in 2019 when Britain leaves the European Union.
But the BCC said the slow start to 2018 looked like it was down to more than just unusually icy weather, and added that the case was weak for a further increase in BoE rates, which most economists expect in August.
On Friday, Germany's Bundesbank cut its forecast for growth this year to 2.0 percent from 2.5 percent, blaming trade war fears and political instability in parts of the euro zone.

The preliminary publication of the data for June from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment rose to 99.3 from 98.0 a month earlier.
Analysts had forecast an increase to just 98.5.
The current conditions indicator increased to 117.9 in June, from the previous 111.8.
Economists had projected that the index would rise to 113.0.
Additionally, consumer expectations unexpectedly decreased to 87.4 in June, from the previous 89.1.
That missed consensus that had expected a rise to 89.7.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months increased to 2.9% from 2.8%, while the five-year gauge rose to 2.6% from the previous 2.5%.
The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin indicated that sentiment rose due to consumers' more favorable assessments of their current financial situation and more favorable views of current buying conditions for household durables.
However, expectations declined to its lowest level since the start of the year due to less favorable prospects for the overall economy.
“The sharpest divide was between the record number of households who mentioned recent income gains and the highest expected year-ahead inflation rate since 2015,” Curtin commented.
“At some point in every economic expansion, favorable income and job prospects act to offset higher inflation and interest rate expectations. Only when inflation and interest rates are expected to persistently exceed income and job prospects will consumers begin to curtail their discretionary spending,” he explained.
However, Curtin predicted that ""the continued small declines that are now anticipated in the unemployment rate, as well as more robust gains in household income, will bolster real personal consumption expenditures during the year ahead.”"

Overall industrial output fell 0.1 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production rising 0.2 percent. The U.S. central bank's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
May's decline was driven by a 0.7 percent fall in manufacturing, the largest monthly decline since January 2014, with the largest drops including a 6.5 percent fall in motor vehicles and parts and 2 percent decreases in primary metals and apparel. April's reading was upwardly revised to show a 0.6 percent gain. 
Mining production was up 1.8 percent and utilities output rose 1.1 percent. 
Overall manufacturing output rose at an annual rate of 1.7 percent through May, while the index for mining surged 12.6 percent on a 12-month basis and utilities rose 4 percent in that period. 
With overall output falling in May, the percentage of industrial capacity in use fell 0.2 percentage points to 77.9 percent.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 06:53PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending accelerating; labor market robust,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in May as consumers bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods even as they paid more for gasoline, the latest indication of an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter.
Other data on Thursday showed a further tightening in labor market conditions, with first-time applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly falling last week and the number of Americans on jobless rolls declining to a near 44-1/2-year low.
The reports came a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a second time this year and offered an upbeat assessment of the economy. The U.S. central bank described economic activity as ""rising at a solid rate"" and the labor market as continuing to ""strengthen."" The Fed forecast two more rate hikes in the second half of 2018.
""In short, the Fed was right to upgrade its assessment of economic growth to 'solid' in yesterday's statement,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 0.8 percent last month, the biggest advance since November 2017. Data for April was revised up to show sales rising 0.4 percent instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent gain. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.4 percent in May. Retail sales in May increased 5.9 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.5 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent increase in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have risen 0.5 percent in April. 
The strong retail sales report added to data ranging from the labor market to manufacturing and trade in suggesting the economy was regaining momentum in the second quarter after growth slowed at the start of the year amid a sharp step-down in consumer spending. 
Based on the core retail sales data for April and May, economists said consumer spending was so far in the second quarter rising at an annualized rate of at least 3.5 percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at an anemic 1.0 percent pace in the first quarter.
Another Commerce Department report showed a rebound in business inventories in April. Following Thursday's data growth estimates for the April-June quarter were raised to as high as a 4.8 percent rate, which would be the best performance in four years. 
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies also as the European Central Bank signaled it would hold rates low through mid-2019. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were higher.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
Retail sales are being underpinned by a $1.5 trillion income tax cut, which economists said was helping to blunt some of the hit to household budgets from pricey gasoline. A robust labor market is also lifting wage growth, supporting spending.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended June 9.
Economists had forecast claims rising to 224,000 in the latest week. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 49,000 to 1.70 million in the week ended June 2, the lowest level since December 1973. 
""The claims data suggest that the labor market is healthy and that job growth will remain strong,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The labor market is considered to be close to or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year. It is near the Fed's forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
Layoffs have remained very low amid signs of growing worker shortages across all sectors of the economy. There were a record 6.7 million job openings in April. The number of unemployed people per vacancy slipped to 0.9 from 1.0 in March, indicating that most people looking for a job are likely to find one.
Retail sales in May were buoyed by a 0.5 percent rise in receipts at auto dealerships. Auto sales rose 0.2 percent in April. Sales at service stations surged 2.0 percent last month, reflecting higher gasoline prices. 
Prices at the pump have risen by 15.5 percent this year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. 
Building material store sales rebounded 2.4 percent last month after declining 0.8 percent in April. Receipts at clothing stores surged 1.3 percent, the largest gain since March 2017.
There were also hefty gains in sales at restaurants and bars as well as general merchandise stores, but receipts at furniture stores fell 2.4 percent, the largest drop since December 2013.

Consumers also continued to cut back on spending on sports and hobbies.

The French economy was seen growing 1.8 percent this year instead of the 1.9 percent previously forecast in March and down from 2.3 percent registered last year.
Growth was expected to ease as corporate and household investment returned toward more normal levels after a particularly strong surge last year, the Bank of France said.
The central bank said that higher oil prices would weigh on the outlook though the impact would in part be offset by slightly firmer global demand.
The Bank of France raised its inflation forecast to 2.0 percent this year from 1.6 percent previously due to higher energy prices, which it said would also weigh on household spending.
Looking out past this year, the central bank forecast growth of 1.7 percent next year and 1.6 percent in 2020, leaving its estimates unchanged.
Meanwhile, inflation was seen falling back next year to 1.5 percent next before rising to 1.8 percent in 2020. 

The economy was seen steadily adding close to 200,000 jobs annually, driving the unemployment rate from 9.2 percent at the start of this year to 8.2 percent by the end of 2020, the lowest level since 2008.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday business inventories increased 0.3 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in March. Business inventories were previously reported to have been unchanged in March.
April's rise in inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product, was in line with economists' expectations. Retail inventories increased 0.5 percent in April instead of gaining 0.6 percent as reported in an advance estimate published last month.
Retail inventories fell 0.7 percent in March.
Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.7 percent in April and not 0.6 percent as reported last month. Auto inventories declined 0.9 percent in March.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.4 percent in April rather than the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. They fell 0.6 percent in March.
Inventory investment added just over one-tenth of a percentage point to the economy's 2.2 percent annualized growth pace during the January-March period. Economists expect the pace of inventory accumulation to remain moderate in the second quarter.
Business sales rose 0.4 percent in April after increasing 0.6 percent in March. At April's sales pace, it would take 1.35 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from March.

1601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>","U.S. Retail Sales Top Forecasts, Bolstering Economic Pickup","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales rose in May by the most in six months, exceeding forecasts and bolstering expectations for an acceleration in economic growth this quarter.
The value of overall sales advanced 0.8 percent from the prior month, double the median estimate of economists and following an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in April, according to Commerce Department figures on Thursday. So-called retail control-group sales -- a key measure that excludes food services, auto dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations -- rose 0.5 percent, also exceeding projections.
The results added to signs that lower taxes, elevated confidence and a strong labor market are helping to cushion the blow to Americans’ wallets from higher fuel expenses. Solid gains in household purchases -- the biggest part of the economy -- and steady business investment are among reasons growth is projected to regain momentum in the second quarter.
“This suggests a pretty strong rebound in second-quarter growth,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). “Retail sales were pretty strong across the board,” he said, adding that “we’re relatively optimistic that this could continue going forward. Consumers will be able to absorb higher gasoline costs, especially with the tax cuts kicking in.”
Estimates for retail sales in the Bloomberg survey ranged from unchanged to a 0.6 percent gain. Excluding purchases of autos and gasoline, sales climbed 0.8 percent, also the most since November and topping projections.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 to a five-week low of 218,000 last week, adding to signs of a tight job market. Continuing claims for two weeks ago dropped to 1.7 million, the lowest since December 1973.
The strong labor market and solid economic growth are among reasons why Federal Reserve policy makers raised interest rates Wednesday for the second time this year and projected two more hikes in 2018. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News earlier this month saw gross domestic product expanding at a 3.3 percent pace this quarter, up from 2.2 percent in the previous three months.
Clothing Stores
Ten of 13 major retail categories showed monthly gains in May, according to the Commerce Department data. Clothing stores had their biggest advance in more than a year at 1.3 percent and building-materials vendors saw a 2.4 percent rise, the most since September, when demand got a boost from post-hurricane rebuilding.
The only sectors to show declines were furniture and home furnishings, with a 2.4 percent drop -- the most since 2013 -- along with sporting goods and hobby stores and food and beverage sellers.
The Commerce Department figures aren’t adjusted for price changes, so higher gasoline expenses boosted retail sales, which can be volatile from month to month. Filling-station receipts in May increased 2 percent, the most since November, reflecting a jump in fuel prices that are near the highest level since 2014.
While costlier fuel leaves people with less money to buy other goods and services, the latest results suggest Americans are benefiting from steady job and wage gains, along with lower taxes enacted by the Trump administration.
Purchases at automobile and parts dealers rose 0.5 percent, consistent with recent reports that showed May vehicle sales were surprisingly strong, with gains at automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales jumped for a second month in a row in May, far outstripping expectations as a royal wedding and warm weather helped shoppers put a winter slump further behind them, data showed on Thursday.
The figures pushed up the value of sterling as investors took them as a sign that the economy was recovering from a sharp slowdown in the wintry start to 2018 which put the Bank of England off an interest rate hike.
Retail sales volumes rose by more than all forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll, jumping by 1.3 percent in monthly terms and following an upwardly revised 1.8 percent bounce-back in April, the Office for National Statistics said.
Supermarkets and other retailers said shoppers spent more on food and household goods before the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the middle of the month, the ONS said.
Brian Hilliard, an economist with  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said the data should be weighed against weaker figures for manufacturing and construction output in April published earlier this week.
""There is still some tension in trying to reach the second-quarter growth of 0.4 percent that the Bank of England predicts,"" he said.
In the three months to May, sales rose by 0.9 percent compared with a 0.2 increase in the three months to April, a period which included heavy snowstorms and unusually cold temperatures, the ONS said.
Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes were up 3.9 percent, the biggest rise in more than a year and again above all forecasts in the Reuters poll.
Last week, figures from British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard suggested sales in May rose sharply. 
The BoE expects consumers to feel the benefit of a fall in inflation and rising wages after suffering a squeeze on their spending power last year when the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote pushed up prices sharply.
However, it held off from raising rates at its May meeting as it waited to be sure that Britain's economy was recovering from its early 2018 slowdown.
Data published earlier this week suggested that the recovery has been slow - factories had their worst month in five-and-a-half years in April and the pace of growth in wages slowed.
The still weak finances of many households, combined with the rise of online shopping, has hammered many retailers.
Chains such as Marks & Spencer  (L:MKS) and House of Fraser have been forced to shut stores as consumers shop online for cheaper goods and other retailers have gone out of business.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy is finally starting to cool under the weight of a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending that is pushing up borrowing costs for companies and consumers, with data on Thursday pointing to a broad slowdown in activity in May.
China's central bank sparked concerns over the health of the economy earlier in the day when it left short-term interest rates unchanged, surprising markets which had expected it to follow a hike by the Federal Reserve, as it has tended to do.
Industrial output, investment and retail sales all grew less than expected, suggesting further weakness ahead if Beijing perseveres with its crackdowns on pollution, questionable local government spending and off-balance sheet ""shadow"" financing. 
The data, which showed the slowest investment growth in over 22 years, ""was all shockingly weak by Chinese standards,"" economists at Rabobank said, adding that the readings may explain the central bank's decision to keep rates on hold. 
""Get ready for headlines talking about Chinese deleveraging hitting the economy – except it isn't even deleveraging yet! China is walking more of a tightrope than markets believe – and the data underline that issue clearly,"" they said.
China has been walking a fine line between rolling out measures to curb financial risks and pollution and tapping the brakes so hard that business activity slows sharply.
Much of their effort so far has focused on the banking sector rather than corporate debt reduction or deleveraging - possibly explaining why China's headline growth has been so surprisingly solid. GDP has expanded at a steady 6.8 percent for three straight quarters.
But official and unofficial gauges are now showing the regulatory crackdown is starting to filter through to the broader economy, with companies complaining it is harder to get financing and a growing number of firms defaulting on bonds.
China's fixed-asset investment (FAI) growth cooled to 6.1 percent in January-May from the same period a year earlier, the slowest pace since at least February 1996.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to remain steady at 7.0 percent, the same as in January-April. 
Growth in infrastructure spending, a powerful economic driver last year, slowed to 9.4 percent in the first five months, from 12.4 percent in January-April. 
""The biggest drag on FAI here is infrastructure investment,"" said senior China economist Betty Wang at ANZ. 
But Wang noted there are still many infrastructure projects in the pipeline, and it is a relatively easy sector for the government to inject stimulus if it chooses.
""Sure, local governments are more restrained by the crackdown on debt, but if there is a very large downside risk to the economy, the government is fully capable of propping it up again.""
May industrial output rose 6.8 percent from a year earlier, versus estimates for a small dip from April's 7 percent.
CONSUMPTION SLOWING?
Retail sales grew 8.5 percent in May, the slowest since June 2003, according to Reuters calculations. Analysts had expected a slight pick-up to 9.6 percent.
The slowdown was due to seasonal factors and consumers delaying purchases, Mao Shengyong, a spokesman at the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters.
Auto sales dipped 1 percent. China's auto industry said on Monday that some car buyers were holding off on purchases, presumably until import tariffs are cut from July 1.
Mao said the economy will maintain relatively sound momentum in the second half, and was confident it will grow around 6.5 percent for the full year, in line with the government's target and Reuters polls.
But the writing is on the wall for slower activity in coming months after data early this week showed overall credit growth cooled.
Private sector investment, which accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China, also cooled.
TRADE A BRIGHT SPOT BUT U.S. THREATS LOOM
Trade was one of the few bright spots in May data, but analysts expect exports may also lose momentum in coming months amid rising trade tensions with the United States.
Chinese exporters have been front-loading their shipments due to changes in the international trade environment, commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday.
A third round of Sino-U.S. trade talks early this month ended with few signs of progress, as Beijing warned that any trade and business deals reached with Washington would be void if it implemented tariffs.
On Friday, Washington is expected to release a list of some $50 billion worth of Chinese goods that will be subject to a 25 percent tariff. But it is not clear when U.S. President Donald Trump would activate them, if he chooses to do so. 
GRADUAL SLOWDOWN SEEN, NOT HARD LANDING
Following Thursday's data, ING cut its estimate for China's second-quarter GDP growth 6.7 percent from 6.8 percent, bringing it more in step with other forecasters.
Oxford Economics and Nomura kept their views unchanged at 6.4 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively. Commerz Bank also held steady, saying its 6.4 percent estimate is ""already low"".
While much of the May data was softer, readings also showed the key property sector was generally holding up, suggesting the economy will slow only a modest pace.
Property investment growth eased in May, but a construction boom which began in 2016 may still be going strong. Data from the China Construction Machinery Association showed the sales of excavators doubled in May from a year earlier. 
Indeed, property sales and construction starts both picked up last month, with analysts saying cash-starved developers may be rushing out projects to reduce their financing pressures. 
""Current economic growth still remains relatively steady, so I'm not sure whether monetary and financial policies will change overnight in response,"" said Yang Yewei, analyst at Southwest Securities.
""But I think after July and August the downward pressure in the economy may increase significantly and policy adjustments will happen then.""

1610,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 12:11AM ET</span>","China May Industrial Output, Retail Sales Miss Expectations ","Investing.com – China’s May industrial output and retail sales both missed expectations, while fixed-asset investment’s growth in the first five months were also well below forecasts, official data showed on Thursday.
Industrial output grew 6.8% year-on-year in May, missed expectations of a 6.9% growth, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.
Industrial output, officially called industrial value added, is used to measure the activity of designated large enterprises with annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (about 3 million U.S. dollars).
Meanwhile, Retail sales rose 8.5% from a year earlier, versus the general consensus of an increase of 9.6% and compared with a rise of 9.4% in April.
Fixed-asset investment growth also slowed to 6.1% in the first five months, well below the forecasts of 7.0%, which was the same pace as in January-April.
On the other hand, private sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.1%, compared with an increase of 8.4% in the first four months. 
Economists expect China's GDP to ease to around 6.5% in 2018, from 6.9% in 2017, according to reports from Reuters earlier this year.
U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his top trade advisers later this week to discuss whether to activate tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods, a senior Trump administration official said on Wednesday.
Citing people familiar with the revisions, reports on Thursday suggested the list might be slightly smaller than the initial tariff list which targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods.
“China could be a little bit upset about trade because we are very strongly clamping down on trade,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News."
1611,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",China property sales pick up as developers push projects to market,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's real estate investment growth slowed in May but remained firm, with sales growth hitting a near one-year high, defying fresh purchase curbs and higher financing costs and indicating resilience in one of the country's main economic drivers.
Property investment rose 9.8 percent in May from the same period a year earlier, compared with a 10.2 percent rise in April, according to Reuters calculation based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. It grew 10.2 percent in the first five months of the year.
The figure mainly focuses on residential real estate but also includes commercial and office space.
Real estate directly affects about 40 business sectors in China and is a major driver for the economy. But a market boom has raised bubble concerns and prompted more than 100 cities to take measures to tame soaring home prices.
In a sign of growing confidence among property developers, new construction starts measured by floor area rose 20.5 percent in May from a year earlier, picking up from 2.9 percent in April, Reuters calculations showed.
Property sales by floor area rose 8 percent in May on-year, the fastest pace since June 2017 and turning around from a 4.1 percent drop in April, as transaction volume in smaller cities climbed.
""The jump in sales may largely be due to more financing pressure faced by property developers, so they are looking to push more projects into the market for funds despite price caps on new launches,"" said Joe Zhou, head of research for commercial property agency JLL China.
The mild slowdown in investment reflected slower construction, but developers' appetite for land and transactions remained high, with buyer demand picking up in smaller cities.
Major Chinese property developers such as  Country Garden  (HK:2007) and  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) have reported solid sales growth for the first five months of this year. 
The data comes even as slew of smaller cities in China rolled out fresh tightening measures in May aimed at containing fast-rising property prices.
At the same time, more provincial capitals are allowing out-of-towners to qualify as local property buyers, bypassing local buying restrictions, through a new campaign that seeks to attract skilled labor.
In year-to-date terms, property sales rose 2.9 percent in the first five months.
In May, China's housing ministry issued two express warnings about the current market rebound and vowed to step up checks on local government efforts to rein in home prices and hold accountable those cities that failed to do so.
New household loans, mostly mortgages, rose 16 percent in May from April, accounting for 53.4 percent of total new loans from 44.8 percent.
But analysts noted other developers have struggled to refinance debt as official efforts to tighten domestic credit in the housing market hampered access to funds.

""In the longer term, I think developers are not that optimistic and investment and sales will slow on tighter financing,"" said JLL's Zhou.

1612,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",Australian Jobs Show Weakness Even as Unemployment Rate Falls,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s unemployment declined in May as fewer people sought work, signaling a slightly weaker labor market.
The jobless rate fell to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent in April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Thursday. While that was better than the 5.5 percent median forecast of economists, it was a result of a decline in the workforce participation rate. Overall, the economy added 12,000 jobs last month, lower than forecast and all part-time.
“There is still plenty of slack in the labor market,” said Kate Hickie at Capital Economics Ltd., noting high underutilization. “As such, even if the pace of job creation picks up again in the coming months, this excess slack and other structural forces are likely to prevent wage growth from increasing much.”
Australian central bank officials say strong forward indicators are likely to herald a renewed upswing in hiring and expect the jobless rate to fall toward 5 percent, a level that traditionally spurs wage growth. That in turn would drive faster inflation and clear the path for the nation’s first interest rate increase in eight years.
Still, traders only expect such a scenario to unfold over time, currently pricing in the first tightening in November 2019. A jump in labor force participation last year absorbed blockbuster job gains and kept unemployment around 5.5 percent. In other details:
“Businesses are still keen to cut costs where they can rather than lifting prices,” said Craig James, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s securities unit. “Interest rates will remain on hold until there is firm evidence that skill shortages are leading to broader-based increases in wages, and therefore higher selling prices.”
"
1613,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Australia May jobs growth misses expectations as full-time employment falls,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment rose by less-than-expected in May with gains led wholly by part-time work while the jobless rate ticked down to its lowest since November, a mixed outcome that points to tepid wages growth.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released on Thursday showed the unemployment rate eased to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent in April. It has remained between 5.4 percent and 5.6 percent for almost a year now.
According to some estimates, Australia's labor market will be considered at or near full employment when the jobless rate falls to 5 percent or lower.
""A key reason why the unemployment rate isn't falling even more is because more people are entering the job market in the search for work. Workforce participation is just off record highs,"" said CommSec chief economist Craig James.
The participation rate dipped a bit to 65.5 percent from 65.6 in April, but has stayed near levels seen in 2011 as more women and senior citizens entered the labor force.
Overall, 12,000 net new jobs were added in May, below expectations of 18,000. Annual job growth of about 3 percent was almost double the U.S. pace of job creation of 1.6 percent.
But the breakdown of the May series was less encouraging, with a 32,700 surge in part-time jobs when full-time work plunged by 20,600. April full-time work was also downwardly revised to show a gain of 28,000 from a 32,700 increase earlier.
With labor supply expanding to meet demand, there is less upward pressure on wages and inflation and thus no near-term trigger for a rise in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
""Rates will remain on hold until there is firm evidence that skill shortages are leading to broader-based increases in wages, and therefore higher selling prices,"" CommSec's James said.
The RBA last cut rates to a record low 1.5 percent in August 2016 and is seen likely to keep policy unchanged for another year. <0#YIB:>

Data out last month showed annual wage growth was a feeble 2.1 percent in the March quarter, half the rate enjoyed by workers during the decade-long mining boom that began in the early 2000s.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' (RICS) house price balance rose to -3 from -7 in April, once again dragged down by a weak market in London and echoing other measures of British house prices.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a lesser improvement to -5.
A measure of new properties coming on to the market turned positive for the first time in 27 months.
However, RICS said its survey was consistent with a generally flat month for price changes and inventory levels remained near record lows.
""Against this backdrop, it is likely that the headline picture regarding activity in the housing market will remain subdued for some months to come,"" Simon Rubinsohn, RICS's chief economist, said.
Britain's housing market has cooled since the 2016 Brexit vote which led to a rise in overall inflation and increased uncertainty among investors.

London's housing market remained a weak spot in May with surveyors reporting that the capital was the only area of the country where prices were expected to fall over the next 12 months.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Gasoline leads broad increase in U.S. producer inflation,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in May, leading to the biggest annual gain in nearly 6-1/2 years, the latest sign of a gradual building up of inflation pressures.
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a second time this year on Wednesday and forecast two more rate hikes. The U.S. central bank noted that overall and underlying inflation measures had moved closer to its 2 percent goal.
""The Fed is on the right course with its gradual pace of rate hikes because the inflation heat may yet lead to fire and the risk that monetary policy has to move faster and put the long economic recovery in jeopardy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.5 percent last month, boosted by a surge in gasoline prices and continued gains in the cost of services, the Labor Department said. The PPI edged up 0.1 percent in April. In the 12 months through May, the PPI increased 3.1 percent, the largest advance since January 2012. Producer prices rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in April. 
Economists had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3 percent from the prior month and rising 2.8 percent from a year ago.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services nudged up 0.1 percent last month. The so-called core PPI rose by the same margin in April. In the 12 months through May, the core PPI rose 2.6 percent after advancing 2.5 percent in April.
The renewed upward trend in producer prices strengthens expectations that inflation will pick up this year. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.8 percent year-on-year in April after a similar gain in March. 
New projections from Fed officials on Wednesday indicated that the core PCE price index would slightly run above the 2 percent target.
The dollar reversed losses against a basket of currencies following the Fed's rate decision while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street fell marginally.
STEEL PRODUCTS PRICES SURGE
Regional factory surveys have shown an acceleration in raw material prices this year. So far, manufacturers have not passed on these higher costs to consumers. A worsening worker shortage is expected to push up wages. This together with expensive raw materials will likely squeeze profit margins and probably force businesses to raise prices. 
A report on Tuesday showed monthly consumer prices rising moderately in May.
In May, prices for goods surged 1.0 percent, accounting for 60 percent of the rise in the PPI. Goods prices were unchanged in April. In May, they were boosted by a 9.8 percent jump in the price of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices slipped 0.4 percent in April. 
Prices for steel mill products surged 4.3 percent in May, the largest rise since February 2011, likely reflecting steel and aluminum import tariffs imposed in March by the Trump administration. The cost of these products could rise further after the government this month widened the duties to imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
""The inflation impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs, though likely moderate, will be more visible in the second half of this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Wholesale food prices edged up 0.1 percent last month after declining 1.1 percent in April. Excluding food and energy, goods prices increased 0.3 percent, rising by the same margin for a third straight month.
The cost of services increased 0.3 percent after nudging up 0.1 percent in April. Services were driven by a 0.9 percent rise in margins for trade services. 
The cost of healthcare services ticked up 0.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in April. Those costs feed into the core PCE price index. Economists said factoring in the PPI and CPI data, they expected the monthly core PCE price index rose 0.2 percent in May, which would push the annual increase to 1.9 percent.
""Medical care pricing looked weak in May, but we see firmness in other inputs related to used vehicle prices, airfares, and prices for various financial services,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The Commerce Department will publish May PCE inflation data on June 29.

The Federal Open Market Committee increased the overnight funds rate to a range of 1.75% to 2.00%.

""The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" The Federal Reserve said in a statement.
Futures traders had seen an around 92.5% chance of a rate increase ahead of the meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Members of the rate-setting committee raised their 2018 median forecast for interest rates to 2.4% from a previous estimate of 2.1%, hinting at an additional two rate hikes in 2018. The interest-rate outlook for 2019 was raised to 3.1% from 2.9% in March while 2020's was left unchanged at 3.4%.
""While that move in the median reflected only one participant moving their outlook, it is likely that several of the more influential Committee members now anticipate two second-half hikes,"" JPMorgan said.
In a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy, members of the rate-setting committee raised their economic growth projection for this year, forecasting U.S. economic growth of 2.8% in 2018, a 0.1% increase from the previous projection of 2.7% in March.
The Federal Reserve also raised its outlook on inflation, forecasting Core-PCE inflation outlook for 2018 at 2.0%, up 0.1% from the previous forecast. While Core-PCE Inflation for 2019 and 2020 was left unchanged.
The central bank's upbeat outlook on inflation comes as figures on Tuesday showed that annual inflation rose by 2.8% in May, while core or underlying inflation rose by 2.2% year-over-year.
According to the minutes from the Fed’s May policy meeting, policymakers are less concerned about inflation rising above the Fed’s 2% target than they are about the rate of inflation dipping again.
The labor market is expected to tighten further in 2018, with the unemployment rate expected at 3.6%, down from a prior forecast of 3.8%. The central bank forecasts the unemployment rate for both 2019 and 2020 at 3.5%, down from 3.6% previously.

The weak industrial output numbers add to a string of data signaling the euro zone economy is slowing. It also highlights the conundrum facing the ECB on how to exit its large bond- buying program, known as quantitative easing (QE).
Ending the purchases is a given. The key question at the ECB's Thursday meeting is how it will guide markets on the expected path of interest rates.

Production of energy, durable and non-durable goods as well as intermediate goods fell in the month. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected a decline of 0.5 percent.
Only the production of capital goods, such as machinery, rose in April.

The Office for National Statistics reported that the annual rate of inflation rose by 2.4% in May, unchanged from the previous month, which was a one year low and in line with expectations.
Rising motor fuel prices produced the largest upward contribution to inflation, the ONS said.
There were also large upward effects from air and sea fares, which rose between April and May this year, but fell between the same two months a year ago, influenced by the timing of Easter.
Underlying inflation rose by 2.1% on a year-over-year basis, matching the previous month and also in line with forecasts.
Consumer prices rose 0.4% in May, unchanged from a month earlier and in line with forecasts.
The inflation figures were the latest indication that a cost of living squeeze in the UK is easing, even after data on Tuesday showing that wage growth slowed slightly in the three months to April.
The steep drop in sterling in the wake of the June 2017 Brexit referendum drove up the cost of imports, leading to a spike in inflation. Although it has pulled back from its November peak of 3.1%, it is still running above the BoE’s target of 2.0%.
With inflation falling back towards the BoE’s target and economic and wage growth cooling markets are taking the view that a rate hike by the BoE in the coming months is becoming increasingly less likely.

Treasury reported a budget deficit of $88 billion in the same month last year, the department's monthly budget statement showed.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury recording a $144 billion deficit in May.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, the government's deficit was $131 billion compared to an adjusted deficit of $88 billion in the same month in the previous year.
Economists caution that the Trump administration's corporate and individual tax cuts along with an increase in government spending will drive up the country's deficit despite a robust economy in which the unemployment rate has fallen to an 18-year low.
The deficit for the fiscal year, which began last October, was $532 billion, compared to a deficit of $433 billion in the same period of fiscal 2017. On an adjusted basis, the gap was $584 billion compared with $473 billion in the prior period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly consumer inflation rose moderately in May as gasoline price increases slowed, suggesting the Federal Reserve could continue to gradually raise interest rates this year. 
The Labor Department's inflation report was published ahead of the start of the Fed's two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Steadily rising inflation and a tightening labor market are seen encouraging the U.S. central bank to hike rates for a second time this year on Wednesday.
""Neither too hot nor too cold,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""As such, today's news won't change the terms of the inflation debate, and is likely to do little to stir the pot at the Fed meeting."" 
The Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month, also as food prices were unchanged. That followed a similar gain in the CPI in April. In the 12 months through May, the CPI accelerated 2.8 percent, the biggest advance since February 2012, after rising 2.5 percent in April.
The surge in the annual CPI is largely the result of last year's weak readings, which were driven by big declines in the prices of cell phone service plans and doctor fees, falling from the calculation.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2 percent, supported by a rebound in new motor vehicle prices and a pickup in the cost of healthcare, after edging up 0.1 percent in April. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core CPI to 2.2 percent, the largest rise since February 2017, from 2.1 percent in April. 
The Fed tracks a different inflation measure, which is just below its 2 percent target. Economists are divided on whether policymakers will signal one or two more rate hikes in their statement accompanying the rate decision on Wednesday.
""The slow but steady upward pressure on inflation could tilt a majority of policymakers to lift their suggested interest rate forecast, possibly penciling in two additional moves in the second half of the year after almost certainly raising rates tomorrow,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell slightly. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
INFLATION ON THE HORIZON
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in April, matching March's increase. Economists expect the core PCE price index will breach its 2 percent target this year. 
Fed officials have indicated they would not be too concerned with inflation overshooting the target. 
A survey by the NFIB on Tuesday showed the share of small businesses reporting raising prices hitting it highest level since 2008 in May. Several regional factory surveys have shown manufacturers paying more for raw materials this year.
Economists expect these higher costs will eventually be passed on to consumers. That, together with an expected acceleration in wage growth from a tight labor market could boost inflation later this year. The unemployment rate is at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent.
""There is inflation out there on the horizon but it is largely a mirage policymakers think will disappear when the economy gets there,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Last month, gasoline prices increased 1.7 percent after surging 3.0 percent in April. Food prices were unchanged in May after rising 0.3 percent in the prior month. Food consumed at home fell 0.2 percent amid declines in the cost of meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3 percent in May after a similar gain in April. 
Healthcare costs gained 0.2 percent last month, with prices for prescription drugs jumping 1.4 percent and the cost of hospital visits rising 0.5 percent. Healthcare costs nudged up 0.1 percent in April. Prices for new motor vehicles rose 0.3 percent after sliding 0.5 percent in April. 

But prices for used cars and trucks fell 0.9 percent after tumbling 1.6 percent in April. Airline fares declined 1.9 percent in May after dropping 2.7 percent in the prior month. Prices for apparel and recreation were unchanged in May.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 09:25AM ET</span>","Spend more at home, OECD tells Germany as investor mood darkens","By Joseph Nasr and Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors is at its darkest in years with a tariff attack on the county's exports largely to blame, a survey showed, as one global economic body said the solution lay in spending more at home.
The ZEW research institute's sentiment index fell to -16.1 in June from -8.2 in May, it said on Tuesday - the lowest reading since September 2012 and missing a consensus forecast of -14.0 in a Reuters survey.
Weighing on morale were concerns about the new Italian government's commitment to the euro zone, but of potentially far greater immediate economic impact was a festering trade dispute with the United States.
Washington's allies have warned that protectionist policies espoused by President Donald Trump - including punitive import tariffs on steel and aluminum - are weakening the world economy.
But as Europe's biggest exporter to the United States - a trade relationship that keeps more than one million Germans in employment - Berlin is more anxious than most to avoid a trade war with Washington.
ZEW president Achim Wambach said the dispute was leaving its mark on the economic outlook, and falls in German exports, industrial output and orders in April also suggested a long sustained recovery could be flagging.
But the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said on Tuesday the upswing remained strong and the government should use its budget surplus to increase investment.
""Your current account got fat because you won productivity and competitiveness compared to the others in Europe. Now, does that give rise to protectionists? Of course!"" OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria told reporters in Berlin.
""So basically, you could spend more, yes! You could import more, yes!""
Germany's has faced similar criticism from the International Monetary Fund and its euro zone partners, and Trump has partly justified his tariffs by pointing to the U.S. trade deficit with Germany.
But he stunned a broader constituency of U.S. allies at the weekend when he backed out of a joint G7 communique in Canada that mentioned the need for ""free, fair and mutually beneficial trade"" and the importance of fighting protectionism.
DRIVEN HARD
While the United States also runs a trade deficit with the EU as a whole, the impact of protectionist moves risks being particularly acute for Germany, with a car industry heavily reliant on transatlantic trade particularly vulnerable.
Trump has threatened to use national security laws to impose tariffs on car and truck imports.
German carmakers are also struggling to shake off an emissions scandal that has dented their reputation and could cost billions of euros to refit diesel vehicles with greener exhaust filters.
The ZEW survey was taken in the two weeks running up to Monday, which could mean concerns about Italy were more prominent in some respondents' minds.
The new government in Rome comprises anti-establishment parties with a brief to shake up EU institutions, though its economy minister said at the weekend the country was committed to the single currency.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions dropped to 80.6 from 87.4 last month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for 85.0.
""On the face of it, the ZEW index suggests ...(a German) recession is a significant risk,"" Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics wrote in a note.
""But note that its past relationship with GDP growth has been very weak and we would not draw any firm conclusions from a particular level,"" she adding, predicting economic growth of around 2 percent up to end-2019.
That chimes in with an early-June consensus among economists that a consumption-driven upswing will continue and, with financial markets showing no discernible reaction to Tuesday's data, that view appears not to have shifted significantly.
The OECD predicted German growth of 2.1 percent this year and next.

Gurria said Germany should take criticism of its persistently large current account surplus seriously and address the imbalances it caused.

1627,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>","U.S. Inflation Accelerates to Six-Year High, Eroding Wages","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation accelerated in May to the fastest pace in more than six years, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s outlook for gradual interest-rate hikes while eroding wage gains that remain relatively tepid despite an 18-year low in unemployment.
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent from the previous month and 2.8 percent from a year earlier, matching estimates, a Labor Department report showed Tuesday. The annual gain was the biggest since February 2012 and follows a 2.5 percent increase in April. Excluding food and energy, the core gauge was up 0.2 percent from the prior month and 2.2 percent from May 2017, also matching the median estimates of economists.
The pickup in headline inflation partly reflects gains in fuel prices, though the annual gain in the core measure -- seen by officials as a better gauge of underlying inflation trends -- was the most since February 2017. While the Fed is widely projected to raise borrowing costs this week for the sixth time in 18 months, the path of inflation will figure into policy makers’ thinking on the pace of increases for the second half and in 2019.
The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation -- a separate consumption-based figure from the Commerce Department -- came in at the central bank’s 2 percent goal during March and April, and the figure tends to run slightly below the Labor Department’s CPI. At the same time, several Fed officials have indicated that a modest overshoot of the inflation goal wouldn’t necessarily warrant faster interest-rate hikes, after years of below-target price gains.
A separate Labor Department report on Tuesday illustrated how higher prices are pinching wallets: average hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, were unchanged in May from a year earlier, even as nominal pay accelerated to a 2.7 percent annual gain from 2.6 percent in April. For production and nonsupervisory workers, real average hourly earnings fell 0.1 percent from a year earlier.
Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices rose 1.7 percent in May from the previous month, after a 3 percent gain in April.
The shelter category, which accounts for about one-third of the CPI, rose 0.3 percent from the previous month, continuing a trend of steady increases. Owners-equivalent rent, one of the categories designed to track rental prices, advanced 0.2 percent. Lodging away from home, which includes hotel and motel rates, rose 2.9 percent in May, the most since August.
Investors see the Fed as on track to raise interest rates at its two-day meeting that starts later on Tuesday in Washington, while policy makers will issue updated forecasts showing whether they expect one or two hikes in the second half. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent in May, matching the lowest in 48 years and signaling the central bank is nearing its maximum-employment goal.
Commerce Department figures released May 31 showed the Fed’s separate preferred gauge of inflation met policy makers’ target in April for the second straight month as U.S. consumer spending rose by the most in five months. The preferred core index was up 1.8 percent from the prior year.

1628,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 08:32AM ET</span>",U.S. Inflation Rises 2.8% in May,"Investing.com - U.S. inflation accelerated more than expected in May, underlining the case for a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.
Consumer price inflation rose by an annualized 2.8% in May the Labor Department said, up from 2.5% in the previous month. The consensus forecast was for a reading of 2.7%.
Month-on-month, CPI rose 0.2% in May, matching the previous month’s increase and in line with the consensus forecast.
Core CPI, a key gauge of underlying consumer price pressures that excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.2% from a month earlier, above the consensus forecast for growth of 0.1%.
In the 12 months through June, core CPI rose 2.2%, compared to 2.1% a month earlier. Economists were looking for a gain of 2.2%.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Inflation remains a central concern for markets as increasing price pressures would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently forecast.
Markets widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% when it announces its decision on Wednesday.
The U.S. central bank will also release new forecasts for economic growth and interest rates. The question is whether its rate hike projections - three moves both this year and next - move up and whether it expects to hit the so-called neutral interest rate quicker than earlier thought.
According to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, the odds of an additional hike in December, for a total of four in 2018, have recently been hovering just above 40%."

ATHENS (Reuters) - A protracted downturn in Greece's residential property market slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2018, central bank data showed on Tuesday, raising hopes that prices were starting to respond to a recovering economy.
Property accounts for a large chunk of household wealth in Greece, which has one of the highest home ownership rates in Europe - 80 percent versus a European Union average of 70 percent, according to the European Mortgage Federation.
Apartment prices fell by 0.2 percent in the first three months of 2018 from a year earlier, Bank of Greece data showed, decelerating from a 1.9 percent decline in last year's first quarter.
In all of 2017, prices slid 1.0 percent from a year earlier, the data showed. That took the cumulative fall since 2008, when the country's protracted recession began, to 42 percent.
The market has been hit by property taxes imposed to plug budget deficits, a tight credit market and a jobless rate still hovering above 20 percent - the highest in the 19-nation euro zone.
Apart from undercutting household wealth, falling property prices also affect collateral values on banks' outstanding real estate loans.
The price slide has gradually eased from 10.8 percent in 2013 to 2.4 percent in 2016 and 1.0 percent last year, with economists expecting prices to level out soon.
""The data confirm the stabilization trend in the property market,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas. ""We expect the trend to continue with a pick-up in growth helping to drive prices to positive terrain in the coming quarters.""
Greece's economic prospects improved after it signed up to a third bailout package worth up to 86 billion euros ($107.3 billion) three years ago.

Its 180-billion-euro economy expanded for a fifth straight quarter through March this year and at a faster pace than in the previous quarter, helped by stronger exports.

Inflation in May alone was 110 percent, according to the assembly's calculations, amid an economic crisis in which millions of Venezuelans are suffering from shortages of food and medicine. 
Venezuela's central bank has not published inflation data for more than two years.
According to the assembly's calculations, Venezuela entered hyperinflation, for which the benchmark is usually a 50 percent monthly inflation figure, at the end of 2017.
The opposition blames the hyperinflation on strict currency controls, enacted 15 years ago by former President Hugo Chavez, as well as excessive money printing. The bolivar currency is down some 98 percent against the dollar in the last year alone, meaning Venezuela's minimum wage is equivalent to just a handful of U.S. dollars a month.

President Nicolas Maduro, who won re-election in a May 20 vote deemed a sham by critics, has blamed the super-high inflation rate on an alleged economic war directed from Washington.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 11:17AM ET</span>",Shock manufacturing slide casts doubt on UK economy's bounceback,"By Andy Bruce and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British factories had their worst month in five-and-a-half years in April, suggesting the economy's weak start to 2018 has persisted and lowering the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates again any time soon.
Sterling slid as data showed the biggest fall in factory output since 2012 due to tepid demand at home and abroad.
The Office for National Statistics also said Britain posted its biggest trade deficit since September 2016.
""The rebound in GDP as a whole in Q2, if there is one, could be pretty subdued and it certainly questions the likelihood of another rate increase in August,"" Investec economist Philip Shaw said. 
Britain's economy slowed sharply last year, even as much of the rest of the world picked up speed, as the 2016 Brexit vote left consumers with higher inflation and companies turned cautious about investment. Things got worse in early 2018 but the BoE said the slump was probably mostly due to cold weather.
Monday's figures did little to support comments last week by BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden who said data until that point suggested the economy's weak start to 2018 would probably prove temporary. 
The BoE is looking for evidence that the economy is on a firmer footing before it resumes raising rates.
Britain's economy probably grew only 0.2 percent in the three months to May, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank said.
Manufacturing output dropped by 1.4 percent in April after a 0.1 percent decline in March, the biggest month-on-month fall since October 2012, the ONS said.
The decline was bigger than any of the predictions in a Reuters poll of economists, and reflected lower production of steel for use in infrastructure and electrical machinery. 
EXPORT WORRY
Higher oil production limited the monthly fall in the broader measure of industrial output. But annual output growth of 1.8 percent was weaker than all forecasts.
Business surveys last week suggested official data for May could show an upturn.
Weak data in Britain were in parallel with disappointing figures from the euro zone after strong growth at the end of 2017.
""But there does seem to be something more insidious going on -- perhaps a lack of confidence across industry due to trade concerns,"" Shaw said.
U.S. President Donald Trump stunned allies on Sunday by backing out of a joint communique agreed by Group of Seven leaders in Canada that had mentioned the need for ""free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade"".
Britain's goods trade deficit rose unexpectedly to 14.0 billion pounds ($18.8 billion), the second widest on record, hit by falls in exports of aircraft, pharmaceuticals and machinery.
British trade minister Liam Fox said the figures looked better on an annual basis. 
""Far from the gloom some people report, today's trade figures show in the year to April 2018 the trade deficit narrowed by 6.7 billion pounds as overall exports rose by 7 percent,"" he said in a statement.
The figures also showed the construction sector failed to rebound. Output rose 0.5 percent month-on-month in April, undershooting all forecasts in the Reuters poll.
April capped the weakest three months for construction since mid-2012, and a fall in first-quarter construction orders outside the housing sector suggested little upturn soon.

""The construction industry dashboard is now a sea of warning lights,"" Blane Perrotton, managing director of property consultancy Naismiths said.

When measured on a year-over-year basis, industrial output was 3.8 percent higher.
Among the various components, manufacturing fell 2.3 percent from March, and construction dropped 0.6 percent. But utilities rose 4.9 percent and mining jumped 1.4 percent. 
Compared to the same month last year, construction climbed 3.8 percent and utilities rose 2.8 percent, while mining fell 6.2 percent. 
Mexico's industrial output is tightly linked to the U.S. economy, which receives about 80 percent of its exports, primarily factory-made goods like televisions and cars.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders in April jumped the most since the start of 2016, reversing the prior month's decline and raising some hopes for durable growth in capital expenditure seen as crucial for a recovery in the economy after a contraction in the first quarter.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital expenditure in the coming six to nine months, rose 10.1 percent and handily beat a 2.8 percent gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. They fell 3.9 percent in March.
The data issued by the Cabinet Office on Monday came as a less-than-expected increase in factory output and an unexpected declines in household spending in April added to concerns about the fragility of the economy after it contracted in the first quarter.
The specter of global trade war as U.S. President Donald Trump's pursues an ""America First"" policy has clouded the outlook for export-reliant Japan. Weakness in consumer spending is also weighing on the world's third largest economy.
Policymakers are counting on capital expenditure to drive a virtuous growth cycle of higher wages boosting consumer spending, corporate profits and inflation.
With inflation struggling to accelerate toward its 2 percent price target, the Bank of Japan is widely expected to stand pat at its policy setting meeting this week.
Economists expect capital expenditure to remain in a gradual uptrend backed by investment in robotics and labor-saving technologies to cope with a labor shortage as well as the need to upgrade aging plants and equipment.
The Cabinet Office said machinery orders are picking up, a slight upgrade from its previous assessment that they were showing signs of pick-up.
The value of core orders stood at 943.1 billion yen ($8.62 billion), the biggest since June 2008, the data showed.
By sector, orders from manufacturers jumped 22.7 percent in April, after a 17.5 percent decline in March, while service-sector orders increased 0.4 percent in April, up for a fourth straight month.
External demand for machinery, which is not counted as core orders, rose 10.0 percent in April, up for the first time in three months.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, grew 9.6 percent in April, versus a 3.9 percent increase expected.
The economy shrank at an annualized rate of 0.6 percent in January-March, with weaker private consumption offseting gains in capital expenditure.

Annual consumer inflation held steady in May from the previous month, as food prices remained largely stable, official data also showed on Saturday. 
The producer price index (PPI) rose 4.1 percent in May from a year earlier, bolstered by a recent jump in commodity prices and up from a lower base last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). That compared with an acceleration to 3.4 percent in April. 
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.4 percent in May, compared with a 0.2 percent decline in April. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May producer inflation would pick up to 3.9 percent, and predicted that producer inflation will accelerate again in June as global crude oil prices continue to rise. 
Raw material prices jumped 7.4 percent in May from a year earlier due to healthy demand from the steel sector and an easing of winter pollution curbs. That compared with a 5.7 percent increase in April. 
The higher factory-gate inflation helped to ease concerns of slowing momentum in the economy as the authorities implement tougher pollution controls on ""smokestack"" industries and cash-strapped regional governments cut back on big investment projects, curbing demand for building materials. 
The rise could also provide a lift to earnings. Chinese industrial firms' profits rose at their fastest pace in six months in April, with earnings for iron and steel processing firms jumping 260 percent.
CONSUMER INFLATION STEADY
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier, in line with expectations and unchanged from April's gain of 1.8 percent. 
    On a month-on-month basis, the CPI declined 0.2 percent.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.9 percent in May, down from 2.0 percent in April. 
    The food price index rose 0.1 percent from a year earlier, after rising 0.7 percent in April. Non-food prices rose 2.2 percent, compared with 2.1 percent growth a month ago. 
With China's inflation now hovering at a stable level, tense trade conflict between the world's two economic heavyweights is fuelling worries over upward pressure on the country's consumer price index. 
Agriculture products in particular could jump if Beijing followed through with its threat to impose tariffs on imports from the United States. That would lead to further upward pressure on pork prices, which have a large weighting in the consumer inflation basket. 
But analysts believe inflation is already past its peak as higher borrowing costs and a cooling property market dampen underlying price pressures. April economic data had shown signs of slowing momentum as investment growth touched a near 20-year low and retail sales growth weakened. 
""The momentum of overall inflationary (pressure) has been fading year-to-date, indicating the effect of faster-than-expected fiscal and monetary tightening and suggesting some room for policy 'fine-tuning',"" wrote macro analysts at CICC research in a note after the data release.
There have also been signs that policymakers have moved to a slightly looser stance as they look to ensure growth doesn't slow too much, while also keeping financial risks under control.
China's central bank injected hefty funds via one of its liquidity operations this week as more Chinese companies are concerned about tightening credit conditions. Analysts believe the move may possibly push back the timing of another expected cut in banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR). 
An official think tank last month forecast consumer inflation of around 2 percent and expected producer price inflation would pick-up to about 3.8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. April wholesale inventories revised up slightly,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories were a bit higher than initially estimated in April amid increases in the stocks of motor vehicles and a range of other goods.
The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories edged up 0.1 percent instead of being unchanged as it reported last month. Stocks at wholesalers rose 0.2 percent in March. They increased 5.8 percent year-on-year in April.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - nudged up 0.1 percent in April.
Inventory investment added just over one-tenth of a percentage point to the economy's 2.2 percent annualized growth pace during the January-March period. Economists expect the pace of inventory accumulation to remain moderate in the second quarter.
A report on Monday showed inventories at manufacturers rose 0.3 percent in April after gaining 0.2 percent in March.
Wholesale auto inventories increased 0.4 percent in April after ticking up 0.1 percent in March. There were also increases in inventories of professional and computer equipment as well as metals and hardware. Wholesale petroleum stocks surged 3.1 percent in April after increasing 1.2 percent in March.
Sales at wholesalers jumped 0.8 percent in April after rising 0.4 percent in March. Sales of motor vehicles fell 0.7 percent in April after sliding 1.2 percent in the prior month.
At April's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.28 months to clear shelves, down from 1.29 months in March.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output and exports fell in April, data showed on Friday, adding to signs that Europe's largest economy started the second quarter on a weak footing.
Data from the Economy Ministry showed output fell by 1.0 percent, well below a Reuters forecast for a rise of 0.3 percent. Separate data from the Federal Statistics Office showed exports fell by 0.3 percent in April while imports rose 2.2 percent.
On Thursday, data showed industrial orders fell unexpectedly by 2.5 percent.
""The German economy will only make timid headway in the second quarter,"" VP Bank chief economist Thomas Gitzel wrote in a note to clients. ""Weak industrial orders, weak exports and disappointing industrial production are a bitter setback.""
Industrial output, orders and exports have fallen in three of the first four months of the year. This weakness has so far been mainly linked to long public holidays, cold weather and flu epidemics.
DEEPER CONCERNS?
But economists are starting to consider more deep-seated factors.
Sophia Krietenbrink, an analyst with the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce said concerns about protectionist trade policies were creating uncertainty for German companies.
""It seems as if supply-side constraints are increasingly hampering Germany’s growth prospects,"" added Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba in a note to clients.
""Both equipment and labor are currently at their highest levels ever and are limiting factors to production. Against this background, more investment seems to be the best and easiest way forward.""

Friday's data also showed the trade surplus shrank to 19.4 billion euros in April from a downwardly revised reading of 21.6 billion euros in March. Analysts had expected a surplus of 21.0 billion euros.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 01:55AM ET</span>","China's export growth steady in May, import growth faster but not from U.S.","By Lusha Zhang and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China maintained solid export growth of 12.6 percent in May, slightly slower than in April, but still providing good news for Beijing's policymakers as they deal with tough trade negotiations with Washington. 
Imports also rose more than anticipated in May and at the fastest pace since January, with the data coming at a time when China has pledged to its trade partners - including the United States - that steps would be taken to increase imports.
China, the world's largest exporter, has so far escaped any major blow to its foreign trade sector despite rising trade tensions with the United States, which last week warned it would continue to pursue tariffs on Chinese imports.
That bodes well for the world's second-largest economy, as policymakers tighten access to credit domestically to prevent asset bubbles and limit heavy industry in many regions as part of a big effort to clean up severe air, water and soil pollution. 
""Trade performance in Q2 so far has been better than expected and may offer some upside to Q2 GDP growth,"" Betty Wang, senior China Economist at ANZ, wrote in a note. 
But trade tensions with the U.S. remain a risk. 
A third round of talks between the two economic heavyweights concluded in Beijing last weekend with few signs of progress, as China issued a counter-warning that any trade and business deals reached with Washington would be void if the United States implemented tariffs.
The median forecast from a Reuters survey of 32 analysts had pointed to 10 percent export growth in May, but the actual outturn showed little loss of momentum, coming in just a shade below the 12.7 percent growth posted in April. 
Irrespective of chances of a trade war, analysts warn that China's export growth is likely to stall.
""Even if a trade war is avoided, Chinese trade growth is still likely to edge down over the coming year as the global economy loses momentum and headwinds to domestic demand from slower credit growth intensify,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the data. 
Imports grew 26 percent in May, the General Administration of Customs said, beating analysts' forecast of 18.7 percent growth, and compared with a 21.5 percent rebound in April. 
Strong growth in imports were driven by purchases of computer chips as well as commodities including agricultural crude oil, copper ore and concentrate and natural gas. 
China is reported to be importing record volumes of U.S. oil and is likely to buy more U.S. soy after Beijing signaled to state-run refiners and grains purchasers they should buy more to help ease trade tensions.
Among major trading partners, China's imports from Australia saw biggest turnaround in growth in May, rising 22.4 percent year-on-year after falling 3.1 percent in April. Imports from South Korea rose 31.8 percent in May.
China's imports and exports both showed stronger growth over the first five months of the year than they did during the same period a year ago, customs data shows. 
China' trade surplus narrowed to $24.92 billion in May from $28.38 billion in April, and came in well below analysts forecasts for a $31.9 billion surplus.
Still a widening in China's surplus with the United States is likely to further irritate Washington.
TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. WIDENS
China's exports to the United States rose 11.6 percent in May from a year earlier, compared with a 9.7 percent rise in April. Its imports from the United States rose 11.4 percent in May, far slower than the 20.3 percent growth shown in April.
That widened China's surplus with the United States to $24.58 billion in May from $22.15 billion in April, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data released on Friday.
For January-May, the surplus stood at $104.85 billion, compared with about $92.9 billion in the same period last year.
China and the United States had appeared to have been on the verge of a truce over trade until the White House warned in late May that it would pursue tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, as well as impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States and tighter export controls. A final list of Chinese imports subject to 25 percent tariffs will be announced on June 15, with more detailed investment restrictions to be unveiled by the end of the month. China agreed to import more energy and agricultural commodities to narrow the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China following intensive talks in Washington last month. Beijing also said it would cut tariffs on nearly 1,500 consumer products as it looks to boost imports as part of efforts to open up the economy. But analysts say it would be a tall order for China to cut its trade surplus by $200 billion a year as the White House is demanding. To do so, it would have to buy the equivalent of more than 600 Boeing (N:BA) airliners annually.
So far, China's customs hasn't released final April commodities trade statistics which had been due on May 23, and some traders have speculated that Beijing may want to conceal statistics that could somehow undermine its negotiating stance.

Yuan-denominated imports rose 15.6 percent last month, up from 11.6 percent growth in April, resulting in a trade surplus of 156.51 billion yuan.
China's trade performance has had a strong start this year, supported by sustained demand at home and abroad.
But the export outlook is being clouded by a heated trade dispute with the United States, which could disrupt its shipments and supply chains, while a cooling property market may curb China's demand for imported raw materials such as iron ore.

The result for gross domestic product missed forecasts.
Key Takeaways
Japan’s economy is forecast to have resumed growing in the second quarter, but consumer spending remains a drag. The downward revision to first-quarter private consumption was the result of an upward revision to the figures for the previous quarter, economy minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Friday. Yet weaker-than-expected household spending in April suggests the economy will continue to rely primarily on external demand, at a time when escalating trade battles pose risks for exports.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Spending pinch, royal wedding give UK shops worst May in 12 years: BDO","LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers suffered their worst May in 12 years, a survey showed, hit by the distraction of a royal wedding for many shoppers but also underlining the changes in spending patterns that have contributed to a spate of store closures this year.
Turnover among retailers dropped 2.2 percent year-on-year in May after a 3.8 percent annual drop in April, according to accountancy BDO's monthly High Street Sales Tracker published on Friday.
Shops were ""deserted"" for their usually busy Saturday trading on May 19 as Britons opted to stay in to watch the marriage of Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle, BDO said.
While its report differed with a British Retail Consortium survey this week which showed sales values rose strongly in May, it chimed with other signs that Britain's retailers are struggling.
On Thursday, House of Fraser said it needed to close 31 stores to survive, in a plan likely to result in as many as 6,000 job losses.
Retailers are shutting shops in the face of competition from online retailers such as Amazon (O:AMZN), a squeeze on consumer budgets and a change in Britons' spending habits away from fashion and towards holidays and entertainment.
Wage growth has started to outstrip inflation again, easing some of the pinch for households who have been hit by rising prices for much of the period since the June 2016 Brexit vote.
Still, BDO said this had little effect so far.
""The rise in wages and lower inflation has only had a notional impact on the consumer purse. It has been insufficient to ignite much-needed spending on the high street,"" Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said.

The world's fifth-largest economy looks likely to grow by 1.4 percent in 2018, according to the CBI, weaker than projected growth in the euro zone of 2.2 percent and in the United States of 2.8 percent.
Britain went from being the fastest-growing economy in the Group of Seven to its slowest last year as the value of the pound fell after the Brexit vote in 2016 and companies turned cautious about investment.
The CBI argued before the Brexit referendum that staying in the EU would be best for Britain's economy 
The CBI's forecast for Britain's growth rate this year represented a slight reduction from its previous forecast of 1.5 percent, reflecting the economy's weak start to the year during unusually cold weather, the group said. 
Growth looks set to slow to 1.3 percent in 2019, when it will again lag behind the euro zone and the United States, the CBI said. 
With less than a year to go before Britain is due to leave the EU, the CBI described the risks to the economy as ""skewed to the downside"", especially if talks between London and Brussels on their new post-Brexit relationship turn sour.
Uncertainty over Brexit continued to weigh on corporate investment, but the CBI said a growing number of its members planned to spend more on automation, robotics and training to circumvent skill shortages.
The CBI's chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, said such technologies were becoming much more affordable so a lot of businesses were starting to adopt them.

""But at the same time there's a huge amount of uncertainty in a lot of sectors about what our future relationship with the European Union will be,"" she said. ""That means it's just harder to make those very long-term, capital intensive decisions. Businesses are still holding back.""

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 01:04PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims drop as labor market picks up steam,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a further tightening in labor market conditions.
The robust labor market and firming inflation have cemented expectations the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark U.S. interest rates next week. Many economists believe the U.S. central bank will hike rates two more times after its June 12-13 policy meeting to prevent the economy from overheating. 
The Fed lifted borrowing costs in March and forecast at least two more rate increases for this year.
""The labor market is heating up and that means inflation pressures are building, so the Federal Reserve better get ready for it,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief U.S. economist at MUFG in New York. ""Rates are going up at next week's meeting and more are on the way.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended June 2, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 225,000 in the latest week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,750 to 225,500 last week. 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose marginally and stocks on Wall Street were mixed. 
The labor market is considered to be close to or at full employment. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 223,000 jobs in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent.
The jobless rate, which has declined by three-tenths of a percentage point this year, is now at a level where the Fed projected it would be by the end of this year. 
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 21,000 to 1.74 million in the week ended May 26. The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims dropped 13,250 to 1.73 million, the lowest since December 1973.
WORKER SHORTAGE
Layoffs have remained very low amid signs of growing worker shortages across all sectors of the economy. Data on Tuesday showed there were a record 6.7 million job openings in April. The number of unemployed people per vacancy slipped to 0.9 from 1.0 in March.
Economists expect the shrinking pool of unemployed workers will result in an acceleration in wage growth as companies are forced to raise compensation to attract and retain labor. Annual wage growth has remained below 3.0 percent.
""As the unemployment rate inches lower, businesses will find it increasingly difficult to fill open positions,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The strong job market conditions were also underscored by the publication on Thursday of the Labor Department's Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangements survey, which showed 1.3 percent of U.S. workers in May 2017 held jobs they considered temporary or did not expect to last beyond a year.
That is a decline from 1.8 percent in February 2005 when the government last conducted a similar survey.
When self-employed individuals and independent contractors were included, the share of workers was 1.6 percent in May 2017, down from 2.3 percent in February 2005. Most contingent workers were under the age of 25.
""This should throw some cold water on those hyping the explosion of freelancing and the rapidly changing nature of work,"" said Lawrence Mishel, a fellow at Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
But others said the survey's findings contradicted independent research and faulted the government's methodology, which used the same measurements as 13 years ago to gather data. The last time that the government conducted the survey was before the invention of smartphones.
""This data is saying that the percentage of workers in contingent or alternative work arrangements has either stayed the same or declined since the advent of smartphones,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""The labor market has changed a great deal, not only over the last 13 years, but over the last generation.""

The Labor Department will publish its Contingent Worker Supplement report in September. It is expected to shed light on the so-called gig economy.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) expects that first-quarter gross domestic product could be pared to a 2.0 percent annualized rate when the government publishes its third growth estimate later this month.
The Commerce Department reported last month that the economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the January-March period. 
""We think that consumption related to nonprofit hospitals will be the main culprit behind our expected downward revision,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. 
""The latest GDP report showed that nominal gross output of nonprofit hospitals increased (at a) 3.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter, but related data on revenue from the QSS point to a modest decline in consumption during the quarter.""

Nonprofit hospital spending accounts for nearly 4 percent of GDP. As result, growth in consumer spending could be revised lower. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, was reported to have expanded at a 1.0 percent rate the first quarter, the slowest in almost five years.

1653,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Turkey Central Bank Is Latest to Surprise With Rate Increase,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey joined a string of emerging-market central banks whose interest-rate decisions have surprised investors, tightening policy on Thursday for the third time in less than two months. The lira surged and the nation’s bonds rallied.
The decision came three days after an inflation report showed consumer prices rose 12.15 percent in May from a year earlier, with the worst core reading on record and producer prices advancing more than 20 percent.
Investor expectations were building for another increase after central bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya and Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek met investors in London late last month to reassure them that policy makers were willing to act if necessary. But no one in a Bloomberg survey expected an increase of the magnitude Turkey delivered, raising its one-week repo rate by 125 basis points to 17.75 percent and signalling that it’s willing to stand up against political pressure and fight double-digit inflation
“Is this the start of a new era of Turkish central bank policy -- actually moving ahead of the market? Let’s hope so,” said Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst for EMEA at Medley Global Advisors. “Positive impact on the lira is seen as the repo rate rises. How things develop on both the policy front and for the lira longer-term will depend on events after the June 24 elections and whether Erdogan gives the CBRT latitude to act independently.”
A combination of a rising dollar, spiraling inflation, widening budget and current account deficits, and political pressure for lower rates spurred a flight from lira assets in May. The central bank responded to the rout by first raising its late-liquidity window by 300 basis points at an unscheduled meeting, and then announcing a decision to to simplify its interest-rate regime, setting the one-week repurchase rate as its main funding tool.
The bank didn’t publish any information on its other rates on Thursday, a move that seemed to be in line with its earlier announcement that it was simplifying policy.
While Turkey has domestic challenges to contend with, other key emerging markets have also been hiking interest rates faster than investors anticipated in part because of a need to protect their economies against a rising dollar and outflows of capital as the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy. India’s central bank this week raised its benchmark for the first time since 2014, joining peers in Indonesia, Mexico and Argentina. Brazil is also coming under pressure from investors.
The lira rallied 1.9 percent to 4.4701 per dollar as of 3:00 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield on 10-year bonds reversed an earlier climb to slide 31 basis points to 14.9 percent after touching a record-high 15.41 percent on Wednesday. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index rose 1.6 percent, with banking shares jumping as much as 3.4 percent.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",German industrial orders plunge due to fears of trade war,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders plunged due to weak demand from domestic and euro zone clients in April, posting their fourth straight drop on the month, as growing uncertainty about a global trade war led companies to scale back investment plans.
The weaker-than-expected data, published by the Federal Statistics Office on Thursday, suggested that the upswing in Europe's largest economy could further lose momentum after its quarterly growth rate halved at the beginning of the year.
Contracts for goods 'Made in Germany' fell by 2.5 percent on the month in April after a downwardly revised drop of 1.1 percent the previous month, the data showed.
The reading significantly undershot a Reuters poll of analysts, who had predicted a 0.8 percent rise. It was the first time since the financial crisis in 2008 that German industrial orders have fallen for four months in a row.
VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel pointed to rising uncertainty sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in March to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
""This has probably unsettled companies in the euro zone and with it slowed demand for capital goods,"" Gitzel added.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier warned against the growing tide of protectionism, saying that tariffs and trade barriers helped nobody. But he remained bullish on the prospects for Europe's powerhosue.
""There is no rule that says this upswing has to be over soon,"" he told a conference in Berlin on Thursday. If the current boom continues into next year, it will be Germany's longest upturn in more than half a century.
Investors fear the U.S. could impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on the same ""national security"" grounds used to impose the steel and aluminum duties - a move that would particularly hit Germany's important automobile industry.
A sector breakdown of the industrial orders data showed demand for capital and consumer goods fell the most in April, driven by especially weak orders from other euro zone countries.
Overall, orders from domestic clients were down 4.8 percent while foreign demand edged down 0.8 percent, the data showed. 
LOSS OF MOMENTUM
DIHK economist Sophia Krietenbrink said the unexpected drop in orders could signal a loss of economic momentum despite the fact that order backlogs were still high.
""Trade conflicts, in particular, are causing considerable uncertainty from outside,"" she said.
The release followed a string of strong economic data that included retail sales posting a bigger-than-expected jump in April, unemployment reaching a record low in May and business morale steadying despite the threat of a global trade war.
Germany's VDMA industry association said on Wednesday that engineering orders had jumped 12 percent in April compared to a year before, with surging domestic demand offsetting a drop in contracts from euro zone partners.
The German economy grew 0.3 percent on the quarter in the first three months of the year after 0.6 percent at the end of 2017. So far, economists had predicted up to 0.5 percent growth in the second quarter.
But Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Ralph Solveen said the weak orders data now pointed to the Germany economy growing only at a moderate pace also in the April-June period.

For 2018 as a whole, the government forecasts 2.3 percent growth.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone began the year with slower economic growth as fears of a trade war with the United States appeared to take their toll, official data showed on Thursday. 
The economic slowdown in the 19-country bloc in the first quarter of the year was caused by lower trade and coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump's threats in March of high duties on steel and aluminum imports from global partners, including the EU - threats turned into actual tariffs last week.
The euro zone's output expanded by 0.4 percent on the quarter in the first three months of the year, a marked deceleration from 0.7 percent growth in the previous quarter, data released by EU statistics office Eurostat showed, confirming earlier estimates.
On the year, growth slowed to 2.5 percent from 2.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Germany, the bloc's largest economy and main exporter, saw its output expansion halved to 0.3 percent on the quarter in the January-March period.
Reduced trade contributed to the slower pace of the expansion, which was propped up by increased consumption and investments. 
Euro zone exports fell by 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter and imports dropped by 0.1 percent, in a sign of slower global trade.
In the previous quarter, euro zone exports grew 2.2 percent and imports rose by 1.5 percent.
The drop in exports contributed to a loss of 0.2 percentage points to the euro zone output, data show.
The trade losses were offset by growing consumer spending and an increase in investments.
Household consumption rose by 0.5 percent in the currency bloc, from 0.2 percent in the previous quarter, in a sign that the bloc's economy could be relying more on domestic spending. 
""However, this is less encouraging than it first seems,"" Capital Economics, a research firm, said in a note, adding the rise of consumer spending was likely mostly due to higher consumption of heating and fuel in colder-than-usual winter months, rather than being a structural shift in consumers' habits.
Gross fixed capital formation, a measure for investments, also grew by 0.5 percent in the first quarter, but much less than in the previous quarter when it rose by 1.3 percent.

The United States also grew less, slowing to 0.5 percent in the first quarter from 0.7 percent.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose a quarterly 0.3 percent in the first quarter, data showed last week, slowing from 0.4 percent in the last three months of 2017. The annual growth rate of 1.4 percent was the slowest since the first quarter of 2017.
Retail sales in April fell for the fourth time in five months and posted their steepest annual drop for more than five years, data showed earlier on Thursday.
Italy forecast in April that GDP would increase 1.5 percent in 2018. That would be in line with last year's rate which was the strongest since 2010, but would leave Italy in its customary position among the euro zone's most sluggish economies.

Wednesday's report from the Commerce Department was the latest sign of robust economic growth in the second quarter. 
But a protectionist trade policy being pursued by President Donald Trump, which has seen the United States slapping tariffs on imports from a host of countries including China, Mexico and Canada, as well as those in the European Union, poses a threat to the otherwise rosy economic outlook.
""One is hard-pressed as to not concur that the U.S. economy not only remains on solid footing, but is likely to show an accelerated pace of growth in the second quarter,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Still, ""trade tensions remain a threat to the outlook and clearly have the potential to derail economic growth,"" he said.
The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 2.1 percent to $46.2 billion, the smallest since September. Data for March was revised to show the trade deficit falling to $47.2 billion, instead of the previously reported $49.0 billion. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit unchanged at $49 billion in April. When adjusted for inflation, the trade gap narrowed to $77.5 billion from $78.2 billion in March. The so-called real trade deficit is below its $82.5 billion average in the first quarter.
If the trend in the real trade deficit is maintained, trade could contribute to gross domestic product in the second quarter after having a neutral impact in the January-March period.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies while stocks on Wall Street rose.
Trump in March announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect domestic industries from what he says is unfair competition from foreign producers. Last week he extended the duties to steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. 
Mexico has retaliated with measures targeting a wide range of U.S. farm and industrial products. Canada has said it would slap tariffs on imports from the United States, including whiskey, orange juice, steel, aluminum and other products.
Exports to Mexico, Canada and the European Union have recorded double-digit growth so far this year.
RISKY TRADE STRATEGY
""We fail to understand the strategy of risking a trade war with Europe, Canada, and Mexico particularly at a time when the U.S. appears to be expanding strongly in these markets,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
A trade war is also brewing with China. Washington and Beijing have threatened tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth up to $150 billion each. Trump claims the United States is being taken advantage of by its trading partners, but economists warn that tariffs will undercut the economy, raising prices and destroying jobs for Americans.
Economists say tariffs will do little to shrink the trade deficit, partly because of the dollar's status as the global reserve currency and the low U.S. saving rate, including a fiscal deficit that has been blown up by a $1.5 trillion tax cut package.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China increased 8.1 percent to $28.0 billion in April. The United States had a $0.8 billion goods trade deficit with Canada and a $5.7 billion shortfall with Mexico.
Exports of goods and services rose 0.3 percent to a record $211.2 billion in April. It was the third monthly increase in exports. They were in April supported by a $1.3 billion increase in deliveries of industrial supplies and materials such as fuel oil and petroleum products. 
Exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest on record in April. Soybean exports increased $0.3 billion and corn shipments also rose by a similar amount. But exports of commercial aircraft tumbled $2.8 billion.
Imports of goods and services slipped 0.2 percent to $257.4 billion in April. Imports of consumer goods dropped $2.8 billion, weighed by a $2.2 billion decline in imports of cellphones and other household goods. 
Motor vehicle imports fell $1.0 billion. Economists said the drop in imports was likely temporary given strong domestic demand. Crude oil imports rose $1.0 billion in April, with prices averaging $54.50 per barrel. 

""American consumers' love affair with exotic foreign goods remains ongoing,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Many U.S. companies are also hooked on foreign goods to help make their own finished products as well.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian exports rose to a record high in April as firms shrugged off uncertainty caused by U.S. protectionist policies, helping to cut the trade deficit to a six-month low, Statistics Canada data indicated on Wednesday.
The deficit shrank to C$1.90 billion ($1.47 billion), down from C$3.93 billion in March. The shortfall - less than the C$3.40 billion deficit forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll - was the smallest since a C$1.49 billion gap recorded in October 2017.
""It's really positive as we head into the second quarter. There is continued strength in the export side,"" said Ross Prusakowski, a senior economist at Export Development Canada.
The data were released as policymakers fret over the impact of new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and slow-moving talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Bank of Canada repeatedly cites the uncertainty over NAFTA's future as a risk factor for the economy. That means the central bank will be data-dependent as it sets monetary policy, Governor Stephen Poloz said on Saturday.
Canada's exports increased 1.6 percent - the sixth gain in seven months - to a new high of C$48.56 billion, on higher shipments of metal and non-metallic mineral products, consumer goods and energy products.
""It is nice in the short term, but there are a lot of issues ahead of us for Canadian exporters to deal with,"" said Michael Dolega, a senior economist at TD Bank.
Imports, which hit a new high in March, dipped 2.5 percent to C$50.47 billion in April. Imports of motor vehicles and parts fell 5.8 percent after two months of strong increases.
The Canadian dollar  strengthened, rising to C$1.2878 to the U.S. dollar, or 77.65 U.S. cents, from C$1.2909, or 77.47 U.S. cents, before the data were released.
Separately, data released in Washington showed the U.S. trade deficit in April fell to a seven-month low.
The data underscored the continued importance of the giant U.S. market, which took 74.3 percent of all Canadian goods exports in April. 
Exports to the United States rose 3.2 percent while imports dropped 1.4 percent. As a result, the trade surplus with the United States grew to C$3.63 billion in April from C$2.03 billion in March.

Separately, Statscan said the value of Canadian building permits fell 4.6 percent in April from March, the biggest decline in five months, on weakness in both the residential and non-residential sectors.

The Labor Department said on Wednesday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 0.4 percent annualized rate in the January-March quarter, instead of the 0.7 percent pace it reported last month.
Fourth-quarter productivity rose at an unrevised 0.3 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected that first-quarter productivity would be revised down to a 0.6 percent growth rate. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2017, productivity increased at an unrevised rate of 1.3 percent. 
Hourly compensation accelerated at a 3.3 percent rate in the January-March quarter, rather than the 3.4 percent pace reported last month. Compensation rose at 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter. It increased at a 2.6 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2017.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a 2.9 percent pace in the first three months of the year, rather than the 2.7 percent rate reported in May.

Labor costs rose at a rate of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter. They were up at a 1.3 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2017.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Growing inflation concerns prompted India's central bank to raise its policy rate for the first time in over four years on Wednesday, but it surprised some economists by keeping its stance ""neutral"" instead of changing to ""tighten"".
The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) lifted the repo rate  by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent - the first rate change since a 25 basis point cut in August 2017.
The committee ""felt that there was enough uncertainty for us to keep to the neutral stance and yet respond to the risks to (the) inflation target that have emerged in recent months,"" RBI Governor Urjit Patel told reporters. 
Inflation worries have risen due to a steep spike in global oil prices and a weakening rupee , plus a potential rise in consumer spending as India's economy expanded at a robust 7.7 percent annual pace in the January-March quarter.
""With growth strengthening and core inflation picking up, we think today's hike marks the start of a modest tightening cycle,"" said Shilan Shah, the senior India economist at Capital Economics. 
Following the rate decision, India's 10-year benchmark bond yields  rose to 7.93 percent - the highest levels since May 17 - from 7.83 percent before the policy statement. The rupee rose to 66.95 to the dollar from 67.05 prior to the announcement.
India's main stock market index (NSEI) added to its gains on Wednesday, as shares of state-run lenders rose after the RBI extended a move to let them spread their bond trading losses, which should ease pressure on those laden with bad debt.
The index, up 0.6 percent before the RBI statement, ended 0.9 percent ahead.
HIGHER INFLATION SEEN
The RBI on Wednesday raised its inflation projection for the second-half of fiscal 2018-19, which ends in March 2019, to 4.7 percent from the 4.4 percent seen earlier.
""If the current trend of increasing inflation and oil prices continues, we expect another 25 bps hike somewhere during this fiscal year,"" said Sudhakar Pattabiraman, head of research operations at research firm William O'Neil. 
Wednesday's rate increase, the first since January 2014, was predicted by 46 percent of respondents in a Reuters poll this week.
All six members on the policy panel voted for a rate hike.
The reverse repo rate  was increased by 25 basis points to 6.00 percent.
India's annual consumer inflation  was 4.58 percent in April, the sixth straight month it topped the RBI's medium-term 4 percent target. 
The Indian central bank becomes the latest in Asia to increase rates recently, to battle inflationary pressures or support the domestic currency. 
In May, the Philippines and Indonesia lifted their benchmark rates for the first time since 2014. In March, China raised a key short-term rate following a Federal Reserve's rate hike.

India's rate increase comes one week before a Fed policy meeting that's widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Japan's first quarter GDP likely shrank less than initial reading on capex gain: Reuters poll,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely shrank less than initially estimated in the first quarter, reinforcing views that it will quickly regain traction in coming months, a Reuters poll found on Wednesday.
Weighed by weak domestic demand and a slowdown in exports, the world's third-largest economy probably shrank an annualised 0.4 percent in the first quarter, less than a preliminary reading of a 0.6 percent contraction, the poll of 16 economists showed.
On a quarterly basis, growth was expected to dip 0.1 percent, marginally less than a 0.2 percent fall indicated in preliminary data. Revised figures will be released on Friday.
Expectations of a milder contraction were driven by a less pessimistic view of company spending.
Capital expenditure was seen rising 0.2 percent for the quarter, up from a 0.1 percent decline in the preliminary data.
""The expected upgrade in capital spending likely helped the GDP to revised up,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""But there is no change that the economy came to a temporary standstill at the beginning of this year after having grown solidly.""
Many economists project the economy will rebound in April-June and return to a moderate growth trend, but weak data on Tuesday raised the possibility of a recession.
Household spending unexpectedly fall in April and services sector activity slowed in May. Also industrial production grew less than expected in April.
""We expect the economy will grow in the second quarter but the latest data suggest we need give heed to a possibility of a slower pace of recovery than previously expected,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The Cabinet Office will issue revised GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on Friday June 8 Japan time (2350 GMT on June 7).
The first-quarter contraction ended Japan's longest period of economic expansion since its 1980s bubble economy.

1664,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",Australia's Economy Accelerates Faster Than Expected on Exports,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy expanded faster than forecast in the first quarter as exports rebounded, underscoring the central bank’s expectation of stronger growth this year.
Gross domestic product advanced 1 percent from the prior quarter, with overseas shipments accounting for half the expansion, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney Wednesday. Economists had forecast a 0.9 percent gain. The economy expanded at an annual pace of 3.1 percent, also beating estimates for a 2.8 percent increase.
Australia’s economy enjoyed a tailwind from revived exports following disruptions late last year; it’s set for a further boost from liquefied natural gas shipments as large projects in the northwest come online. The central bank is acting as an anchor, keeping the benchmark interest rate at a record-low 1.5 percent and with no immediate prospect of a tightening; however, the reliance on overseas sales for growth was noted by economists.
“We doubt that the strength of net exports will be sustained as there was an element of catch-up,” said Paul Dales, chief economist for Australia at Capital Economics Ltd. “We fear that still subdued real income growth and the weakening housing market will mean a lot of the softness in consumption lingers.”
The Australian dollar rose to 76.54 U.S. cents at 1:03 p.m. in Sydney from 76.34 cents before the release.
Reflecting weak wages growth, the household savings ratio fell to 2.1 percent in the first quarter, the lowest level since the final three months of 2007, from a downwardly revised 2.3 percent as consumers drew on funds to maintain spending. Household spending grew by just 0.3 percent, adding 0.2 percentage point to GDP growth.
Government spending advanced 1.6 percent as authorities in the eastern states embark on major infrastructure projects to cope with expanding populations in their major cities.
“Recent data on the Australian economy have been consistent with the bank’s central forecast for GDP growth to pick up, to average a bit above 3 percent in 2018 and 2019,” Governor Philip Lowe said Tuesday after standing pat for a 22nd month. “Business conditions are positive and non-mining business investment is increasing. Higher levels of public infrastructure investment are also supporting the economy.”
Yet the Reserve Bank of Australia chief’s optimism came with his repeated warning that a “continuing source of uncertainty is the outlook for household consumption” amid sluggish wages growth and high debt.
Waiting Game
Traders are pricing in little chance of a rate hike before mid-2019 as the jobless rate remains well shy of the central bank’s estimated full employment rate at 5 percent. Only at that level or lower is the economy expected to generate sufficient wage growth to drive inflation back up to the midpoint of the 2-3 percent target range.
Wednesday’s report showed private investment in machinery and equipment continued to grow strongly, particularly in industries outside the resource sector. Production of coal, iron ore and liquefied natural gas recorded strong increases.
Australia is the developed world’s most China-dependent economy, shipping vast quantitues of iron ore to the mainland for steel production. At the same time, China’s burgeoning middle class is boosting demand for Australian education for their children and tourism as their economy -- like Australia’s -- transitions toward services.
“The better-than-expected data means we now see the economy expanding by close to 3 percent this year,” said Sarah Hunter, head of macroeconomics at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney. “But with headwinds still coming from consumer spending and a downturn in residential construction activity set to materialize in the second half of the year,” growth is likely to slow in 2019.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy grew at the fastest annual pace in almost two years as it entered its 27th year of growth without a recession, but uncertainty over household consumption and global trade dimmed the outlook for future growth. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 1 percent in the first quarter, from an upwardly revised 0.5 percent in the December quarter, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday.
Annual growth jumped to 3.1 percent from the December quarter's 2.4 percent.
The result just beat market forecasts of growth of 0.9 percent for the quarter and 2.8 percent on-year, pushing the local dollar up a quarter of a cent to $0.7665 . 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had sounded upbeat about future economic growth after its policy meeting on Tuesday but kept interest rates steady at 1.5 percent in anticipation of a gradual revival in inflation.
Investors suspect interest rates will stay on hold for a long time to come: Interbank futures <0#YIB:> are not fully priced for a hike until September 2019.
A bumper run in exports was the main driver of the first-quarter acceleration, accounting for half the growth in GDP, while government spending and non-mining investment also helped. 
Household consumption - which accounts for around 57 percent of GDP - contributed 0.2 percentage point to growth in the quarter.
However, there was caution around reading too much into the quarterly numbers.
""While recent data does point to an acceleration in March-quarter GDP growth, there have been numerous growth spikes in Australia to around 1 percent, quarter-on-quarter, in recent years only to be followed by a cooling again,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP.
""Uncertainty remains around the outlook for consumer spending: Household debt is high, banks are tightening lending standards, wage growth and inflation remain low and will pick up only gradually, and house prices are falling,"" Oliver added.
Household spending on insurance, transport, health care and utilities grew the most while spending on alcoholic drinks, cigarettes and eating out dropped, the data showed.
Some of that spending had to be funded by reduced saving, with the savings ratio falling to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Japan April real wages unchanged in blow to consumer spending,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese workers' inflation-adjusted real wages showed no growth in April from the same period a year earlier in a sign that consumer spending could lose momentum.
That follows a downwardly revised 0.7 percent annual increase in real wages in March, which suggests that the government's repeated efforts to encourage private-sector wage gains have fallen flat.
Growth in March was the first in four months, which had fueled optimism that a gradual rise in workers' salaries would stimulate consumer spending in Japan.
The data could be discouraging for the Bank of Japan as it struggles to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent price target.
The real wage data follows weak readings on household spending and industrial production, which have cast doubt on whether the economy can bounce back from a contraction in the first quarter.
Nominal cash earnings rose 0.8 percent year-on-year in April, slower than a downwardly revised 2.0 percent annual gain in March, data showed on Wednesday.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, grew 1.2 percent in the year to April, matching the annual increase in the previous month. 

Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, rose an annual 1.9 percent in April versus an upwardly revised 2.2 percent year-on-year increase in March.

That was the highest level since the government started tracking the series in December 2000. The number of hires rose to 5.6 million in April from 5.5 million in the prior month.

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 58.6 in May, from 56.8 the previous month.
Economists had forecast a reading of 57.9.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector, and a reading below 50 signals contraction.
The new orders sub-index ticked up to 60.5 from 60.0 in April. The employment sub-index rose to 54.1 last month from the prior months reading of 53.6. The prices sub-index climbed to 64.3 from April’s 61.8.

Research firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.0 in May from 52.8 in April, compared to forecasts for a reading of 52.9.
The latest reading was the highest since February and signalled a solid upturn in overall business activity across the service economy. Firms cited a catch-up from the snow-related disruption seen in the first quarter of 2018, alongside sustained growth of incoming new work.
But new business volumes continued to rise at a relatively subdued rate, with firms noting that Brexit-related uncertainty remained a key factor holding back decision making among clients. At the same time, tight labor market conditions placed upward pressure on staff wages and difficulties recruiting skilled staff. 
Employment in the sector increased at the second-slowest pace since March 2017, the report said.
“The improvement in service sector activity adds to evidence that the economy is on course to rebound in the second quarter but, like the earlier manufacturing and construction surveys, raises questions about the outlook”, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler Markit.
“So far, the three PMI surveys indicate that GDP looks set to rise by 0.3-0.4% in the second quarter.”
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector on Friday showed that activity picked up in May for the first time in six months, but the underlying trend remained weak, while another report on Monday showed that construction activity growth remained subdued last month.

(Reuters) - Euro zone business activity slowed again in May, a survey showed on Tuesday, and forward-looking indicators suggest a further loss of momentum in coming months.
The pace of growth has slowed from the turn of the year and - possibly of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank - inflation pressure also eased last month.
Still, inflation was 1.9 percent last month, official data showed on Thursday, pretty much bang on the ECB's target and giving the central bank room to move away from its ultra-easy monetary policy.
The ECB will finish its stimulus programme by the end of this year, according to a Reuters poll of economists last month. [ECILT/EU]
IHS Markit's Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall indicator of euro zone growth, fell to an 18-month low of 54.1 in May from April 's 55.1, still above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""With the economic indicators turning down at the same time as political uncertainty has spiked higher, the euro zone's outlook has darkened dramatically compared to the sunny forecast seen at the start of the year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
New order growth weakened, backlogs of work were amassed at a shallower rate and hiring slowed. This meant firms were at their least optimistic since late 2016, causing the future output index to sink to 63.7 from 65.7.
Williamson said the data pointed to a quarterly growth rate of 0.4 to 0.5 percent, weaker than the 0.6 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month.
""On the upside, companies reported business to have been disrupted by an unusually high number of holidays in May, especially in France and Germany, suggesting growth could rebound in June,"" Williamson said.
Earlier surveys showed growth in Germany, Europe's largest economy, slumped to a 20-month low in June while the expansion in French services also plummeted.
A survey covering the bloc's dominant service industry also declined. The services PMI fell to 53.8 from 54.7, its lowest since the start of 2017 [EUR/PMIM].
And indicating little chance of a bounceback this month, new business growth weakened. The sub-index declined to 53.5, a 17-month low, from 54.6.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",China services sector expands at steady clip in May but new orders wobble: Caixin PMI,"(Reuters) - China's services sector expanded at a steady, solid pace in May, with companies accelerating hiring on the back of the strongest optimism for future growth in 11 months, a private survey showed on Tuesday.
However, companies reported slower growth in new orders and weaker pricing power pointed to intense competition even as input costs rose at a faster pace.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) was unchanged in May from April at 52.9, indicating steady expansion though at a slightly slower pace than earlier in the year. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
The findings were roughly in line with those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector released last week, which showed the services PMI rising slightly in May.
China is banking on a stronger services sector to offset a smaller contribution from heavy industry and fixed asset investment as policymakers look to emphasize more sustainable economic growth.
A solid services sector is also important for generating new jobs as factories become more automated and the government looks to remove industrial overcapacity, putting redundant employees out of work.
The services sector already accounts for more than half of China's economy, with rising wages giving its consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
The new business sub-index in Tuesday's PMI fell to 52.5 in May from 53.0 in April, though companies hired at the fastest pace since January.
Input prices rose at a slightly faster pace, with companies saying the higher costs were driven by higher wages and transportation-related costs.
But prices charged increased at a slower pace, the survey showed, with companies citing tough competition.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors also remained steady in May at 52.3, suggesting economic growth remains relatively resilient despite worries about rising borrowing costs, cooling investment and trade tensions with the United States.
""The index of expectations regarding future output rose to a relatively high level, suggesting optimism across both the manufacturing and service sectors,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, in a statement along with the data.
""However, the impact of the recent credit contraction on small businesses is worthy of attention.""

Beijing is in the third year of a crackdown on riskier types of financing, which is making it more difficult and more expensive for some private firms to access funding.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian inflation likely held below the official target range in May, a Reuters poll of economists showed, before shifting up a gear in June due to the effects of a nationwide truckers' strike.
Consumer prices tracked by the benchmark IPCA index probably rose 2.73 percent in the 12 months through May, according to the median estimate of 22 forecasters. 
That would be slightly above a 2.70 percent reading in mid-May but still below the 2.76 percent rate at the end of April, as a weak economy continues to hamper the central bank's efforts to lift inflation back to its target range.
The bank targets a 4.5 percent year-end inflation rate, with a tolerance margin of 1.5 percentage points up or down. It undershot its goal for the first time ever last year and has since cut interest rates to an all-time low.
Double-digit unemployment rates and widespread idle capacity have kept a lid on price hikes as Latin America's largest economy slowly recovers from its deepest recession in decades.
Yet inflation is likely to get an unexpected boost in June after protesting truckers nearly paralyzed several industries in the final weeks of May.
""As this major strike is primarily a negative supply shock, gasoline and food prices have jumped,"" economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) told clients in a note. ""We think fuel prices will normalize relatively fast as the fuel trapped on the roads and at companies is delivered.""
""However, the strike appears to have generated permanent losses in the food sector, as perishable products had to be discarded and other inputs (such as livestock feed) ... were not delivered, leading to losses of livestock and at breeders.""
JPMorgan revised up their forecast for June inflation to a 0.94 percent monthly increase, from 0.62 percent previously. This would help inflation end the year at 3.9 percent, up from a previous forecast of 3.6 percent, the note said.
That would be a sharp upswing from a median estimate of a 0.30 percent increase in consumer prices in May in the Reuters poll. The release is scheduled for Friday at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT). 

Several economists have also downgraded their 2018 gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts in the wake of the trucker strike. Highway blockages also contributed to a smaller-than-expected trade surplus in May.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2018 10:48AM ET</span>",Weak demand for aircraft hurts U.S. factory orders,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in April, weighed down by declines in demand for transportation equipment and machinery, but the underlying trend continued to suggest strong momentum in the manufacturing sector.
Factory goods orders decreased 0.8 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday. Data for March was revised up to show orders rising 1.7 percent instead of the previously reported 1.6 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders falling 0.5 percent in April. Orders advanced 8.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in April. 
The monthly decline in factory orders is likely to be temporary amid reports of strong manufacturing conditions in May. A survey by the Institute for Supply Management last week showed sentiment among manufacturers perking up in May amid a surge in new orders.
Manufacturers, however, complained about rising prices for raw materials, especially for steel. The Trump administration in March announced tariffs for steel and aluminum imports to protect domestic industries from what it says is unfair competition from foreign producers.
Prices are likely to rise even higher following Washington's decision last week to extend the duties to steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Some manufacturers also said they could not find skilled workers.
The Federal Reserve's latest ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts described manufacturing as having ""shifted into higher gear"" in late April and early May. But the U.S. central bank also said ""contacts continued to report difficulty filling positions across skill levels.""
STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by strong domestic and global demand. 
U.S. stock indexes were higher in early trading on Monday while prices of U.S. Treasuries were weaker. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies.
Orders for transportation equipment fell 6.0 percent, pulled down by a 28.9 percent plunge in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft. Transportation orders increased 6.9 percent in March. Orders for motor vehicles rose 1.0 percent in April.
Orders for machinery dropped 0.7 percent after tumbling 3.1 percent in March. That reflected a decline of 11.6 percent in orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery. Orders for industrial machinery fell 10.0 percent. 
But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 1.8 percent. There were also increases in orders for fabricated metal products and primary metals.
Unfilled orders at manufacturers rose 0.5 percent in April. They have increased in five of the last six months. Manufacturing inventories increased a moderate 0.3 percent, which also bodes well for factory production.
The Commerce Department also confirmed that April orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, increased 1.0 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods fell 1.0 percent in February. 
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.9 percent in April instead of the 0.8 percent gain reported last month.
Core capital goods shipments fell 0.7 percent in March and were up 8.4 percent year-on-year in April. Business spending on equipment is slowing after double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. 

The moderation is occurring despite the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which came into effect in January. The government slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy grew for a fifth straight quarter in January-to-March and at a faster pace than in the previous three months, helped by stronger exports, the statistics service (ELSTAT) said on Monday.
Seasonally adjusted data showed gross domestic product grew 0.8 percent in the first quarter compared to an upwardly revised 0.2 percent in October-to-December.
The data suggests that Greece's recovery is gaining traction after a lengthy recession in which national output shrank by 25 percent, boosting hopes that it will successfully emerge from years of bailouts in August when its current aid program ends.
In year-on-year terms, Greece's expansion accelerated to 2.3 percent in the first quarter from an upwardly revised 2.0 percent growth rate in the last quarter of 2017.
""It was the strongest annual pace of growth in a decade, with net exports the main driver, offsetting a negative base effect from investment spending,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas.
The data showed a positive GDP contribution from net exports with imports down 2.7 percent compared to the same quarter a year earlier and exports rising by 9.5 percent.
""The better-than-expected performance in the first quarter gives credence to official forecasts for full-year economic growth of around 2.0 percent this year,"" Magginas said.
The latest EU Commission forecast sees Greece's economy expanding by 1.9 percent in 2018, while the International Monetary Fund projects growth of 2.0 percent.
The data also showed gross capital formation fell 8.3 percent year-on-year while private consumption rose 1.3 percent.

Adding to other signs that Britain's overall economy was picking up after a January-March slump, the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) held at 52.5, unchanged from April's modest growth rate after a sharp contraction in March.
That was above the median forecast of 51.9 in a Reuters poll of economists.
The Bank of England is looking for signs that the near-stagnation of Britain's economy in early 2018 was only temporary before it resumes its plan to gradually raise interest rates. 
""Activity in May was once again buoyed by some firms still catching up from disruptions caused by the unusually poor weather conditions in March,"" Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, said. 
""A renewed drop in new work hinted that the recovery could prove short-lived,"" he said.
New order books shrank for the fourth time in five months with companies blaming political and economic uncertainty ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union in March next year. Optimism about growth prospects fell to a seven-month low.
Also worrying for construction firms, higher fuel and steel prices pushed up input costs.
Construction accounts for only around 6 percent of British economic output.
A PMI survey covering Britain's manufacturers, which was published on Friday, showed growth in the factory sector picked up in May but showed signs of weakness ahead.

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>","Euro zone investor morale falls on Italy fears, U.S trade dispute: Sentix","BERLIN (Reuters) - Investor morale in the euro zone deteriorated for the fifth month in a row in June to its lowest level since October 2016, hit by concerns about an anti-establishment government taking power in Italy and a trade dispute with the United States.
Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to 9.3 from 19.2 in May. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a fall to 18.4. The fall was due to investors' weaker assessment of current conditions and lower economic expectations, which fell to their lowest level since August 2012.
""The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors,"" Manfred Huebner, managing director at Sentix, wrote in a note.
An Italian governing coalition of two parties generally seen as hostile to the euro took power on Friday, calming markets that had been spooked by the possibility of a new election that might have effectively become a referendum on whether to leave the single currency.
But investors remain nervous, since the coalition promises to increase spending, slash taxes and challenge European Union fiscal rules, which would add to Italy's debt pile.
A Sentix index for Germany fell for the fifth month in a row, as the economy faces headwinds from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union that took effect June 1.
After failing to win trade concessions, the Trump administration withdrew on Thursday exemptions from the global tariffs which had been given to steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico.
The EU has taken the first step in taking the United States to the World Trade Organization to challenge the legality of the new tariffs and the Trump administration's national security justification. Brussels has submitted an eight-page list to the international trade body, covering goods it would hit with retaliatory measures.

Sentix conducted the survey of 920 investors between May 31 to June 2, one day after the U.S. tariffs went into effect.

1679,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 04, 2018 04:32AM ET</span>",UK Construction PMI Holds Steady at 52.5 in May,"Investing.com - Activity in the UK construction sector held steady last month, according to a closely watched business survey released on Monday.
Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index remained unchanged at 52.5 in May, compared to forecasts for a reading of 52.0.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS Markit highlighted that activity growth remained subdued in May as new business growth slipped back into decline amid general uncertainty towards outlook.
The research firm also noted that input price pressures sharpened on the back of higher fuel and steel costs.
IHS Markit economist Sam Teague indicated that, though the rebound was “somewhat underwhelming”, it still represented a recovery for the second quarter after the contraction seen at the beginning of the year, although he warned that it may be short-lived.
“Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signaling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter,” he said.
“Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May,” Teague added.
“With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook,” Teague concluded."
1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2018 01:24AM ET</span>",Australian corporate profits rise but consumer headwinds persist,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian companies doled out a record amount in salaries last quarter, providing support for a struggling consumer sector while a jump in profits pointed to economic growth gathering pace after last year's slowdown.
Stronger-than-expected data released on Monday suggested first-quarter economic growth might be faster than current consensus forecasts, sending the Australian dollar  up a third of a U.S. cent to the day's high of $0.7615.
The gross domestic product (GDP) report due on Wednesday is expected to show domestic output rose 0.8 percent in the first quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists. That would take annual growth to 2.7 percent, still below government and central bank forecasts of a 3.0 percent increase.
Australia's A$1.8 trillion ($1.37 trillion) economy has now entered its 27th straight year of growth but analysts see headwinds from the household and property sectors.
""We still expect Australian growth in 2018 to be a little below the Reserve Bank of Australia's forecast because of a constrained consumer and a slowing housing market,"" said Diana Mousina, senior economist at AMP Capital. 
""There are few signs of noticeable cost pressures as the economy is still running below its capacity,"" Mousina added.
""Growth needs to be stronger to work through this spare capacity and lift wages and inflation."" 
Australia's center-right government has recently committed to expensive education and health programs and cuts to personal income tax to win over struggling households as elections loom.
The mix of moderate growth and restrained wages poses a political challenge for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and is a major reason the RBA is expected to keep interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent at its June meeting on Tuesday. 
Interest rates have been on hold since August 2016, marking the longest period of unchanged policy since the cash rate was introduced in 1990. The futures market <0#YIB:> is not fully pricing in a hike until September next year.
JOBS AND GROWTH
Monday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed company gross operating profits climbed 5.9 percent to a record in the March quarter, beating expectations for a 3.0 percent increase. 
Mining, construction, utility and recreation enjoyed hefty increases while financial services recorded the biggest fall.
Another bright spot in Monday's data was stronger-than-expected business inventories, which climbed 0.7 percent in the March quarter compared with expectations of 0.1 percent rise.
The solid performance allowed companies to hire more, inflating their wage bill to a record A$135.5 billion ($103 billion) in the March quarter, up 0.8 percent on the previous quarter and 5.0 percent higher than a year ago.
The appetite for labor also showed few signs of diminishing, with job ads holding near a seven-year peak.
A survey by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) on Monday showed weekly job ads in newspapers and on the internet up a brisk 11.5 percent in May from a year ago.
Yet, companies are still reluctant to reward pay hikes with annual wage growth crawling at around 2 percent, its slowest pace ever.
That has weighed on consumer spending with the household debt-to-income ratio hold near all-time highs of around 190 percent. 
Still, retail sales rose 0.4 percent in April, Monday's data showed, compared with a flat result in the previous month and expectations for a 0.2 percent increase.
Annual retail sales of more than A$315 billion account for almost 18 percent of GDP. Overall, household consumption accounts for around 57 percent of the country's annual output, meaning a revival in consumer spending is necessary for steady economic momentum.
""With household finances still under pressure from low wage growth, rising petrol prices and a slowing housing market, we expect the annual rate of consumption growth to slow from about 3.0 percent in the first quarter to around 2.0 percent by the end of the year,"" said Capital Economics analyst Kate Hickie.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's trade surplus shrank more than expected in May, weighed down by nationwide truckers strikes that blocked key highways in Latin America's largest economy.
The trade surplus fell 22 percent from the year before to $5.981 billion, data from the trade ministry showed, lagging behind a median estimate of $7.5 billion in a Reuters survey of economists. <BRTBAL=ECI>
The results highlight how widespread protests against rising fuel prices that began on May 21 are affecting Brazil's economic recovery.
Exports averaged $1.063 billion a day in the first three weeks of the month, before the strikes kicked off, but that fell 36 percent to $678 million in the last two weeks of May. Meanwhile, average daily imports fell 26 percent to $516 million in the same time period.
""Business does not get done if there's no way to ship merchandise,"" Herlon Brandão, head of export statistics for Brazil's trade ministry, told reporters in a news conference.
Yet that impact was not big enough to drive policymakers to revise their forecast for 2018, which sees a trade surplus of around $50 billion, he added.
Losses were widespread, with exports of manufactured goods leading declines with a 46 percent drop. In comparison, semi-manufactured good exports fell 37 percent and basic material exports decreased 31 percent.
Exports of products such as oil and iron ore are typically moved by ships or railways, which shielded them against the effects of the truckers' strike, Brandão said.
Soybean and meat exports were sturdy, mostly due to stockpiles in ports, though they could still suffer in the short-term.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, pointing to rapidly tightening labor market conditions, which could stir concerns about inflation.
The closely watched employment report released by the Labor Department on Friday also showed wages rising solidly, cementing expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month and boosting the probability of two more hikes later in the year. It renewed fears about the economy overheating. 
""The strength of the labor market supports our forecast for the Fed to raise rates three more times this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is going to get antsy that the labor market will blow too far past full employment.""
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs last month as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. There were also big gains in retail and leisure and hospitality payrolls. The economy created 15,000 more jobs than previously reported in March and April. 
Last month's one-tenth of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate pushed it to a level last seen in April 2000. The jobless rate is now where the Fed forecast it would be by the end of this year.
Average hourly earnings rose eight cents, or 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in April. That pushed the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in April.
The strong employment report added to a string of upbeat economic data, including consumer spending, industrial production and construction spending, that have suggested economic growth was regaining speed early in the second quarter after expanding at a moderate 2.2 percent annualized rate in the January-March period.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 4.8 percent pace in the second quarter. The strength comes even as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion income tax cut package and increased government spending is yet to be felt.
But there are dark clouds on the horizon. A decision this week by the Trump administration to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union has renewed fears of a trade war, causing financial market volatility. Trouble has also been brewing in Europe.
Some economists believe the political tensions in Europe and a protectionist domestic trade policy could dissuade the Fed from taking a more hawkish stance when policymakers meet on June 12-13. Traders, however, raised bets for four rate hikes this year. 
The U.S. central bank lifted borrowing costs in March and forecast at least two more rate increases for this year. Inflation is running just below the Fed's 2.0 percent target.
U.S. Treasury yields rose and the dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
BROAD JOB GAINS
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 188,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate steady at 3.9 percent. 
Monthly job gains have averaged about 179,000 over the last three months, more than the roughly 120,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Though the labor market is viewed as being close to or at full employment, there is still some slack remaining. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.7 percent last month from 62.8 percent in April. It has declined for three straight months.
Still, the labor market is getting tighter. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 7.6 percent last month, the lowest since May 2001, from 7.8 percent in April.
With job growth expected to slow as employers struggle to find qualified workers, economists expect wage growth will pick up significantly. There is growing anecdotal evidence of worker scarcity. 
A report from the Fed this week showed shortages of truck drivers, sales personnel, carpenters, electricians, painters, and information technology professionals.
""As labor becomes increasingly scarce, we expect to see further strengthening in average hourly earnings,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at Well Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Job gains in May were across all sectors. Construction payrolls increased by 25,000 after rising by 21,000 jobs in April. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed construction spending surging in April.
Manufacturers added another 18,000 jobs last month on top of the 25,000 created in April. Further gains are likely, with a survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Friday showing a pickup in factory activity in May. 
The survey suggested manufacturers, especially in the food, beverage and tobacco product industries, were starting to run into labor supply issues. There were also complaints about soaring prices, partially brought about by the steel tariffs. 

Government payrolls increased by 5,000 in May, reversing April's 3,000 drop. Retailers boosted employment by 31,100 jobs last month. Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 21,000 jobs.

Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.4 in May, compared to forecasts for a reading of 53.5.
The prior month’s reading was 53.9.
Despite the better-than-expected reading, IHS Markit highlighted that the acceleration masked underlying weakness.
“At first glance, the mild acceleration in the rate of output growth and rise in the headline PMI would appear positive outcomes given the backdrop of the slowdown seen in manufacturing since the turn of the year,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
“However, scratch beneath the surface and the rebound in the PMI from April’s 17-month low is far from convincing,” he warned.
Dobson explained that the slowdown in new order inflows meant that the expansion was only achieved by firms working through their backlogs.
He further noted that weaker than expected sales led to the biggest rise in unsold stock in the survey’s 26-year history.
“Price and supply headwinds, combined with a further slowdown in new order growth, could jeopardize any further expansion of the manufacturing sector,” Dobson concluded."

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing, which accounts for about 10 percent of the Greek economy, rose to 54.2 from 52.9 in April. Readings above 50 denote expansions in activity; below 50, a contraction.
""May saw the recovery in the Greek manufacturing sector reach an important milestone, with output now having risen on a monthly basis throughout a year,"" said Andrew Harker, IHS Markit associate director.
Driving the expansion in output was a rise in new orders at home and from abroad. Growth in export business hit a three-month high in May.
""Encouragingly, rates of growth in production, new orders and employment all picked up from the previous month. The road to recovery remains long, however, after a number of years of decline,"" Harker said.
Greece's debt crisis in late 2009 led to a long recession and multiple bailouts, which Athens hopes to exit in August, when its current, third rescue program expires.
The country's jobless rate, at 20.8 percent in February, remains the highest in the euro zone.
Greek manufacturers continued to take on new workers in May, responding to higher output requirements, with the pace of job creation just below a record high hit in March.
Inflationary pressures intensified in May, the survey showed, as both input costs and output prices rose at sharper rates compared to April. Firms reported higher costs for raw materials such as metals and oil.

LONDON (Reuters) -
Euro zone factory growth slowed to a 15-month low last month, hampered by extra holidays, and forward-looking indicators suggest it will at best remain subdued in coming months, a business survey showed.
After peaking at the turn of the year, growth has weakened across the bloc - although it remains relatively strong, giving the European Central Bank room to move away from its ultra-easy policy this year.
The ECB will finish its stimulus program by the end of 2018, according to a Reuters poll of economists last month, although nearly half of those surveyed said it was not in control of inflation, which had remained stubbornly below target [ECILT/EU].
But prices in the bloc rose to a faster-than-expected 1.9 percent last month from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, pretty much spot on the ECB's target.
Higher prices appear to have hurt demand, and IHS Markit's May final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the bloc slipped for a fifth month, falling to a 15-month low of 55.5 from April's 56.2, in line with a flash reading. Anything over 50 indicates growth.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday and is considered a good guide to economic health, fell to an 18-month low of 54.8 from 56.2.
""Some of the weakness may have been related to a higher than usual number of holidays during the month, but risks appear tilted towards growth remaining subdued or even cooling further in coming months,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""There are signs that the soft patch has further to run.""
New orders growth was at a 19-month low, hiring rates were at a 14-month low, while backlogs of work were built up at the slowest rate since September 2016.

Exports rose 13.5 percent in May from a year earlier, while imports jumped 12.6 percent, leaving a trade surplus of $6.73 billion. South Korea releases its trade data earlier than most other major economies, making it a bellwether of global demand.
The results topped expectations after a stretch of downbeat data had raised concerns about the health of the nation’s economic recovery. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol last week cited rising uncertainties for the central bank’s decision to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged.
South Korea Inflation Slows, Moving Away From BOK Target
Semiconductor shipments, which dominate South Korea’s exports, rose 45 percent in May to a record $10.9 billion, perhaps easing concerns about a slowdown in the technology cycle. Data released on Thursday showed the nation’s semiconductor output drove industrial production to a better-than-expected 3.4 percent increase in April from the previous month.
""The export growth rate may fluctuate going forward, depending on base effects from last year’s monthly data, but I expect overall export values to remain good,"" said An Ki-tae, an economist for NH Investment & Securities in Seoul. ""Even after excluding semiconductors, other sectors like petroleum products and machinery are rising.""
Growing trade protectionism and a slowdown in emerging economies are risks to the positive outlook, the trade ministry said. While Korea managed to renegotiate its trade agreement with the U.S. without any significant harm to its position, the Trump administration continues to lash out at its closest allies with tariffs.
Shipments of petroleum products rose 38 percent and those of computers rose 29 percent.
Exports to China jumped 30 percent to $13.9 billion, the second-highest monthly total on record. Those to the U.S. rose 12 percent, while shipments to Japan jumped 16 percent. The trade ministry cited upbeat manufacturing activity in major economies, higher prices for oil and other major products, and a positive tech cycle.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Australia's Fair Work Commission raises minimum wage by 3.5 percent,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Fair Work Commission (FWC) has raised the minimum wage by 3.5 percent from July 1, it said on Friday, an increase almost double the current industry rate but half what unions had lobbied for.
The move affects about 2.3 million employees, or 20 percent of Australia's workforce, and was opposed by business groups who argued that higher pay awards would kill jobs.
But research published by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in May convinced the commission that ""modest and regular minimum wage increases do not result in dissemployment effects or inhibit workforce participation,"" the FWC said.
The A$24.30 per week increase in the minimum wage will be welcomed by central bank policymakers who want to see a pick up in wage growth and inflation before they normalize interest rates from the current record low 1.50 percent.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe has recently called for average annual wage increases of 3.5 percent to achieve average inflation of 2.5 percent, the mid-point of the bank's target. The last time wages grew as fast as 3.5 percent was in the third quarter of 2012.
Annual wage growth in Australia has been stuck around 2 percent even as employment has boomed over the past year.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>","China May manufacturing sector growth steady, cost pressures returning: Caixin PMI","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector expanded at a steady pace in May as a pick up in production and domestic business offset a second month of declines in new export orders, a private survey showed on Friday. 
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) was unchanged at 51.1 in May from April, and just above economists' forecast for a slowdown to 51.0. 
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 12th consecutive month.
The output sub-index rose to 51.8 in May, a three-month high, while manufacturers also saw stronger domestic order growth and increased their purchases of inputs.
The Caixin survey suggests China's factories have maintained solid overall growth despite the government's war on industrial pollution, a slowing housing market, and trade tensions with the United States. 
Indeed, an official PMI released on Thursday showed the vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest clip in eight months, signaling broad economic resilience even though many analysts expected pressure on growth in coming months from rising financing costs and the global trade friction. 
Manufacturers in May were more optimistic about future growth prospects, the Caixin survey found, though there could be uncertainty about external markets as a reading on export orders was in contraction for a second month.
China's exports have maintained solid growth this year, in-line with broad strength among Asia's big exporters, though the rate of expansion has slowed from last year. 
But the United States, China's largest export market, said this week that it will continue to pursue action on Chinese imports, including tariffs, just days after Washington and Beijing announced a tentative solution to their dispute and suggested that tensions had cooled.
""The index for new export orders picked up in May, but remained in contraction territory, reflecting that the export situation was still grim,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the survey.
Inflation pressures are picking back up, as higher commodity prices pushed up input prices at the fastest pace in three months, the survey found, with CEBM's Zhong saying industrial products price gains can help boost manufacturers' profits. 
Manufacturers were able to raise their sales prices at the fastest pace this year, indicating stronger downstream demand was allowing factories to pass along most of their cost increases. 
Indeed, the spread of the input price sub-index over the output price sub-index was the lowest since October 2016.
An employment sub-index showed Chinese factories continued to shed workers, as companies said they were looking to cut costs.

NAR said its pending home sales index, which measures signed contracts for homes where transactions have not yet closed, fell 1.3% to a reading of 106.4 after increasing by 0.6% in the previous month.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 0.4% last month.
After two straight months of modest increases, pending home sales dipped in April to their third-lowest level over the past year, according to report.
NAR indicated that all major regions saw no gain in contract activity last month.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun explained that the demand for buying a home was very robust, but sales were hindered because of “severe housing shortages in much of the country”.
“The unfortunate reality for many home shoppers is that reaching the market will remain challenging if supply stays at these dire levels,” Yun said."

Marquette University and the Institute for Supply Management-Milwaukee said their seasonally adjusted index of manufacturing in the Milwaukee region climbed to 67.90 this month from 58.26 in April.
The index was still short of the 75.24 reached in February, which was the highest point ever since the data series began in 2006.
A reading above 50 indicates regional factory activity is expanding.
""Business is better than last year, but commodity prices, tariffs, and exchange rates are risks to our business this year,"" according to a respondent's reply cited in the latest survey.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book of regional economic conditions showed U.S. manufacturers increased output in late April and early May despite trade tension between the United States and its major trade partners.
The Marquette University and ISM-Milwaukee survey's component on new orders, a proxy of future activity, increased to 67.90 from 45.54 last month, while its production gauge improved to 71.06 from 59.14.
The barometer on the six-month outlook improved to 75.00 from 50.00 in April.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending records biggest gain in five months,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in April, a further sign that economic growth was regaining momentum early in the second quarter, while inflation continued to rise steadily.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 0.6 percent last month, the biggest gain in five months. Data for March was revised up to show spending rising 0.5 percent instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.4 percent. Spending was boosted by purchases of gasoline and other energy products. Nondurable goods purchases increased 0.9 percent. Outlays on services rose 0.5 percent, lifted by demand for household utilities.
Prices continued to gradually rise. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased 0.2 percent for the third straight month.
That left the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 1.8 percent. The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. The U.S. central bank has a 2 percent inflation target.
Economists expect the annual core PCE price index will breach the Fed's target in the coming months. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. It increased borrowing costs in March and has forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year.
The moderate inflation also helped support consumer spending last month. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in April after increasing 0.5 percent in the prior month. That suggests an acceleration in consumer spending after it grew at a 1.0 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the slowest pace in nearly five years.
The solid consumer spending added to data on trade and industrial production that have left economists anticipating a pickup in economic growth in the second quarter. Gross domestic product estimates for the April-June period are above a 3.0 percent rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter.

In April, personal income rose 0.3 percent after rising 0.2 percent in March. Wages increased 0.4 percent. Savings fell to $419.6 billion last month from $445.7 billion in March. The saving rate dropped to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent in March.

The report did little to alter the outlook for monetary policy, with the majority of traders expecting a rate hike at the Fed’s next meeting in June.
The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending May 26 decreased by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 from the previous week’s total of 234,000, the U.S. Department of Labor said.
Analysts expected jobless claims to stay at 234,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 222,250, up 2,500 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended May 19 fell to 1.726 million from 1.742 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an increase to 1.749 million.

Canada’s gross domestic product, or the broadest measure of goods and services produced in an economy, increased 0.3% in March, Statistics Canada said. The result topped economists’ expectations for 0.2%.
However, the economy grew less than expected year-over-year. The economy contracted on an annualized basis by 1.3%, compared to expectations for a rise of 1.8% and following a gain of 1.7% the prior month . Quarter-over-quarter the economy grew by 0.3% compared to 0.4% in February.
The weaker annualized data could decrease the likelihood that the Bank of Canada will raise rates again before the end of the year. The central bank, which has raised interest rates three times since July 2017, has said that future hikes will depend heavily on economic data. Experts expect a rate hike in September."
