In 2015, Marco co-founded ride-hailing company Juno, which was acquired in 2017 by the Israeli transportation company Gett for $200 million.', 'In the years after Juno was acquired, Marco changed his focus to making the world better. “There are obviously a lot of problems in the world, but the one that we felt was closest to our heart is the climate crisis.”', 'Marco began looking for technologies that could be used to combat climate change and in his research, he became connected with faculty members at Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, who were working on a technology that produces hydrogen in a nonconventional way.', 'That science became the framework for Marco’s next company, H2Pro, which is one of a crop of start-ups trying to speed the clean energy revolution by focusing on new ways to make hydrogen.', 'When hydrogen is burned in a controlled environment not exposed to the air, it generates energy in the form of heat, with water as a byproduct. (Hydrogen does make nitrogen oxides when burned in air, as does anything when it is burned in air.) By contrast, burning fossil fuels releases dangerous greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide.', 'Hydrogen is already a key commodity in a variety of industrial processes and in making ammonia fertilizer, which is critical to generate enough food to feed the global population. But because, when burned in a controlled environment it releases no greenhouse gas emissions, it’s also being explored as a potential fuel replacement for some hard to decarbonize sectors and for energy storage.', 'That said: pure hydrogen has to be produced — it does not exist on its own in abundant quantities on earth.', 'The cheapest way of producing hydrogen is from natural gas, but that process results in carbon dioxide emissions. The collection and storage of natural gas also inevitably leads to methane emissions, a dangerous greenhouse gas.', 'Another way of producing hydrogen is by breaking up water, H2O, into its component parts with electricity.', 'This is conventionally done with a water-splitting device called an electrolyzer. If it is powered with clean energy, it can be a clean pathway to generating hydrogen. It’s expensive, though, and that’s a problem.', 'To drive down the cost of hydrogen requires cheap energy, high efficiency and low cost of equipment, Marco said. And for hydrogen to be clean, or “green” according to the color-coded nomenclature, it also needs to be powered by renewable, or clean, energy.', 'H2Pro doesn’t have a hand in determining the price of renewable energy, but “the assumption is the cost of renewable energy is already fairly low, and will continue to get even lower,” Marco told CNBC.', 'In a typical electrolyzer, the hydrogen and oxygen are produced at the same time when the water is split. Having those two gasses together is dangerous because if hydrogen gas and oxygen gas are sparked (a possibility in an electric system), then they explode. To prevent this from happening, an electrolyzer must have a membrane to separate the oxygen and hydrogen gasses.', '“The membrane makes it a very, very complicated construct. And that construct causes electrolyzers to be expensive,” Marco told CNBC.', 'The H2Pro solution does not require a membrane to keep the hydrogen and oxygen separate, Marco says. It’s not technically an electrolyzer, since part of the process is not electrochemical.', 'Also, a typical electrolyzer is about 70% efficient, meaning that about 30% of the energy that goes into an electrolyzer gets lost to heat. The H2Pro technology will be 95% efficient, Marco said.', 'That’s because the H2Pro system generates its own heat in the reaction. “We don’t need to input heat into the system. It generates its own heat to maintain the reaction,” Marco told CNBC. “That heat doesn’t cost us anything.” (The science is explained in more detail in a Nature scientific paper here.)', 'The technology is still very early days, and was pioneered by three scientists at Technion: Hen Dotan, who’s now H2Pro’s chief technical officer, and professors Gideon Grader and Avner Rothschild.', 'H2Pro aims to have pilot systems being tested in 2023 and utility scale systems in 2024. On Tuesday, H2Pro announced it has raised $75 million from investors including Bill Gates’ climate tech investing fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and ArcelorMittal, a global leading steel and mining company. This most recent funding brings its total funding to $107 million.', 'If H2Pro can make green hydrogen, that could help decarbonize the process that makes steel, which is one reason ArcelorMittal invested.', '“Although the technology required to directly reduce iron ore using hydrogen still needs to mature, the greater challenge with this new method of ironmaking is the cost and availability of the energy input – green hydrogen,” Pinakin Chaubal, chief technology officer at ArcelorMittal, said in a written statement.  ', 'Along the way, Marco has learned one major lesson, “Hardware is more difficult,” he said. “With software, you write the code and you are ready to go. Hardware is slower, more complicated, more challenging.”', 'Manufacturing a product and dealing with supply chain problems and inefficiencies are among the reasons.', '“But at the same time, what I have here, which I did not have in my other companies, definitely not to this extent, is feeling that you’re saving the world,” Marco said. “And I think that’s worth the extra hassle.”']",-1

A dozen boreholes have been drilled, with the majority in Rutherglen, a town southeast of Glasgow.', 'According to those behind the project, both Glasgow and Rutherglen were home to some of the busiest coal mines in Scotland. After their closure, natural floods filled them with water of about 12 degrees Celsius.', 'Mike Stephenson, who was until recently executive chief scientist for decarbonization at the British Geological Survey, told CNBC that the project was about “doing research on the heat in coal mines and also, to some extent, whether you can store heat in old coal mines.”', 'Stephenson said that at the site where the work is taking place, the team was “experimenting with … how fast water flows amongst these mines, how warm the water is, how … fast, if you take warm water out, does the water replenish — so how fast does the warmth come back.” “It is a research site, not a demonstration,” he said.

In summer of 2020, natural gas industry stakeholders suggested using blue hydrogen in the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure to heat homes.', 'But Howarth and Stanford professor Mark Jacobson published a research paper in August showing that was a bad idea.', '“The bottom line is that blue hydrogen has huge emissions and cannot be used except at low percentages in the current gas system,” Howarth told CNBC. “It is far cheaper to instead move to electrically driven heat pumps for heating.”', 'Other critics say the problems with hydrogen are more fundamental.', 'The process of producing hydrogen, compressing it, and then turning that compressed hydrogen back into electricity or mechanical energy is grossly inefficient, according to Paul Martin, a chemical process development expert and member of the Hydrogen Science Coalition.', '“It’s worth putting up with a lot of problems with a battery because for every one joule you put in, you get 90% of it back. That’s pretty great,” Martin told CNBC. In producing and storing hydrogen, you get only 37% of the energy back out. “So 63% of the energy that you said, is lost. And that’s best case.”', 'But the idea of using hydrogen as a fuel is bogus, said Martin, who calls himself a life-long environmentalist.', '“The people that are really behind this hydrogen push are the fossil fuel industry, because without it, what are they going to do? The fossil fuel industry without fossil fuels is basically the petroleum chemicals and materials business, which is about 25% of the current business.”', 'Still, Martin thinks pursuing green hydrogen is important for all its other uses, like industrial processes and the Haber-Bosch process, which converts hydrogen and nitrogen to ammonia to use in fertilizer. The Haber-Bosch process is credited with massively increasing food production and helping to feed the earth’s exploding population over the last 100 years.', '“I don’t want people to think I’m anti-hydrogen. I think making green hydrogen is super-important,” Martin said.', '“But it’s also super important to use it for the right things and not dumb things.”']",-1

She said that “some could pay more in our country that are not currently.”', 'Psaki later added: “I can assure you that when the president lays out his infrastructure plan, he will also lay out a plan to pay for it.”', 'The administration has revealed few specifics, but some administration officials have raised eyebrows with their comments.', 'Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday suggested to CNBC that several possible levies, including a vehicle mileage tax, could be on the table to finance the infrastructure project.', 'He later said a gas or mileage tax would not be part of the plan.', 'In the wake of the polarized fight in Congress over the latest Covid relief bill, administration officials have signaled they don’t want to shut Republicans out of future talks.', '“Throughout this process, we look forward to working with a broad coalition of members of Congress to gather their input and ideas, and determine the path forward,” Psaki said Monday.', 'She also declined to take a stance on whether Biden supports the reported efforts by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to enable the evenly split Senate to pass more legislation through budget reconciliation. The process would allow Democrats to pass a bill without Republican votes.', '“The White House and the President will leave the mechanics of bill-passing to Leader Schumer and other leaders in Congress,” Psaki said.', 'Once the package is unveiled, the administration’s focus is “on having that engagement and discussion with members of Congress.”', '“If they share a goal of building our infrastructure for the future but don’t like the way he’s going to propose to pay for it, we’re happy to look at their proposals,” she added.', '“If they don’t want to pay for it, I guess they can propose that too.

The company, which employed some 30 people at the time, is a domestic manufacturer, making kegs out of American-made steel.', 'Today, activity at the company’s manufacturing facility has cooled off and it’s staff has been slashed by a third to close to 20 people. Production has slowed from three shifts making about 275 kegs a day to between one-and-a-half and two shifts producing 175 kegs daily. As demand for domestic steel has increased in the wake of the tariffs, so too have prices — and there’s only so much cost the company can pass on to its customer base of small craft brewers and wineries.', '“We had high hopes it was going to impact our business in a good way,” says Kellby Ochs, production manager at the Pottstown, Pennsylvania-based company. “That’s not the case. Almost immediately the price of steel shot up through the roof. It had a pretty dramatic effect on our company.”', 'The other rub — there’s an import duty on steel, but not on imported steel kegs themselves. That means Chinese-made half-kegs shipped into the U.S. are still about $20 a piece cheaper than those American Keg is producing.', '“We just slowly saw the price of domestic go up and up, so we had to, in turn, raise our pricing to keep our margins up a little bit. And while this is happening, there’s still zero dollar import tariff on finished import kegs coming into the country. So it was just widening the gap between our price and theirs,” said Brian Luzzi, American Keg’s director of sales and marketing.', 'Companies like American Keg have been suffering the unintended consequences of Trump’s tariffs, and earlier this week business groups headed to Washington, D.C., to warn the U.S. trade representative that proposed new tariffs on China will further drive up costs on U.S. companies and force Americans to pay more for everything from cradles to coffins.', '“USTRs proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports dramatically expands the harm to American consumers, workers, businesses, and the economy,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in written testimony.', 'While most businesses argued that tariffs hurt American businesses and lead to higher costs, a few companies praised the tariffs or asked that they be extended to other products.', 'American Keg was one of them.', 'CEO Paul Czachor was in Washington on Wednesday to testify in support of the additional $200 billion being proposed in tariffs on specific goods from China. He said the list of products includes an important item — finished steel kegs — the same ones that are being imported and taking market share from his company.', 'Czachor said stainless steel prices for the materials he’s using have increased by around 21 percent since the fourth quarter of 2017, when 232 tariffs were being discussed.', '“We lost a lot of customers who can’t pay these high prices. We have to try to stay afloat waiting for tariffs,” Czachor said. “Our overall opinion is that the 232 tariffs were probably justified but our position is that the administration has some unfinished business. They should look downstream at companies like ours.”', 'American Keg changed course several years ago when it decided to stop importing kegs from overseas and start manufacturing them stateside, also changing its name in the process to reflect domestic production. Ochs was the second hire on the production side five years ago, and he said laying off good men and women he helped to bring on the team hit home.', '″I hired every single one of our employees and I had to lay off about a third of them off. We used to run three shifts, this place used to be packed all the time. People had decent jobs. People had an income that they could count on,” he said. “One day you’re giving somebody a chance at employment, and the next day you’re telling them they don’t have a job anymore. It is personal.”', 'Now the company is in wait-and-see mode. Sales and marketing director Luzzi, who supported Trump in the election, said he understands what the president was trying to do with tariffs and American manufacturing and he still supports Trump.', '“I have to see how it shakes out. I may change my mind,” he said. “But again, I do understand what he was trying to do. We’re just caught up in the middle of it.”', 'The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.']",103

She believes the most-important provision is an extension of the Investment Tax Credit, which has been instrumental to solar’s growth. The ITC, which was extended in December 2020, was included in The American Jobs Plan, but did not make it into the infrastructure bill’s final iteration.', 'Hopper said support for domestic manufacturing is another priority for the trade group, noting that incentives around U.S.-based production could alleviate some of the supply chain bottlenecks the solar industry is currently facing.', 'Rising costs and a lack of clarity for the industry could harm President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate goals. Solar costs have dropped more than 70% over the last decade, according to the Department of Energy, but they need to decline further for increased adoption.', 'The department issued Wednesday a blueprint detailing how solar could go from around 3% of electricity generation today to 45% by 2050, but it will be nearly impossible without supportive policies. The study said the U.S. installed a record 15 gigawatts of solar during 2020.', 'Installations will need to double each year through 2025, before quadrupling from 2020′s levels annually between 2025 and 2030 if the U.S.′ climate goals are to be met.', '“This is a critical moment for our climate future but price increases, supply chain disruptions and a series of trade risks are threatening our ability to decarbonize the electric grid,” Hopper said.

Let’s see if you move.’”', 'He ticked off a list of companies that had closed factories in the state, calling attention to Leviton Manufacturing, a maker of light switches and electrical outlets found in homes and offices around the world, including Trump’s real-estate properties.', 'More from ProPublica: A prisoner in Gina Haspel’s black siteTreated like trashDid your employer ask you to sign away your right to talk? We want to know about it.', '“I buy a lot of Leviton switches,” Trump said. “I’m not buying ’em anymore.”', 'Fast-forward 18 months. Leviton now stands to benefit from a  bill that would eliminate the taxes the company pays to import an outlet it makes in China — not, as Trump vowed, raise them.', 'The bill’s supporters say it will get rid of punishing tariffs on raw materials and components that are critical to American manufacturing. But that’s not all it does. Tucked into the legislation are tariff waivers like the one Leviton requested, which exempt hundreds of finished consumer products — from microwaves to pillows to fishing rods — that used to be made in America.', 'Leviton qualified through a little-known provision that allows for waivers on finished products so long as there are no competing U.S. manufacturers. But Leviton wasn’t required to disclose that one of the reasons the outlets are no longer made in America is that the company  shut  down  four U.S. factories between 2005 and 2013, laying off more than 1,000 workers and shifting the work to Mexico and China.', '“The whole thing kind of stinks,” said Tom Kiefer, a toolmaker who lost his job of 21 years when the company’s Warwick, Rhode Island, factory closed. “It’s not made here because they sent it to China.”', 'The legislation, known as the  Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act, is emblematic of the contradiction at the heart of the country’s trade policy: Congressional Republicans and many Democrats who support the bill want to ease the tariff burden on corporations — no matter where they make their products — even as the Republican president promises to punish companies that don’t manufacture in the U.S.', 'The Trump administration has not commented publicly on the bill, which passed the House in January and is awaiting approval by the Senate. His aides have so far sent mixed signals, sending a letter to congressional staff expressing concerns only to later withdraw it. Their reticence runs contrary to the president’s very vocal opinions about trade. Trump resurrected the issue from a policy backwater and has shaken the global economic order this year with new tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. Taking aim at China, he recently threatened to slap tariffs on  hundreds of its exports in retaliation for the country’s  technology policies.', 'For now, the policy split in Washington means that later this spring, around the same time that Trump could impose tariffs on hundreds of products from China, Congress is expected to hand him a bill asking him to do the exact opposite — reduce or eliminate import taxes on finished products, including more than 400 from China.', 'Here’s just one bewildering example: The current bill would lower tariffs on electric delivery vans from China just nine years after the Obama administration spent  billions of dollars to try to build an electric-vehicle industry in the United States. Meanwhile, Trump’s top trade representative has specifically — and  publicly — vowed to raise import fees on China’s electric vehicles.', 'Many companies, including Leviton, are effectively asking for tax breaks on the same products that they used to make domestically, but that are now made overseas. Granting companies such waivers amounts to a reward for shifting jobs to other countries, some workers and U.S. manufacturers say, and only encourages others to follow.', 'To find companies seeking tax breaks after closing U.S. factories, ProPublica compared the 1,662 waiver requests in the bill to Labor Department data on workers who’ve lost their jobs due to international trade. The analysis found that the companies requesting waivers on finished goods have eliminated an estimated 175,000 jobs due to outsourcing and competition from foreign imports since 1975, when the Labor Department began keeping track. Measuring it a different way, the industries impacted by the bill have especially seen manufacturing leave the U.S. — with more than 150,000 jobs lost in the last decade alone.', 'Among those pressing the government to lower the tariffs on their foreign-produced goods are a slate of corporations many consumers view as quintessentially American. Whirlpool, Caterpillar, PetSmart and the Gap all submitted petitions to the U.S. International Trade Commission, saying the import taxes on certain kitchen appliances, clothing, pet supplies and equipment are unnecessary, even if they used to be made domestically.', 'The fitness-equipment company Nautilus, for example, is seeking  waivers for its Bowflex TreadClimber and other cardio machines, which it now imports from China.

Neither Nautilus nor Rubbermaid responded to calls or emails about their waiver applications.)', '“The whole idea of miscellaneous tariff bills is the bill should be for U.S. manufacturing — not retailers and importers,” said Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. “The exemptions here have really undermined the intent of Congress. Congress needs to look at this again.”', 'Supporters of the consumer-product waivers in the bill say it helps U.S. companies stay in business, even if they’ve moved parts of their operations to another country. “Everybody wants to make trade the boogeyman,” said Nicole Bivens Collinson, a lobbyist and former trade negotiator whose firm handled several requests. “Many times, it’s only because companies have been able to source some goods overseas that they’ve been able to maintain U.S. manufacturing.”', 'The National Association of Manufacturers, which has been the biggest proponent of the bill, declined to comment. But in a  blog post, it defended the inclusion of finished products, saying that eliminating the tariffs would lower prices for American consumers. Other supporters  note that the waivers last only three years and the rules cap the government’s financial loss on any one item.', 'While those claims are true, lifting those tariffs can still mean big tax breaks for some companies. For example, Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and agricultural company, requested suspensions on more than 100 products in the bill, including  aspirin. That means that it and other importers of those products would see $100 million in savings over three years — more than a third of it on items Bayer described as finished products, a ProPublica analysis found. Amazon didn’t request any waivers itself, but is listed as a likely beneficiary on $50 million worth of tariff reductions because it also imports the items.', 'Some small manufacturers have  objected to their competitors’ waiver requests, saying they still make the products in the United States. Others, like the trade association for U.S. textile manufacturers, have argued that including finished products  weakens the U.S. negotiating position by lowering trade barriers with other countries without concessions, such as requiring countries to open up their markets or raise their labor and environmental standards.', 'For Leviton, moving production overseas was perhaps an inevitable transition for a 112-year-old company whose timeline intertwines with America’s industrial history. The company took off by manufacturing a lamp holder for Thomas Edison’s light bulb and later made beaded chains for the dog tags soldiers wore in World War II.', 'Leviton declined to make executives available for interviews or to answer specific questions.

So did his brother-in-law, an aunt and two uncles.', '______________________________________________________________________________________________', 'Before Trump turned tariffs into a cudgel, they served various purposes, first generating revenue for the federal government before the income-tax system and later protecting domestic industries from foreign competition. Generally, unless a country is part of a separate free-trade agreement like the North American Free Trade Agreement, importers must pay a tax on products and materials they bring into the United States.', 'The current fees were set through various international negotiations over the past few decades that left U.S. tariffs relatively low compared with those of other countries. In exchange, American companies are able to sell their products overseas, even if they have to pay a higher tariff to do so. As a side benefit, leaders often hope that war is less likely among countries that do business together.', 'Many Americans blame low trade barriers for the loss of blue-collar jobs, but there is competing evidence.  Light trucks, which have far higher tariffs than cars, are mostly made in North America. But high import taxes on  sneakershave done little to prevent footwear companies from manufacturing in Asia.', 'Miscellaneous tariff bills were designed decades ago to help American manufacturers compete against foreign companies by dropping fees on imported chemicals, minerals and other necessary components that weren’t available domestically. But as global trade grew in the late 1990s and 2000s, the bills began to include finished consumer products that had no U.S. competitors.', 'About 750 of the 1,662 products included in the current bill are identified as finished goods, a ProPublica analysis found. (The National Association of Manufacturers says that only about 400 are finished products but declined to explain its numbers.) As recently as 2004, similar tariff bills contained only a few dozen.', 'Past bills granted waivers more informally. Companies and industry groups simply submitted requests to members of Congress, who reviewed them with government experts and inserted them into trade bills. But after House Republicans adopted a ban on earmarks in 2010, some lawmakers worried that the process could be seen as doling out special favors. As a result, a renewal of past tariff suspensions languished and no new ones were granted, costing businesses $750 million a year, according to the manufacturers’ association.', 'In 2016, Congress  created a more transparent system, requiring companies to file petitions with the International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency that provides expertise on trade to legislators and policymakers. The commission reviews the requests and makes recommendations to Congress, based in part on whether there is any relevant domestic manufacturing.', 'Many companies fit the original legislative intent of easing taxes on foreign components that are critical to manufacturing final products in the U.S. Lasko Products of Pennsylvania, for example, is the last remaining U.S. manufacturer of electric pedestal and desktop fans, but it imports the fans’ motors from China.', 'At a  congressional hearing last fall, the company’s chief operating officer, Ed McAssey,  said Lasko employs 638 workers who assemble the fans at its factories in Tennessee and Texas, earning an average of $16 an hour. The company used to make the motors domestically but couldn’t compete with cheaper foreign manufacturers. The tariff relief, McAssey said, “enables us to compete with suppliers in China who do not incur the costs of livable wages, health insurance and retirement contributions that we provide our employees.”', 'The bill’s supporters often trot out such textbook examples of small to midsize U.S. manufacturers that waivers help to compete. But they rarely mention the multinational corporations like  Mattel — or retailers, such as the  Home Shopping Network — that are also seeking tariff breaks on products that require no American manufacturing.', 'Inside the 500-page bill are tariff reductions for hundreds of such items: baby strollers, hiking boots, pimiento-stuffed olives, boxing gloves, coffee makers, toasters, plastic spoons and forks, sparklers and party poppers, nicotine gum, pet toys, pajamas, reusable grocery bags, leather belts, sweaters, glass vases, basketballs, unicycles, yoga mats and vertical waffle makers.', '“This is not what I ever thought the miscellaneous tariff bills were intended to do,” said Jennifer Hillman, a Georgetown University professor who worked on past bills as a Democratic congressional aide and served on the trade commission. “It’s supposed to benefit domestic companies that are manufacturing in the United States.”', 'Dan Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute, however, said that there’s good reason to get rid of tariffs on finished products as well as component parts.', '“You see an old textile mill in South Carolina with a rusty gate and a rusty chain around it and you see the blight in the town, you think this is the cost of trade liberalization,” Ikenson said. But what’s not seen, he said, are the jobs created by the extra money people have to spend because they pay less for imported clothes.', 'Indeed, in supporting the waiver requests, companies made little attempt to justify them as creating American manufacturing jobs. For its  request to eliminate import fees on microwaves, Whirlpool wrote, “This product supports U.S. marketing and distribution jobs and complements U.S.-assembled cooking products.” When the owner of Ann Taylor stores  requested a tariff suspension for women’s hats, the headwear company Dorfman Pacific submitted a public comment in support,  noting that “hats offer an extra layer of protection against skin cancer and premature aging.”', 'The International Trade Commission did  reject hundreds of requests from companies to include products in the bill after finding that doing so would harm U.S. manufacturers. And Congress culled the list further, removing items such as air conditioners, which would have been controversial after Trump made a big deal of stopping Carrier Corporation from moving a factory to Mexico.', 'But whether the companies’ decisions to close their own factories helped them qualify for the waivers was not part of the review — or perhaps even known to lawmakers.', 'ProPublica analyzed the trade commission’s database of approved requests against data from the Labor Department’s Trade Adjustment Assistanceprogram, which provides financial help and job training to workers who lose their jobs due to increased foreign imports and outsourcing. In calculating job losses, ProPublica excluded companies seeking waivers for components and focused solely on finished products. Because the trade database identifies products while the labor data uses industries, it’s not clear in every case if workers were making the exact same products or only similar products. But through additional reporting, several companies stood out.', 'Nautilus’ factory in Tulsa got its start churning out StairMasters during the fitness craze of the 1980s. The company had bought StairMaster out of bankruptcy, and by 2007, it appeared stable. The local press reported that business was so good that Nautilus was adding an assembly line and even bringing back jobs from overseas.', 'But just over a year later, Nautilus announced it was closing the factory. According to Labor Department records, 178 workers were affected as the company shifted some production to China and Taiwan. At the time, many companies still made fitness equipment in the U.S. But the trade-assistance data shows a cascade of layoffs followed Nautilus’ decision, as other companies like Core Industries and Icon Health & Fitness also closed their factories, affecting an additional 2,000 workers.', 'Rick Haselton, who helped design the TreadClimber, on which Nautilus is now seeking lower tariffs, said companies should face a penalty for moving manufacturing outside the U.S. “It helps them do their job a little cheaper,” he said. “But all these jobs like I was in — that was what I depended on. That was my bread and butter, my livelihood.”', 'The bill also seems to sacrifice high-tech manufacturing like electric vehicles. In 2010, Smith Electric Vehicles received a $30 million federal stimulus grant to build battery-powered trucks in Kansas City, Missouri. At the time, then-President Barack Obama toured the factory, telling workers they were “building the economy of America’s future.” But Smith suspended production at the end of 2013 and, in 2015, formed a joint venture with Chinese investors called Nohm.', 'The company has  asked Congress to eliminate the 25 percent tariff on electric commercial vehicles like the ones it makes in China.

Apple still has talented designers, and it will continue to release iPhones. The planning process for a complicated device like those Apple makes takes about three years. It’ll be awhile before we start to see the first products from Apple that won’t have any input from Ive.', 'But Ive’s announcement on Thursday does underscore a shift in the importance of the industrial design group at Apple. This small group had immense power, with offices on the top floor of Apple Park, and Ive reported directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook.', 'When Evans Hankey, vice president of Industrial Design at Apple and a longtime employee, takes over the design group, she will report to COO Jeff Williams, an executive best known for his operational skills, not his vision for product and design.', 'The subtle demotion of the industrial design group shows that Apple is increasingly emphasizing its online services, the power of its components and how its products seamlessly work together, as opposed to their design.', 'After all, the overall look and feel of an iPhone has barely changed year to year, and new models of Apple’s MacBook laptop sport the same general aluminum case as they have for the past few revisions. The design goal for most modern electronics is to disappear completely, driving focus to the screen. ', 'Other consumer electronics companies regularly outsource industrial design work to a handful of firms. But for the past two decades, Apple did its industrial design in-house, under the watchful eye of Ive. Thursday’s announcement also means that Apple will soon outsource parts of its design because Ive is starting a new creative firm, with Apple as its client.', 'When Ive spoke at an event in New York in 2017, it was striking how little he seemed to care for day-to-day business concerns, and how much he cared about objects and how they were made.', '“When you walk around the manufactured world, so much of it testifies to carelessness in human activity, in engineering, in aesthetics,” he said.', 'That’s what Ive did — sweat the little details, especially in Apple’s physical objects and how they’re manufactured, but not necessarily the strict numbers on a given iPhone’s bill of materials.', '“I have a problem with numbers, and I don’t really have much interest  in business,” Ive said.', 'Before Ive, gadgets were not typically made out of aluminum shells carved out of single blocks. Laptops had tiny trackpads. Less attention was given to new case materials like stainless steel or gold alloys, which were used in the iPhone X and Apple Watch.', 'It’s difficult to determine how much Ive’s physical designs contributed to Apple’s 20-year streak of growth, versus Apple’s software or marketing, but the look of the products was a big part of Apple’s brand.', 'Apple products looked different than other products in stores. For example, iPods regularly came in vibrant colors and odd shapes and with new, sometimes experimental interfaces — the iPod Shuffle didn’t even have a screen.', 'Industrial design was the first team Ive led at Apple, and it was rooted in the physical, which is why his lab is loaded with cutting-edge manufacturing equipment. People make things there. He explained his eureka moment in 2017 and how it involved creating an actual model.', '“I think you only really understand a material — its properties and attributes and, importantly, the opportunity the material allows — if you actually work it yourself,” Ive told Smithsonian. “And the most remarkable point in the whole process is when you make the first model. We might like it, we might not, but the first model you make, everything changes.”', 'That’s not how Cook usually describes the magic of Apple’s process.', 'He often falls back to a mantra centered around “only Apple,” which emphasizes how Apple controls its hardware, software and online services.', '“The most important things in Apple, one, a culture of innovation. This team is unbelievable in creating hardware and software and services and getting them all to work together. It just works,” Cook said in an interview with CNBC in January.', 'Increasingly, this mantra of the whole Apple experience over the individual product is showing up in Apple’s approach to business.', 'Last year, Apple said it would no longer disclose how many individual iPhones, Macs or iPads it sells.  Instead, Apple said that investors should focus on Apple’s base of hundreds of millions of users, and how much money the company can make from them.', 'Earlier this year, Apple held one of its famous media events, which generate a substantial amount of free marketing for the company. But Apple didn’t announce or release any new physical hardware or products, instead choosing to announce a credit card, video game bundle and streaming TV service. Even Cook said that it was “a very different kind of event,” given that Apple fans had come to expect new physical products at its events.', 'Apple will continue to release products. Hardware accounted for 80% of the company’s revenue for the most recent quarter that figures are available. COO Williams is an operations expert, and given that industrial design is the process of creating products that can be manufactured at scale, he’s a logical executive to lead the group.', 'But Williams, unlike Ive, is obsessed with business and numbers. It’s what he specializes in.', 'With Ive’s exit, Apple no longer has someone obsessed with physical and manufactured items reporting to Cook.

President Donald Trump has said he may slap tariffs of 20 percent or 25 percent on auto imports, and he has asked the Commerce Department to study whether vehicle imports threaten national security, the same argument the U.S. used to impose steel and aluminum tariffs.', 'At the same time, the U.S. has imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods, including the automotive sector, and China has retaliated with its own tariffs. China raised its tariffs on the U.S. automotive sector, and they are now 40 percent on vehicles that are mostly built by BMW, Daimler and Ford.', 'The U.S. exported 267,000 autos to China last year and has a trade surplus of $6.4 billion in the auto sector with China, but it has a deficit of about $32 billion in the automotive sector with Europe.', '“The Trump Administration knows that it needs a win on trade as the battle with China escalates,” says Dan Clifton, head of Policy Research at Strategas. Clifton said there are two possible options: a new agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement being renegotiated with Canada and Mexico, or a deal on European autos.', 'The tit-for-tat tariffs lobbed by the U.S. on Chinese goods Friday are not expected to affect the economy, but they could grow. So far there is not expected to be a major change in the prices of goods that consumers would feel broadly. Both the U.S. and China are expected to follow up with another $16 billion for a first round of tariffs, for a total of $50 billion. Trump has said he could put tariffs on as much as $500 billion in Chinese goods.', 'However, if the Trump administration could show a victory on one front, it could help ease concerns about the Chinese tariff escalation. An auto deal with Europe would be a positive, since it could also include eliminating existing tariffs — a win for Trump.', '”When you look at primary exports out of a lot of countries, it really is autos,” said Dec Mullarkey, managing director, investment strategies, Sun Life Investment Management. “If they could get resolution on that, it would go a long way to calming markets and calming a lot of the rhetoric around this, and getting cooperation going among certain allies.”', 'Clifton said European policymakers seem to be looking for a solution, though there are obstacles. “Germany seems to support the move to zero tariffs, although other parts of the EU are less certain. Additionally, the procedural roadblocks are significant. But momentum is building in this respect,” Clifton wrote in a note.', 'When criticizing the unfairness of European auto tariffs, Trump has called out Germany’s Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz vehicles. U.S. cars are subject to 10 percent tariffs when they are exported to Europe, compared with a U.S. tariff of 2.5 percent. The U.S., however, has a special tariff on pickup trucks of 25 percent.', 'Analysts note that the irony is that Daimler and BMW manufacture vehicles in the U.S., as do Japanese manufacturers Honda, Toyota and Subaru. Mercedes-Benz U.S. International says on its website that it manufactures 286,000 vehicles at its Tuscaloosa, Alabama, plant, exporting them to 135 countries last year. It says it exported 70 percent of the SUVs it produces, making it the second largest exporter in the U.S.', 'Daimler has warned that its profits could be hurt by the tariffs.', 'General Motors spoke out against the tariffs, warning if implemented they would lead to a “smaller GM.” It said if automakers did not pass on the higher costs, it could result in less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages. GM has 47 U.S. manufacturing facilities and employs about 110,000 people.', '“The overbroad and steep application of import tariffs on our trading partners risks isolating U.S. businesses like GM from the global market that helps to preserve and grow our strength here at home,” GM said.', 'In a recent study, the Peterson Institute for International Economics said if tariffs of 25 percent were placed on all imports of vehicles and auto parts, production in the U.S. would fall 1.5 percent and 195,000 U.S. workers could lose their jobs over the course of several years. The analysis assumed there were no countries exempted and the tariffs were also put on NAFTA partners. It said the trade action could affect about $200 billion of U.S. imports, not including the parts industry.', 'If other countries retaliated with similar tariffs, production could fall 4 percent and 624,000 jobs could be lost, Peterson said. Prices would rise for both imported and U.S.-produced vehicles, and companies would have to decide how much of the increased costs to pass on.', 'More than half of the vehicles purchased in the U.S. are manufactured domestically, with another 24 percent or so from Canada and Mexico. European imports make up 6.7 percent of the U.S. total.', 'Diane Swonk, Grant Thornton chief economist, said the auto sector is the one industry that is so linked in the global supply chain that a trade war in autos could hit profitability, impact workers and ultimately the economy. Already, the industry is taking pre-emptive actions.', '“Automakers are hoarding and building inventories in key ports from key countries ahead of tariffs. This has an impact too,” she noted, adding there could be a surge in imports and inventories followed by a bust.', 'According to Reuters, port officials in Jacksonville, Florida; Brunswick, Georgia, and Baltimore reported importing a combined 23,000 more cars in May than the same time last year, and exports rose sharply, with 39 percent more cars leaving Baltimore and 19 percent more exiting from Jacksonville. In Long Beach, California, vehicle imports were up 3.4 percent in May while exports were down 24 percent. Automakers using that port include Daimler and Toyota.', '“Autos are so important because they’re important in every country, and there is no such thing as a country border when you determine the content of an auto,” said Swonk. She said restrictions on the auto sector don’t work and aren’t good for consumers, as was evidenced when the U.S. put quotas on Japanese vehicles in the 1980s. “The reality is the world has changed a lot from the 1980s. The Japanese quotas were costing U.S. consumers over $3,000 per vehicle,” said Swonk.', 'The supply chain is so intertwined that U.S. auto production suffered from a parts shortage when the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan hurt the ability of parts makers to manufacture and export.', '“We don’t export and import. The cars we produce when we sell them are made from parts from all over the world,” she said. “Most things are not made 100 percent U.S. unless it’s 3-D printed here.”', 'Ethan Harris, Bank of America Merrill Lynch global economist, sees the next likely step in the trade battles as a bigger round of tariffs on Chinese goods, $100 billion or $200 billion. But then the auto sector may be targeted by the Trump administration.', '“Auto tariffs would represent a major step down the road to a full-blown trade war and if sustained could slice a few tenths or more off of global growth. Going the final step to across-the-board tariffs between the US and its trading partners would very likely cause a global recession. However, we still see that as a low-probability outcome,” Harris wrote in a note.', 'He said the next round of Chinese tariffs would already cause a bit more pain, since it would end up targeting more consumer goods, possibly wiping out the positives from the tax cuts.', '“It’s one thing to move steadily forward with tariffs when there are few visible costs. As tariffs continue to escalate, however, the signs of pain should become quite obvious to all parties. Spikes in consumer product prices like we have seen in washing machines would become frequent and front-page news. Export firms would start to lay people off. Consumer, business and market confidence would drop sharply. Public opinion would likely turn against the tariffs: “war” seems great when soldiers are marching to the front, but not so great when the casualties come home,” he wrote.']",1

But earlier in this month, Tokyo unexpectedly imposed tighter controls on one portion of that network: The supply of certain chemicals from Japan to South Korea.', 'Those chemicals are used by Korean manufacturers to produce semiconductors, and are crucial for making components — including memory chips, microprocessors and integrated circuits — that can be found in many modern-day electronic products.', 'Given the widespread use of semiconductors, companies that test and make them are often seen as a barometer for the health of the global economy.', 'Global sales of semiconductors grew 12.5% to reach $474.6 billion in 2018, according to research firm Gartner. Signs are pointing to falling sales this year with several large semiconductor companies slashing earnings estimates amid deteriorating demand.', '', 'Already, the U.S. and China are locked in a year-long trade war that has dampened the global growth outlook. Now with tensions between Japan and South Korea also heating up, it could make things worse.', '“The ongoing trade dispute between Japan and South Korea could have serious consequences to the global semiconductor industry if a resolution cannot be identified in the near term,” Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at consultancy IHS Markit, wrote in a note last week.', 'Japan announced on July 1 it would restrict exports of three chemicals to South Korea: fluorinated polyimide, resist and hydrogen fluoride. Those high-tech materials are used in the production of semiconductors and display screens. Tokyo cited “inadequate management” of the chemicals — which some reports said could be diverted for military use — as a reason to impose restrictions.', 'The curbs came into effect on July 4 and Japanese exporters must now seek permission each time they want to ship any of the three chemicals to South Korea. That process takes about 90 days.', 'In addition, Tokyo said it plans to strip South Korea off some preferential treatment in its trade ties with Japan. Such a move, which is expected by August, would involve removing South Korea from a “white list” of countries deemed trustworthy by Japan.', 'If Tokyo goes ahead with its plan, Japanese exporters will need licenses to ship to South Korea some 850 items that could be used in weapons-related applications, according to IHS Markit.', 'Japan produces around 90% of the world’s supply of fluorinated polyimide and resists, and about 70% of hydrogen fluoride. Japan’s global dominance of those chemicals will make it difficult for South Korean companies to source for alternatives when their supplies are disrupted by Tokyo’s exports curbs.', 'Even if they manage to find alternative sources, the companies “may either encounter quality issues or fail to get adequate supplies to fulfill their production orders,” according to a report last week by Lloyd Chan and Shigeto Nagai, economists at consultancy Oxford Economics.', '', 'South Korea is home to semiconductor giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, which supplied 61% of components used in memory chips globally in 2018, IHS Markit said. Any production disruption would be bad news for their customers, which include major tech companies Apple and Huawei.', 'For now, the two South Korean suppliers have “high” levels of semiconductor inventories that they can rely on, according to analysts from Citi. But when that’s drawn down, the chipmakers could have trouble meeting production deadlines if they fail to find alternative suppliers of the three chemicals in time.', 'Citi’s analysts estimated that at Samsung Electronics, inventories of the chemicals restricted by Japan could last the company 20-30 days. They didn’t provide inventory figures for SK Hynix, but cited a local media report as saying the company told customers “the current situation is manageable near-term.”', '', 'Still, any prolonged disruption of Japanese exports of the crucial chemicals to South Korea could cause a global shortfall in memory chips supply, and as a result, push up prices, warned Biswas from IHS Markit.', 'There could be a contagion effect, and the U.S. and China might also feel the pain given that both countries rely on supplies from South Korea, the economist noted. American electronics firms with production sites in both the U.S. and China, or either one of the two countries, are especially vulnerable, he said.', '“If supply constraints arise in South Korean memory chip production, the price of memory components could significantly increase due to the inability of the other memory suppliers to meet global demand,” said Biswas.', '“End products, including servers, mobile handsets, PCs and a variety of consumer electronics would be impacted,” he added.', 'As a result, consumers from all over the world may have to pay a higher price for those products.', 'Relations between Japan and South Korea have not always been warm. The Asian neighbors share a bitter history dating back to the Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945 during the World War II period.', 'The two countries signed a treaty in 1965 to restore diplomatic ties. But disagreements over what was settled in the treaty continued to strain their relationship in the decades that followed, with sticking points including the use of forced labor by Japanese companies and sexual slavery in wartime brothels.', 'Japan has not given much detail behind its trade actions against South Korea. But media reports suggest that Tokyo’s moves were in retaliation against a dispute about wartime forced labor.', 'In two separate rulings late last year, South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered two Japanese companies — Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries — to pay compensation to several Koreans for forced labor during the war.', 'Japan, which considers the issue of forced labor fully resolved in the 1965 treaty, denounced the rulings and is reportedly considering taking the dispute to the International Court of Justice. Tokyo has denied its exports curbs are related to the rulings.', 'In other Japanese media reports, South Korea was said to be allegedly shipping Japan’s hydrogen fluoride — one of the three chemicals in the restricted list — to North Korea.', 'Seoul denied those accusations and said it plans to raise the “unfairness” of Tokyo’s actions at the World Trade Organization’s general council meeting this week.', 'The Japan-South Korea trade dispute comes at a time when lingering tensions between the U.S. and China continue to dampen economic activity worldwide.', 'The downturn has already hit many trade-reliant economies and those along the electronics supply chain, including Japan and South Korea. That’s one reason why some analysts said they don’t expect the two countries to escalate the conflict and harm their respective economies even more.', 'In addition, because of how closely linked their economies are, Japan’s measures against South Korea “will lead to mutually assured destruction,” said Waqas Adenwala, Asia analyst at consultancy The Economist Intelligence Unit.', '“South Korea is an important export market for Japan. The producers of materials used in manufacturing of semiconductor devices will struggle to find new buyers,” Adenwala said in a note earlier this month.', 'Businesses in Japan will not be spared either.', '“Japanese companies producing electronic devices buy semiconductor components from South Korea and they will face delays in their production too,” he added.', 'For South Korea, the country’s reliance on Japan for high-tech materials, machinery and equipment will deter Seoul from escalating tensions, according to Oxford Economics’ Chan and Nagai.', '“We do not expect trade tensions to escalate to such an extent that businesses are severely affected, as Korea and Japan should have enough economic incentives to minimise the potential fallout,” the economists said.', '— Reuters and CNBC’s John Schoen contributed to this report.']",-1

It’s become a regular fixture of his energy policy speeches, and Trump has threatened to withhold permits that companies need to lay pipe on federal land if they don’t play ball.', 'But a group of six oil and gas associations warns the plan would disrupt established supply chains and send rising steel prices even higher. In some cases, American mills would simply be unable to meet the demand, they said.', '“Relying solely on U.S. pipeline grade steel and pipe production could lead to long construction delays and higher costs, potentially canceling planned pipeline projects or blocking new pipeline projects,” the associations said in comments to the U.S. Department of Commerce.', 'The organizations that contributed to the dozens of pages of analysis, submitted as part of a request for comments by Commerce, include the American Petroleum Institute, the American Gas Association and the Association of Oil Pipelines.', 'The U.S. steel industry does not currently make the type of steel used in many pipelines, but it says it is ready, willing and able.', '“We have all the necessary high-cost materials that would go into cost-effectively making steel, but we’ve got to have a leveled playing field to compete,” Doug Matthews, senior vice president at U.S. Steel, told CNBC. “That’s [why] we’re excited about with the administration’s push right now.”', 'The oil and gas associations argue that the government may have to incentivize steel makers and manufacturers to make pipeline-quality steel and line pipes because they are “among the slowest, most expensive products for domestic mills to produce.” Consequently, many mills would prefer to use their facilities to make less time- and cost-intensive products.', 'There are 40 to 50 mills that make line pipe for U.S. projects, about half of which are located in the United States, the trade groups estimate. When it comes to making large, technically sophisticated pipes, there are just a handful of American providers.', 'A boom in U.S. shale oil and gas production has driven an increase in construction of mills capable of churning out these products, but there are still only eight mills that make pipes with a diameter of 30 inches or larger. For pipes of that size that need to be a certain thickness, that number falls to three. No American mills make pipes of the highest grade, size and thickness.', 'The few mills capable of making these pipes would be further taxed by Trump’s insistence that manufacturers also use raw steel made in the U.S.', 'More than half of the steel plate and coil used to make these pipes is imported. Limiting imports of these inputs would actually hamper the ability of mills to manufacture pipes for U.S. projects, the groups said.', '“A decrease in the availability, or increase in cost, of these imported steel products could impact the production capabilities and economics of these domestic pipe mills, which could ultimately impact the steelworkers employed at these domestic facilities,” they said.', 'The companies that make valves and other equipment for pipelines also import parts for assembly in the United States.

Smart investors will go long on those firms.”', 'Bleistein and other observers view the recent scandals in Japan as a sign that transparency is growing amid a lower tolerance for malfeasance.', '“Quality and compliance in Japan remain paramount, but in a more transparent corporate environment, companies have learned that they have to come clean on mistakes and misconduct much earlier,” says Martin Schulz, a senior research fellow at Tokyo-based Fujitsu Research Institute. “Issues that would have been handled internally before are now becoming public and need to be managed with many more partners.

And since a new EU-Japan trade pact entered into force in February, European farmers and manufacturers are also benefiting from tariff cuts in Japan.', 'However, the rising tide of trade between Japan and its new trade agreement partners has meant lost sales for Americans. U.S. pork exports to Japan, the top export destination, have dropped by 35% so far this year. U.S. wheat and barley sales to Japan are also suffering. The trend extends to manufactured goods as well.', 'In response, the U.S. is poised to launch negotiations with Japan for a bilateral trade pact.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that about 4 percent of the aluminium and copper products that it shipped from September 2016 to August 2017 were falsely labelled as meeting the specifications requested by customers.  The misconduct involved dozens of staff and possibly stretched back 10 years, the company said.', 'The admission from the steel and aluminium maker follows similar scandals at Japanese companies including Nissan Motor, Mitsubishi Motors and Takata Corp. Toshiba Corp. is still battling the fallout of a scandal involving reporting inflated profits.  “The impact on financials is unclear, but could be substantial depending on request(s) for replacement/recall,” Jefferies analyst Thanh Ha Pham said in a note. “Handling the situation is key to avoid long-term reputation damage.”  UACJ, Japan’s biggest aluminium maker, may be a beneficiary of the scandal, he said. UACJ shares were up 3 percent at around 0354 GMT.  Shares of Kobe, on the other hand, looked set to plunge as sell orders outpaced bids by a factor of roughly 20 to one in early trade. The Tokyo bourse was closed for a national holiday on Monday. On Friday, the shares rose 2 percent to 1,368 yen.', 'Products with falsified data were shipped to about 200 companies, the company said at the weekend.  Aluminium castings, forgings and flat-rolled items, along with copper strips and tubes were among the products affected, the company said in a statement.  Companies including Toyota Motor Corp., Central Japan Railway, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp. were among those using products covered by the admission from Kobe Steel, according to media reports and statements.  Japan’s transport ministry has called for automakers to make safety checks of components from Kobe.  A Kobe spokesman told Reuters the firm is working with customers to check for any issues. “To our knowledge it has not affected any customer’s products at this stage,” he said.  Toyota called the revelations a “grave issue”, and as with most of the other Kobe Steel customers, said it was making checks on where the components were used and what effect they have on products using them.  Mitsubishi Heavy said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including a H-2A rocket launched on Tuesday to put a navigation satellite into orbit. There were no technical problems with the components, MHI said.', 'Kobe Steel has said the impact of the data falsification on its earnings is still unknown. An official from the metals division of Japan’s industry ministry is holding a press conference at around 0630 GMT.  Sales of Kobe Steel’s aluminium and copper division fell 6.4 percent year on year to 323.3 billion yen ($2.87 billion) in the financial year ending March 2017, with recurring profit falling 20.5 percent to 12 billion yen.', 'The company, based in Kobe in western Japan, has been expanding its aluminium as carmakers increasingly use the material, which is lighter than steel, to meet tighter environmental rules.  Makoto Kikuchi, CEO of Myojo Asset Management, said the raft of recent corporate scandals that has rocked Japan will further damage investor confidence.  “Looking back over several years, foreign investors have bought Japanese stocks on expectations for Abenomics, but among the “three arrows,” the growth strategy isn’t functioning,” he said.  “While they say they’re strengthening corporate governance, improprieties focused on manufacturing have been popping up. Going forward, this will be a body blow to Japanese shares.”']",-1
