Netherlands-based EVBox’s deal with the SPAC is expected to close late in the first quarter of this year.', 'Shares of TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp. closed down a little over 7% on Monday to around $24 apiece.', 'The other two companies Cramer analyzed on “Mad Money” were ChargePoint, which is set to merge with a SPAC called Switchback Energy Acquisition Corp., and EVgo, which recently announced its plans to merge with a SPAC called Climate Change Crisis Real Impact.', '“If you want a charging station play, EVBox seems like the best of the bunch — very similar to ChargePoint but with a faster growth and a cheaper stock,” Cramer said Monday. “Remember, you need to buy the SPAC, TPG Beneficial Finance, and I think you can start building a position right here at $24.”', 'Both EVBox and California-based ChargePoint sell hardware and offer a software-as-a-service component, Cramer said, helping other entities build charging stations at their parking spaces. One of the biggest differences between the companies is that EVBox started in Europe, where it’s the market leader, before expanding in the U.S., Cramer said.', '“This is one industry where European exposure might be very attractive ... because their governments have been much more aggressive about pushing alternative energy,” said Cramer, who has previously pointed to electric vehicles as one of the biggest investing themes now that Democratic President Joe Biden is in the White House.', 'For the current year, ChargePoint projects revenue growth of about 50% compared with 2020 figures, while EVBox is forecasting sales to increase by about 72%, according to Cramer.', 'Cramer said Los Angeles-based EVgo is “higher risk, higher reward” for investors because it’s earlier in its life cycle than EVBox and ChargePoint. EVgo owns and operates the largest network of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles in the U.S., Cramer said.', '“Of course, the largest public fast-charging network still isn’t very large — we’re talking less than 900 locations in 67 metro areas across 34 states — but EVgo’s got some great partnerships,” such as with General Motors, Cramer said.', 'Shares of EVgo’s SPAC partner, Climate Change Crisis Real Impact, closed Monday’s session at $19.67 apiece. Cramer said he wasn’t totally opposed to investors buying the stock before its reverse merger with EVgo is complete.', 'For investors who “want something more speculative, you’ve got my blessing to pick at EVGo on weakness — that’s Climate Change Crisis Real Impact — though ideally you should let it come in a bit more,” Cramer said.']",3

The outsized success of the first two, as well as novice investors entering the market in record numbers, has led some investors to claim this is an indication of froth.', 'And one name symbolizes all three themes: Nikola Corporation.', 'The stock’s well-charted rise, and subsequent fall amid accusations from a short-selling firm that led to the founder and executive chairman’s resignation on Monday, begs the question over whether skeptics are right and that these three ares do indicate an overheated stock market.', 'The battery-electric and hydrogen-powered truck maker has attracted much fanfare since going public on June 4 through a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ. The apparent success of Nikola’s debut — as evidenced by investors rushing into the stock and bidding shares higher — kicked off a wave of announcements from electric vehicle start-ups that they, too, planned to go public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies.', 'A few days after Nikola began trading shares soared to an all-time high of $93.99, for a gain of more than 170%. At one point Nikola had a market capitalization above Ford’s, despite the fact that the electric vehicle maker said it would not generate revenue until 2021. The stock topped the charts on Robinhood, the trading app popular with millennial retail investors.', 'The company’s verbose founder and one-time executive chairman Trevor Milton frequently took to Twitter to tout both the company’s progress and promises. And there has been notable progress towards the company’s vision of transitioning away from fossil fuels: in August Nikola announced that it will provide at least 2,500 all-electric refuse trucks for Republic Services, and earlier in September GM said it was taking an 11% stake in the company, which some on the Street said validated Nikola’s business model.', 'But things began to unravel on Sept. 10 when short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a report accusing the company of making false statements about its technology. The findings have, in short order, reportedly kicked off investigations from the SEC and DOJ, and led to Milton announcing on Monday that he would voluntarily step aside from the company.', 'Shares of Nikola plunged more than 22% during early trading on Monday, and traded around $26.40, a price not seen since May before the merger was complete.', 'Nikola pushed back on Hindenburg’s claims and the SEC routinely looks into companies, meaning an investigation is not necessarily a sign of wrong doing. Amid the turmoil JPMorgan reiterated its buy rating on the stock on Monday saying Nikola’s new chairman, Stephen Girsky, who is a former vice chairman of General Motors and a member of Nikola’s board, may be a “better fit for [the] execution phase.”', 'But the current rout of Nikola’s shares shines a spotlight on the potential dangers of SPACs and electric vehicle companies, as well as the role of retail investors in the market.', 'Special purpose acquisition companies are on track for a record year amid market enthusiasm for these investment vehicles, which are also known as blank-check companies since investors hand over money without knowing when, or even what for, their capital will be used.', 'A number of high-profile investors are leading the charge, including Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman and Starboard Value’s Jeffrey Smith. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan has also launched a SPAC, as has Oakland A’s executive Billy Beane of “Moneyball” fame.', 'On Friday, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that three SPACs backed by Chamath Palihapitiya are looking to raise $2 billion.

For the company the SPAC is targeting, it’s a way to go public on an often accelerated timeline, and without having to jump through all of the SEC’s regulatory hoops.', 'SPACs have traditionally had a somewhat mixed reputation on the Street since the terms can tilt in favor of the sponsor, and they can also be risky given the unknown end target.', '“While we are certain that some would disagree with us, we also get a bit worried when the issuance of SPACs surge,” Tobias Levkovich, Citi’s chief U.S. equity strategist, said in a recent note. “We fully understand the opportunistic nature of such fund raises, but we get concerned about giving people blank checks on deals that may or may not be done successfully in the future. ...There is a speculative element here (even with strong sponsors and good managers),” he added.', 'With a new SPAC seemingly announced daily, former Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn — who himself has launched a SPAC — told CNBC that not all of them are going to “make it over the finish line.”', 'The attention that Nikola got when it entered the public market, which kicked off a number of other electric vehicle start-ups seeking the same route, has led to calls that there are now simply too many players.', 'Speculation around electric vehicle companies is nothing new, of course. Tesla is perhaps the poster child  — the company and its founder Elon Musk have fervent support on one side, with vocal doubters on the other side. While the stock has experienced some recent weakness, it’s still up more than 400% this year. Wall Street analysts frequently cite the company’s valuation as indication that it trades on emotion rather than fundamentals.', 'Still, on the heels of Tesla’s success this year and Nikola’s attention-attracting public debut, electric vehicle start-ups have rushed to take advantage of enthusiasm in the market. China-based Nio, which is a Tesla competitor, has seen its stock surge more than 380% this year, while shares of EV company Workhorse Group, which focuses on last mile delivery, have skyrocketed more than 900%.', 'To name a few of the coming EV/SPAC deals: Spartan Energy Acquisition and Fisker, DiamondPeak and Lordstown Motors, Canoo and Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV, as well as Tortoise Acquisition Corp. and Hyliion.', 'These companies all have bold visions for what the future of mobility will look like. But it remains to be seen whether they can execute on these promises. Tesla in July posted its fourth straight quarter of profits, but it took the company a decade to reach that milestone. The company’s production and delivery issues in the past demonstrate the difficulties in bringing new vehicles and untested technology to the market.', 'Retail investors were among those to pile into shares of Nikola around the debut, according to data from now defunct Robintrack.', 'The accessibility and ease of trading apps like Robinhood have led many to speculate that wild swings in speculative stocks including Nikola, Kodak, and Virgin Galactic, among others, are fueled by novice retail investors.', 'Nikola’s average volume over the last 10 trading days has come in at 53.2 million shares, though it has only about 361 million shares outstanding.', 'Individual investors have also been said to be behind the trading frenzy that pushed the Nasdaq Composite to a record high mere months after the coronavirus pandemic sent stocks tumbling.', 'Japan’s SoftBank has since been identified as reportedly driving much of the action through hefty bets on stock options, but there’s no question retail investors also played a role in the comeback from the March lows.', 'Trading apps like Robinhood have made the public market more accessible to novice investors, but heavy losses have also been reported on the platform from those who might not understand the intricacies of the market.', 'In June, CNBC’s Jim Cramer warned that Wall Street professionals could take advantage of amateur investors by bidding up shares of companies that were popular at the time on the app.', '“It’s a game.

Speaking to CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe,” CEO Håkan Samuelsson referred to the vehicles as a “bridge technology.” As a company, Volvo Cars has said it wants “around 50%” of the cars it sells to be “pure electric” by the year 2025, with the other half sold as hybrids. On the topic of new energy vehicles needing government incentives to drive sales, Samuelsson said he thought that “long term, we need to have sustainable concepts that can be sold on (their) … own merits.” “But of course, in the first transition years governmental support for electric cars would be very helpful and even more helpful would be support to develop a charging network.” Indeed, “range anxiety” — an idea that electric vehicles are not able to undertake long journeys without losing power — has long been seen as a potential barrier to electric vehicle uptake. Better charging infrastructure is likely key to combating this perception.Bit by bit, changes are taking place when it comes to charging. Last month, McDonald’s U.K. said it was planning to install rapid charging points for electric vehicles at new drive-thru restaurants in the country.', 'The fast food giant is partnering with a firm called InstaVolt, which specializes in the technology. Charging infrastructure will also be introduced to existing drive-thru restaurants where feasible, with the technology rolled out to new drive-thrus “as standard.” Around the world, governments are attempting to incentivize the uptake of electric vehicles. In Norway, which is often cited as a model for low emission cars, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association says that electric vehicles do not have to pay annual road tax, have “access to bus lanes” and are exempt from 25% value added tax on purchases, among other things. According to the association, these incentives are in place “until the end of 2021”, when the government will make revisions to them. Governments are also making efforts to improve charging infrastructure. In January, the U.K. government said it would “double the funding” for “the installation of chargepoints on residential streets” to £10 million ($12.72 million). At the time, the government said the money – which will be for installations in 2021 – “could fund up to another 3,600 chargepoints across the country.” Tuesday also saw Volvo Cars report its financial results for the first half of the year.

He went on to devise devices that could transmit power wirelessly and dreamed of a global network that would supply machines everywhere with power and information.', '“All railroads will be electrified,” he said in a 1926 interview with the magazine “Collier’s.” “But “perhaps the most valuable application of wireless energy will be the propulsion of flying machines, which will carry no fuel.”', 'Tesla was half right. Today’s cellphone networks allow cable-free communication, but a worldwide web of wireless power remains elusive — and likely impossible in the form that he imagined. Nevertheless, companies such as the Massachusetts-based WiTricity and Israeli start-up Electron, as well as academic teams, continue to work toward a world with fewer wires, one that realizes specific aspects of Tesla’s vision.', 'But to go mainstream, wireless charging will need international standards and more flexible implementations. Both are under way. Charging while parking will likely be coming to consumer vehicles in 2022, for instance. More versatile technology exists in the lab too. Standard wireless charging approaches work best between two objects at a fixed distance, but in April a Stanford team announced a system capable of efficiently transferring power to a moving device within arm’s length — technology that could someday help cut power cords at home and on the road.', '“This will attract a lot of interest from industry,” says Younes Ra’di, a researcher at the City University of New York who has demonstrated the same technique independently of the Stanford group. This research “created a new direction in designing wireless power transfer that could help build a new generation of wireless power transfer systems.”', 'Electromagnetic waves carry energy as well as information, so there’s no theoretical reason that telecom companies couldn’t beam power around like they do cat videos and music. But practical challenges abound. Long-range power-transfer experiments typically involve beams of microwaves focused tightly on a receiver — imagine charging a solar panel with a laser pointer — that don’t scale well to millions of devices.', 'Over short distances, however, a different approach makes widespread wireless charging more practical. A magnetic field vibrating at one special frequency can make a nearby magnetic field wobble in response, much as belting out the right pitch can shatter a wineglass.', 'Through this effect, one magnetic coil can drive an electric current in a device attached to a partner coil, as a team of MIT researchers demonstrated in 2007, improving on ideas Tesla pioneered. The group spun off the technology into a start-up company in Watertown, Massachusetts, WiTricity, whose charging coils have since found their way into a laptop and electric vehicles.', 'The technique delivers high amounts of power with cablelike efficiency, but the link between the coils can be delicate. Disturbing the system changes the frequency of the magnetic vibration, breaking the wireless connection for such setups in general. “If you move the transmitter or receiver even a little bit, you lose the effect,” Ra’di says. [A WiTricity spokesperson notes that the company has found alternative ways to compensate for this effect.]', ' “If you move the transmitter or receiver even a little bit, you lose the effect,” Ra’di says.', 'In 2017 and 2018, two groups, one at Stanford University and another headed by Ra’di independently, stumbled upon similar workarounds. Inspired by a theoretical concept from optics, they set up the transmitter and receiver in such a way that the two units functioned together as one entity. When one side moves (changing the ideal vibration frequency), the shift provokes a near-instant reaction from its partner, explains Sid Assawaworrarit, one of the Stanford researchers.', 'This flexibility lets the system exploit physical laws to swiftly and automatically seek the most efficient frequency, no software or manual adjustments required. But it was a power hog. For every watt the groups pumped into the transmitter, only around a tenth of a watt reached the receiver.', 'Now the Stanford group has solved that problem too, according to research published in “Nature Electronics.” A redesigned amplifier has let them transmit 10W (more than enough to charge a phone or tablet) over 2 ft with 92% efficiency. More significantly, they got the same performance at closer distances, as well as when Assawaworrarit swung one of the 2-ft-wide coils back and forth as fast as he could. He says that the system would transmit power even if one coil were zooming by at 200 mph, according to simulations.', 'Ra’di calls such performance “amazing,” especially when compared with more rigid systems that work best at one single distance, or inefficient systems where most of the power is lost. “That’s a really huge step forward,” he says.', 'The transmitter effectively creates a similarly sized bubble of energy that can charge any coil-equipped device in range, and requires little power to maintain. These features lend themselves to a range of potential applications, from electrified highways to factories where mobile robots never need to stop and charge. Ra’di, for his part, imagines walking in the door at the end of the day and flopping onto the couch to charge his phone, rather than dashing to the wall to plug it in.', 'And the system could handle much more power using off-the-shelf parts, according to Assawaworrarit. A bigger challenge to scaling up would be the hassle of installing large enough coils. Filling a room with wireless energy, for instance, would require covering most of the floor.', 'Moreover, the road from the lab bench to the real world is long and winding, as Alex Gruzen, WiTricity’s CEO knows all too well. He calls the adaptive charging approach “elegant” and applauds the groups’ work as moving in a “great direction,” but suggests that simpler solutions are already nearing commercialization — especially for electric cars. ', 'Electric vehicles are becoming a major market, and keeping them charged will require installing tens of millions of charging stations collectively, worth nearly $50 billion by 2030 (up from about $5 billion today), according to a McKinsey & Co. report. Wireless parking places, if they work well with a variety of vehicles, are primed to be part of the gold rush. WiTricity’s charging coils, which China chose for its national wireless standard in May, can reach parked electric sports cars and SUVs alike with clearance ranging from 4 in.–10 in., Gruzen says, without significantly adjusting their frequency. ', 'Charging vehicles in motion is on the table with existing technology too, since the distance between a car’s carriage and the road stays fairly constant. Fellow wireless charging company Qualcomm Halo, which WiTricity acquired last year, has built a 300-ft test track in France that can charge cars driving at highway speeds. And Israeli start-up Electreon is electrifying short stretches of road in Israel and Sweden.', 'Magnetic coils could allow wireless charging stations at home eventually, Gruzen agrees. But for now he’s focused on rallying automakers around a single wireless standard that will allow for the proliferation of parking spots and road lanes that energize the vehicles above them. ', 'Toyota licensed WiTricity technology back in 2011, and BMW launched one wireless charging option in Germany in 2018 for about $3,500 (a limited pilot program reached California last summer). Gruzen says other major automakers have committed to launching models with WiTricity technology in 2022. Tesla (the automaker) appears to have other plans, with a robotic “snake” plug in development since 2015. ', 'If automakers can settle on one standard technology, omnipresent, automatic charging stations would let electric vehicles go farther on smaller batteries, reminiscent of Tesla’s imagined fuel-free planes. Hands-free charging also will grow more essential if cars get more autonomous, since they won’t be able to plug themselves in.', '“It’s just all about accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles, Gruzen says, “making them work in more and more places.”', 'For the researchers developing the new adaptive technique, the technologies are complimentary: More resilient connections are just one more tool for expanding the situations where wireless power becomes feasible. Self-tuning systems could also charge multiple moving devices at once, Ra’di says, such as different phones in different pockets. ', 'The current wireless charging market, which is limited to pads that create small charging surfaces, is expected to grow by 30% per year, reaching $27 billion by 2025. Whether future consumers would install additional infrastructure in return for larger charging areas remains to be seen.  ', 'Eventually, Ra’di imagines, power will fill the home alongside Wi-Fi — Tesla’s 1926 vision of the world writ small. “In the future, research will go toward the direction of a small box in the corner,” he says. “You don’t have to stay a certain distance away; you just walk around and it will charge your phone.”', 'Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Toyota licensed WiTricity’s technology in 2011.']",-1

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity.', 'CNBC’s Bob Pisani: Why exactly are ETFs more tax efficient?', 'Nadig: It’s really pretty simple. When you think about it, you’re running a portfolio. You’re buying and selling stocks. That’s what you do. Or bonds, in this case. And in an ETF, when you acquire new securities, you don’t go buy them. You generally get them in a creation unit. The same thing happens when you get rid of securities. They go out in a redemption. And when you do that, you’re constantly resetting the basis of the fund. That means when they come to the end of the year, they haven’t realized any capital gains inside the fund that they have to pass out. Because of that, the vast majority of ETFs never make a capital gains distribution, particularly if they’re index-based. So, the gains that you’re going to have to pay are the ones when you decide to sell, which is just generally more fair. There’s no avoidance here; they’re simply deferring the tax event to when you as the investor make the decision. That’s why ETFs continue to have this tax advantage.', 'Pisani: Are there any other places you need to be careful? Certain things are collectibles, right? Gold, for example.', 'Nadig: Yep. None of that’s changed. ETFs are generally taxed by the IRS based on what they own, so, if your fund just owns gold, you’re going to get taxed as if you just bought bullion, and that means no matter how long you hold it, you’re going to pay a 28% tax on that gain. It’s not short term, it’s not long term, it’s just the collectibles tax. The only other real place is some of the commodities funds that just own futures. That can be a little bit trickier at the end of the year. Some of those funds put out a K-1 that you’ll get a partnership statement and you’ll pay a blended 60-40 rate. If you’re getting into those kinds of funds, you probably need to be having somebody look at your taxes anyway.', 'Pisani: Same with [master-limited partnership] ETFs, right?', 'Nadig: Yeah, MLPs have their own special treatment where they do return of capital, which can be really great for your taxes. You don’t even have to report that. It just resets your basis. But again, when you’re starting to get into slightly more tax-complicated vehicles like MLPs, like commodities, it’s probably a good time to get some advice. I will point out, though, that the ETF structure’s still the most effective way to own those kinds of investments.', 'Pisani: And what if you own your ETF in an IRA or a 401(k) or a SEP plan – tax-deferred accounts?', 'Nadig: Yeah, I mean, you certainly can. You’d lose that tax advantage because you simply don’t care. So, what I tend to tell people is if you’re going to do some sort of trading activity where you’re going to generate names on your own or if you’re going to own something like, say, an actively managed mutual fund that trades all the time that’s going to throw off capital gains, do that in your 401(k), do that in your IRA rollover.
