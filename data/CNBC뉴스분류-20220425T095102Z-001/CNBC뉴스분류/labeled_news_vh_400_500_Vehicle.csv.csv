Self-driving cars represent the next development, and could well be the most disruptive innovation the sector has ever seen. As wild as it sounds, in the near future it could be possible to hail a vertical take-off, flying taxi. Technicians and engineers at German auto giant BMW have been working on driver assistance systems since the 1990s. Five “levels” of autonomous driving have been defined. At Level 1, BMW has said that “driver assistance systems” would support a driver but not assume control of the vehicle. At the other end of the scale, Level 5, full automation would be achieved with the driver becoming nothing more than a passenger.  According to Fred Jones, head of cities in the U.K. and Ireland at Uber, the ride-sharing company wants to be at the heart of the transition to autonomous driving. “We made a decision… do we want to be part of that change and shape the introduction of that technology, or do we want to have that change kind of thrust upon us?”  Uber has already embraced the technology. “We really wanted to be part of that evolution, and so now if you’re in Phoenix, you can push a button and get a self-driving Uber to come and pick you up,” Jones said. He added that, currently, such vehicles still had an engineer behind the wheel to keep an eye on things. Autonomous trucking was another avenue being investigated, Jones said.

The excitement is partly due to the investment — space —unconventional but exciting, but also due to the fact that Social Capital may be one of the more successful SPAC investments, a previously boring  area that has become, along with IPOs, a hot investment vehicle.', 'Hard to believe, but SPACs barely existed until two years ago. Short for Special Purpose Acquisition Company, they are blank-check companies that are formed for the purpose of merging or acquiring other companies. They are usually formed by veterans in key industries, or by well-known deal makers. The pitch is fairly simple: “I am a famous person in the (oil business, tech business, deal-making business etc.) and I want to buy something. Trust me.”', 'That’s what Chamath Palihapitiya did back in September 2017. Here was the pitch to investors: “We intend to focus our search for a target business operating in the technology industries.”', 'That was it.', 'The deal-maker typically prices the SPAC at $10, and usually has two years to make an acquisition. That’s what Social Capital did: priced 60 million shares at $10 in September, 2017. That’s a cool $600 million, but Palihapitiya did not announce what he was investing in until today.', 'That’s a long time to wait for an investment, but regardless: SPACs — along with IPOs — are suddenly hot investment vehicles. 28 SPACs have gone public this year, raising $6.1 billion, which at this pace will easily surpass 2018′s record of 46 SPACs, according to Renaissance Capital.', 'Why are SPACs suddenly so popular? It helps to have a hot stock market, and a hot IPO market, but there’s also growing interest in hiring professional expertise to make purchases on behalf of investors.', '“What you’re buying is a management team with a lot of experience, which is very attractive to investors,” Carolyn Saacke, chief operating officer for capital markets at the NYSE, told me back in 2017, when the first SPACs launched on the NYSE. “They usually have a lot of M&A experience in the companies and the industries they are coming from, so there’s some faith they will be able to buy a company at a decent price.”', 'Another help for SPAC investors: There’s an “out clause.” The proceeds from the IPO are initially held in a trust account that can only be accessed to make the acquisitions. Once the acquisitions are made, the public stockholders can elect to have their shares redeemed for cash if they don’t want to stay in the deal.', 'Do SPACs make money for investors? It’s not a simple question, since the companies can do nothing for more than a year before it makes any acquisitions.', 'But Matt Kennedy, who analyzes IPOs and SPACs at Renaissance Capital, notes that the overall record is spotty: “On average, they don’t do that well, but there have been exceptions.”', 'He notes that since 2017, there have been 108 SPACs. The average return has been a measly 2%, but that includes companies that have not made acquisitions.', 'Of the 22 that have made acquisitions, the average return has been a decline of 13.5%.', 'One of the reasons for the underperformance is what Kennedy calls a “finder’s fee” that enables the founders to buy into the SPAC, essentially for nothing. In the case of Social Capital, initial shareholders got 20 percent of the company at an insider price of $0.002 cent. That’s not a typo: $0.002 cent. The public shareholders got the other 80 percent of the company for $10 a share.', 'That is serious dilution.', 'Kennedy also notes that in most cases investors are also given warrants that enable them to buy more shares at an agreed-upon price after the deal has been completed. They can also sell those warrants, which may provide additional value.', 'Despite the spotty record, as long as the market holds up, plenty more SPACs are coming. There’s two this week alone, including Pivotal Investment Corp II, which is planning to raise 20 million shares at $10 at the NYSE on Friday. It’s run by Jonathan Ledecky, co-owner of the New York Islanders and a well-known investor in his own right.', 'What is he buying?

72,2016-12-13T16:32:04+0000,"['  The United States Department of Transportation announced today  that it is proposing a rule to require vehicle-to-vehicle  communication technology in new cars.', '  Vehicle-to-vehicle systems, or V2V, allows cars to communicate to  each other in an effort to warn drivers about potential accidents  and prevent crashes. The basic technology uses dedicated  short-range radios to allow for the cars to communicate, and can  send data such as location, speed, direction, and braking status.  The DOT claims that the radio technology will have a range of  about 300 meters, and offer a farther range than radar or camera  sensors, in addition to not being as impaired by obstacles or  other vehicles.', '  The DOT hopes that the technology would be used to warn drivers  of oncoming dangers, particularly while turning at intersections  or changing lanes. Additionally, the department notes that cars  with automated driving system (or even fully self driving cars)  would greatly benefit from the addition of V2V data in preventing  or minimizing the dangers of accidents. The V2V announcement  comes on the heels of the recently published DOT guidelines for self-driving  cars from earlier this year.', '  More from The Verge: Google is no longer developing its own self-driving car:  reportThis Audi knows when the light’s going to changeElon Musk will attend Trump’s meeting with tech leaders', '  According to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, “Once  deployed, V2V will provide 360-degree situational awareness on  the road and will help us enhance vehicle safety.” The NHTSA  estimates that the added safety benefits from V2V and V2I  (vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, which the  DOT plans to announce information on in the near future) could  reduce or eliminate up to 80 percent of non-impaired crashes.', '  The technology also considers personal privacy, with the DOT  claiming that no personal information about the driver or vehicle  will be broadcast using V2V, only generic safety information. The  NHTSA is also working to make sure the system is safe from a  cybersecurity standpoint to ensure the data sent is protected  from any digital attacks.', ' Currently the new rule is only a Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking, a notification that the Department of Transportation  has publicly announced that it intends to make the V2V system  required on all new light-vehicles, and is now open to a comment  period of 90 days. After that point, the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration will then review and adjust the proposal as  needed before instituting a final ruling on the requirement. V2V  communication is a major deal in the future of road safety,  particularly for self-driving cars, and today’s announcement is  yet another example of the current DOT leadership trying to pass  a few more policies (such as the recent  announcement for electric cars to make audible noise) before  the upcoming change of administration when President-elect Donald  Trump takes office in January.']",104

The regulation was aimed at reducing air pollution.', '“Policy makers should not try to be engineers,” Palmer quipped, adding that the announcement was “just spin” without any practical meaning.', '“In my view as an engineer, it’s better to prescribe the emission, and then let the engineers figure out what the right technology is,” he said.', 'According to Palmer, the danger in the car ban lies in authorities’ lack of knowledge about which engineering solutions best suit their objectives. By refining existing technology, gasoline cars can almost double their fuel economy — a feat that is already a reality with Formula 1 speeders, which put 50 percent of the energy produced into moving the car, the CEO said.', 'That improvement, if applied to internal-combustion-engine passenger vehicles, would mean an almost 50 percent cut in carbon emissions for a given mileage.', 'In contrast, “if you take today’s engine and you simply slap a hybrid on, you end up more or less in the same place,” he said.', 'Palmer added that policymakers were also muddled about the problem they are trying to mitigate in the first place.', '“Are we trying to solve clean air? In this case, ban diesels. Or are we trying to solve CO2? In this case, you need to use less fossil fuel,” he said. “The two are different. And a lot of the dialogue right now is mixing those messages.”', 'Cars that run on fuel produce carbon dioxide along with other greenhouse gases. Diesel vehicles, however, emit more pollutants, such as soot and nitrogen oxides, as compared with their gasoline counterparts. Those emissions can cause lung and other bodily irritations and may also induce cancer, according to the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists, an independent science and advocacy organization.', 'Palmer added that the impending ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars still wouldn’t make it possible for the auto market to become fully electric by 2040, as he didn’t think batteries would be sufficient to power heavy vehicles.', 'Instead, it’s more likely that “about half the cars will be gasoline and gasoline hybrid, and about half the cars will be alternative fuel,” he said.', 'To be sure,  electric vehicle maker Tesla announced earlier this month that it planned to launch in October a semi truck, which Reuters reported would have a range of around 200-300 miles, compared with an around 1,000-mile range for conventional models.', 'Aston Martin will continue to heavily feature its iconic gasoline V12 engine in its lineup, according to Palmer. ', 'However, he said the company also plans to produce purely electric and gasoline hybrid cars to move toward the zero-emission target, which U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives had pledged to achieve by 2050. ', 'The company has seen a turnaround since Palmer took the reins in 2014, and earlier this year registered its first half-yearly profit in a decade. Its earnings were boosted in part by the launch of its new DB11 model, and the firm plans to release a new model every year.
