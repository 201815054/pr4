With other parts of the world already in turmoil, fallout from Syria could upend the dynamic,  as the peak summer season for oil demand approaches, keeping oil prices in a new, elevated range.', '“Syria is a client state of Russia and Iran,” said John Kilduff, energy analyst at Again Capital.

There was a security cushion, and that’s gone,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “A lot of things are happening at the same time.” ', 'Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 7.8 percent in the past week and was trading near $73 a barrel in the futures market for the first time since December 2014. “It’s probably in an orbit around $70,” said Yergin, adding the floor could be high $60s to low $70s for Brent.', 'Prices jumped this week after Trump said the U.S. would respond militarily to Syria’s use of chemical weapons on its citizens last Saturday, killing dozens and wounding hundreds more. That sparked a blunt response from Russia, which warned the U.S. against the strike.', 'While industry analysts aren’t calling for sharply higher prices, they say the market is vulnerable to more erratic pricing because global supply has drained dramatically over the last year as demand has grown.

Even so, Yemen is viewed as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia that easily could heat up.', '“When you see an escalation in Syria, it raises the risk of escalation in other places. Whether it’s Yemen, whether it’s eastern Saudi Arabia, or Iran or Iraq, it can foment tensions all across the Middle East,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays.', '“If the fundamental backdrop is strong, these things are going to matter. If the fundamental backdrop is weak, it’s not going to matter,” he added.', 'But there are already other factors that could be wild cards for oil supply, affecting oil’s price.', 'One is the Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. may choose to exit in May. Newly named national security advisor John Bolton is expected to encourage the president to abandon the deal, which would mean a return to U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil production and its financial sector.', 'Another uncertainty is Venezuela, where the state oil company PDVSA has seen its production cut in half as its economy teeters and its ability to pump and process crude deteriorates. The U.S. could sanction its already distressed oil sector if President Nicolas Maduro proceeds with an election in May.', 'Helima Croft, the head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said it is “realistic” to start thinking about Brent nearing the $80 a barrel mark. “To move beyond that we’d have to see Venezuela really drop fast. Iran would have real problems, and Yemen would have to visibly look a lot worse,” she said.', 'This is the first significant political premium to show up in crude prices since OPEC and Russia joined forces in late 2016 to steady a market faced with a serious global glut.', 'As oil prices were in free fall then, Saudi Arabia and Russia led other oil-producing nations to agree to curb production by 1.8 million barrels a day. At the time, oil supplies for OECD nations had surged to near 400 million barrels above their five-year average, and were still running at about 300 million barrels above the average at the end of 2016.

The decline was mainly from lower output from Angola, Venezuela, Algeria and Saudi Arabia.', 'Croft said there’s a strong case to be made for both bulls and bears currently, depending on Middle East tensions and the outcome of trade conflict between the U.S. and China. “Which war is going to win out? The Middle East war or the trade war? If the trade war comes back and dominates the headlines, you could have a broad-based macro sell-off that takes oil down with it.”', 'The other unknown is the U.S. shale production, which has increased as OPEC production decreased. OPEC also said Thursday that the world’s total oil supply rose by 180,000 barrels a day last month, mainly because of non-OPEC producers such as the U.S., Norway and the U.K.', '“Shale is the reason we’re not trading over $100 a barrel, way more than $100 a barrel,” said Francisco Blanch, global head of commodities and derivatives at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Production from shale “has been the incremental barrel for years. Not for the last year or two but for seven years.”', 'Analysts are watching for any changes to come with Bolton as national security advisor and a new secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who is awaiting Senate confirmation.', '“I think the escalation of tensions with Russia is a major factor that could impact oil prices,” said Blanch.

The agreement will be reviewed when OPEC meets in June. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih recently told CNBC that it’s important to keep the agreement going.

He said even if the market is balanced, the producers may not want to “lift our hands from the steering wheel and leave the market without stewardship” because it could quickly become out of balance.

According to research from GEP, a provider of supply chain and procurement software to many Fortune 500 companies, wheat and soybean prices have hit nine-year highs, while corn and other cereal prices are also rising.', 'A look at a commodity as mundane as sunflower oil illustrates just how fractured the supply chain is right now and why consumer packaged goods companies are in a bit of a panic.', 'Ukraine and Russia together account for about 65% of the exports of sunflower oil used in potato chips and lots of other snack foods, says John Piatek, vice president of consulting and head of GEP’s consumer goods and retail practice. “There have already been reports of riots, larceny, and looting in places like Turkey which are big importers of sunflower oil, and prices are already double,” he says.', 'The challenge for many of the giant CPG companies around the world is securing alternate supplies since the production of sunflower, along with wheat and other commodities, is so disrupted. “The farmers who would be in Ukraine planting right now have picked up rifles, so the longer this war goes on the less likely it is that this production will be created in the first place,” Piatek says.', 'This disruption to commodities such as iron, steel, nickel, and palladium, is having a similar effect in other industries. Russia accounts for about 20% of global exports of iron and steel. The supply of copper, a key component in EV battery manufacturing, is also being disrupted, forcing companies to look at Chile and Australian as alternatives to Russia.', 'As a result of these sudden stops to the flow of so many essential goods, companies need better visibility into their supply chains.', '“We’re hearing a more pragmatic ask for help,” says Julian Trent, GEP’s vice president of business development for Europe, of the questions he’s getting from customers. They want to know “how on earth they accelerate their visibility into the impact of all this,” he says. ', 'The problem that both Piatek and Trent point out is that most large companies haven’t made the investments into digital solutions such as AI and machine learning for their supply chains.', '“Too much of existing supply chain activities are manual, old-fashioned, and prone to error,” Piatek says. “There are more efficient and effective ways to operate and you need automation to underpin this. I think there’s going to be an increase in AI and machine learning investments as a result of the pandemic and the Russian invasion.”', 'The other driver of bigger investments in supply chain technology is the growing set of risk factors that companies are facing. “If you compare the different risk indicators that a business uses today to five years ago, they are completely different,” says Trent. Many companies used to look primarily at financial risk on a global scale, he says.', 'Digital solutions, and AI-driven automation in particular, can give a company a far more complex and meaningful set of risk alerts, including the geopolitical implications that are now having such an oversized impact.', 'Tuning into “geopolitical risks relies on a lot of listening to open data and news sources and very quickly analyzing the sentiment coming out of certain regions of the world,” Trent says. This will give businesses better scenario and contingency planning abilities instead of the “war room” type planning that’s taking place now.']",-1

The report’s author, Mark Lewis, told CNBC’s Squawk Box Europe Friday that such a view reflected how the economics of renewables were changing “very dramatically” and the way in which electric vehicles were becoming more competitive.', '“We have to be very clear here,” Lewis, who is global head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management, added.', '“What we’re saying is if you’re comparing investing money in renewable energy in tandem with electric vehicles, you can get six to seven times the energy yield at the wheels – useful energy, mobility – for the same capital outlay as you can spending on oil at the current market price of $60 a barrel, and then refining it into gasoline and using it in an internal combustion engine, which loses 80% of the energy as heat.” ', 'On Friday morning, WTI was trading at around $56.20 a barrel, while Brent was priced at around $61 a barrel.Lewis qualified his statement by noting that storage would have to be “in play” on a much grander scale. “That’s why we say this is over the long term, but that’s really where the economics are taking you.” According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), “electric mobility is expanding at a rapid pace.” The IEA says that 2018 saw the planet’s electric car fleet exceed 5.1 million, an increase of 2 million compared to 2017. While the number of electric cars may be increasing, there are undoubted challenges when it comes to charging infrastructure and energy storage for renewables. Sources such as solar and wind  do not promise a constant and predictable stream of power in the way that fossil fuels do. Challenged on the lack of progress with regards to energy storage, Lewis took a historical view.', '“What we have to do is compare a very well established, well capitalized industry like the oil industry, with deep political roots, with what’s happened in the European utility industry over the last 10 years,” he said. Describing that industry as deeply entrenched and well capitalized, he said that renewables had “completely disrupted it in a manner that nobody foresaw.”', '“What you have here is an energy source that’s got a zero short run marginal cost and the capital costs are plummeting, so now is the time to invest in energy storage,” he added.', '“Ten years ago – even five years ago – putting capital into that didn’t really make sense because renewables themselves were still expensive and still needed subsidies.

U.S. producers are halting drilling projects, and OPEC and its partners began cutting their output last Friday. According to ClipperData, Saudi Arabia’s ship loadings fell to a three-day rolling average this week of 6 million barrels per day, down sharply from 12 million bpd in the prior three-day period.', 'As more than half the states reopened their economies to some degree, U.S. gasoline demand rose in the past week to 6.7 million bpd, from 5.9 million the week earlier, according to government data. That’s still about 3 million bpd below normal. According to the Oil Price Information Service, preliminary data from gasoline retailers shows that drivers have increased their purchases at the pump. They are still buying 37.7% less than normal,  but that’s improved from 50%.', '“I think a lot of people are looking at the numbers and saying gasoline demand is looking a little better, not great, but just a little better. Supply has come down and maybe the inventory surplus won’t be as big because OPEC plus is cutting production in May and June,” said Francisco Blanch, head of commodities and derivatives strategy at Bank of America. “The big question is whether the recovery in gasoline demand we’re starting to see is going to continue.”', '', 'Citigroup analysts also point to the fact that fuel in storage remains high, and even though gasoline supplies shrank by 3.1 million barrels last week, other fuel supplies rose. Distillates, which includes diesel, grew by 9.5 million barrels. Diesel demand is down 20% from a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration.', '“A shift in market sentiment was lifting prices earlier this week, but the physical overhang does not want to go away,” the Citigroup analysts wrote in a note. Crude inventories rose by 4.6 million barrels.', 'Blanch said if the market comes back too fast and prices rise too quickly, U.S. shale producers could ramp up some production, slowing the draining of surplus crude.

The reason we are excited is we are past the worst point. If you think about the moment in the crisis where demand was at the lowest point and supplies were at the highest point, we’re past that,” Blanch said. “But we’re not out of the woods.”', 'Prices are steadier than in late April, and WTI crude futures for June ended lower Wednesday at $23.99 per barrel, after a volatile session. WTI is up 60% in the past week and up 22% in the first three days of this week. It was moving higher again Thursday, up more than 8%.

With drivers beginning to emerge, a concern among analysts is that there could be a resurgence in virus infections, which could dampen the rebound in activity.', 'U.S. oil production also matters. The shale industry’s rapid growth in the past decade put the American oil industry on the top of the world, with production surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia, now numbers two and three.', 'The U.S. industry was pumping at record levels even in March, while global demand weakened, but before the virus shutdowns brought it to a halt. Production has fallen to 11.9 million barrels a day, from its high of 13.1 million barrels a day in March.', '″“You can feel certainly a change in sentiment,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman at IHS Markit.

What’s happening with the shut-ins, they do become significant numbers and give some relief to the market.”', 'Yergin said he expects U.S. oil production could be down by 3 million barrels by year-end, and analysts say the declines in May could be steep, with another million barrels or so coming off line.', 'Blanch does expect the market to stabilize and even come into balance by Labor Day. He forecasts Brent prices, at just under $30 a barrel Wednesday, will average $25 in the second quarter. He expects that to rise to $33 a barrel in the third quarter and $39 in the fourth quarter. For next year, he expects Brent to average $45 per barrel and WTI to average $42 per barrel.', 'Shale “producers don’t come back at $15 or $20, but at $30 they’re going to start getting a little looser with their cuts,”  Blanch said. If Brent were to hit $40 or $45, “OPEC might start coming back.” Brent was above $31 on Thursday.', 'OPEC and its partners, including Russia, agreed to cut production by 9.7 million bpd in a deal that went into effect Friday.', 'Matt Smith, director of commodities research at ClipperData, said Saudi Arabia had been loading more crude at a consistently higher level in April, but this week’s levels are the lowest since March. “Because people are watching these numbers to look for compliance, they’re coming out of the gates in May to signal this oil price war is over, and they’re dialing back,” he said.', 'The market has also been reacting to signs that offshore tankers are unloading cargoes, said Blanch.', 'A group of tankers off the California coast has begun unloading, indicating refineries expect a pickup in demand and will increase production.', 'Last week, the tankers unloaded 1.3 million bpd, the second-highest amount in any week this year,  said Smith.

So, Russia, in other words, carries more weight than it used to. Its influence is being felt alto more than in the past,” Blanch said.', 'Yergin said it appears Russia’s motives could be driven by its desire to hit U.S. shale, which has been a wild card in the world market over the last decade.

Kuwait is considered one of the least interesting of the Mideast regional economies and has done little to attract foreign investment. But that reputation might be set for a change.', 'Kuwait’s stock market is being considered for a bump-up to emerging markets status by major index providers, and that would be a significant reclassification within the world of investors. Index funds tracking emerging markets benchmarks, and active fund assets benchmarked against emerging markets indexes, are far larger in size and popularity than frontier markets portfolios.', 'There are 30 exchange-traded funds tracking EM benchmarks, and the three largest ETFs tracking the MSCI and FTSE emerging markets indexes have roughly $135 billion in assets between them. There are two frontier market ETFs with a total asset base of roughly $600 million. Kuwait is the largest country weight in the MSCI and FTSE frontier markets index, at over 21 percent and 19 percent, respectively.', 'In June, MSCI said it would place the MSCI Kuwait Index under review for a potential reclassification from frontier markets to emerging markets status in 2019. Rival index provider FTSE Russell hasn’t classified Kuwait historically, but starting September of this year, it will be classified as a secondary emerging market — it also has an advanced emerging market group.', 'These moves up to emerging markets status could mean billions of global investing dollars for the first time being tied to Kuwait’s economy as emerging markets investors and funds that track index exposure, or have their performance measured against the EM index, are forced to buy shares of Kuwait stocks. Market history shows that, in the short-term at least, the index-review process can mean momentum for stocks in the market up for reclassification.', 'Here are some recent examples.', 'Argentina and Saudi Arabia went through similar emerging markets index reclassifications that started last year and resulted in official upgrades in June. The Saudi stock market was one of the top-performing equities markets around the globe during that process and has outpaced most of the globe this year as well, though there are multiple reasons — oil prices have been rising strongly, and the economic reforms being promoted by the Saudi Crown Prince have contributed to investor confidence. Argentina shares have suffered recently, but its stocks were strong performers in 2017 — it was the No. 1 country stock market in the world last year.', 'Kuwait has the oldest stock exchange in the Gulf, and several of the companies that trade on it are multinational in scope and would benefit greatly from reclassification, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, Fellow for the Middle East at Rice University’s Baker Institute.', 'Trading volume and price action in Kuwaiti stocks has picked up in 2018. Some of the top Kuwait exchange-listed stocks in frontier markets indexes have been on a strong performance run, including Kuwait Finance House and Mobile Telecommunications, 13 percent and 26 percent, respectively, between June and July. The relatively small size of the market overall, and its limited liquidity, also contributed to big run-ups in stock prices since the June news. But any short-term pop in Kuwaiti stocks based on investors getting ahead of the index moves doesn’t reflect a very large hurdle that will remain for Kuwait’s economy: Its massive public-sector reliance on oil, and its lack of investment in the private sector, has led to a series of large budget deficits.', 'Kuwait’s economy, like much of the Middle East, is heavily reliant on oil exports. It is home to 6 percent of the world’s crude-oil reserves, or more than 100 billion barrels. Kuwait has the highest percentage of GDP tied to oil among OPEC nations. Ninety-two percent of export revenue and 90 percent of the government income is reliant on oil.', 'The private sector is expected to grow between 3.5 percent and 4 percent between 2018 and 2021. But the lack of diversification in its economy makes it hard for corporations to find employees and bridge the wide gap between private (36 percent) and public (74 percent) employees. Kuwaiti nationals are guaranteed public-sector employment as part of the oil wealth distribution, while most private-sector employees are migrant workers.', 'As in the case of Saudi Arabia, the Kuwaiti government has released a broad plan for economic development beyond oil, its Kuwait Visions 2035 plan, which aims to increase foreign direct investment and streamline the process for foreign corporations seeking to operate in the nation.

The costs of licenses have also decreased. Foreign investors also are now able to own 100 percent of the shares of companies they incorporate in Kuwait, and receive exemption from income taxes for up to 10 years. These changes have prompted the private sector to pick up.', 'Sophie Olver-Ellis, a research officer at the Middle East Center of the London School of Economics, said Kuwait’s Vision 2035 is promising and that the private sector is spearheading the transition to a non-oil economy. She said that the public sector assumes as much as 90 percent of development projects and the nation is trying to reduce that role by 30 percent to 40 percent.', 'Kuwait has a unique political impediment compared to other Gulf states as it attempts to diversify. It has an active parliament, the National Assembly, which calls the government to account for economic decision-making and has, in the past, blocked major infrastructure and energy initiatives that would modernize and expand Kuwait’s existing economic base. This political brake on economic reform is not present in other GCC states, Coates Ulrichsen said. He noted that the nation is still recovering from the political paralysis that gripped Kuwait between 2006 and 2012, when there were six elections and more than a dozen Cabinet. That did “great harm” to Kuwait’s international investor image and regaining lost confidence among investors about parliamentary pressures remains an issue.', 'Kuwait’s movement to a more balanced economy could reduce volatility in the market. Dramatic changes in oil prices lead to huge swings in its economy. Even with the recent recovery in oil prices, Kuwait is expecting another budget deficit for the 2018-2019 fiscal year of $21 billion (about 17.5 percent of gross domestic product), its fourth-straight annual deficit. The government has had to finance recent deficits from its $600 billion state reserves and bond offerings.', '“Government spending is tied heavily to oil revenues, so the health of the public sector closely tracks oil price rises and falls,” Coates Ulrichsen said.', 'State revenue of $49.5 billion is below the expected spending level of $71 billion. Many have criticized the government’s failure to diversify, and its decision to increase revenue during its years of deficit by increasing electricity and water charges.', '“It remains to be seen how successful it is going to be because it [diversification] is in the early stages,” said Oliver-Ellis.', 'According to Moody’s, Kuwait has been slower than its regional peers in developing its non-oil and private sector. But Oliver-Ellis said she does not view the country’s economic liberalization plan as being far behind efforts in Saudi Arabia, whose larger population prompted a quicker diversification effort. Kuwait has a population of roughly 4.4 million, while Saudi Arabia’s population over 32 million. But if Kuwait does not diversify, it will not be competitive in the 21st century, she said.']",1

To put the number in context, WTI’s second best month on record was Sept. 1990, when it gained 44.6%.', 'But experts are quick to note that the surge in prices follows the steepest downturn on record, and that oil still has a ways to go before it regains old highs. In other words, WTI at $35 per barrel is hardly something to celebrate.', '“It certainly doesn’t feel like it was oil’s best month ever,” said Regina Mayor, KPMG’s global head of energy. “Low $30s for WTI is clearly better than where we were at the end of April, but it’s not sufficient enough to bring the bulk of production back online,” she added.', 'In April, with billions of people around the world under some sort of lockdown in an effort to slow the spread of Covid-19, demand for oil fell off a cliff, which sent prices plunging. WTI dropped below zero and into negative territory for the first time on record. Part of the move was due to the contract’s imminent expiration, but it also reflected the very real fact that no one wanted to take the physical delivery of crude while demand was expected to remain depressed.', 'Since then, things have started to improve.

Overall inventory rose by 7.928 million barrels, compared with the 1.3 million barrel draw analysts had been expecting, according to FactSet.', 'On the other side of the equation, producers have scaled back output at a record pace as plunging prices made operation uneconomical.

Then, earlier in May, Saudi Arabia said that, beginning June 1, it would voluntarily cut an additional 1 million bpd, on top of its portion of the cuts agreed to by OPEC+.

International benchmark Brent crude gained 4 cents, or 0.11%, to settle at $35.33 per barrel. For the month Brent gained 39.81%, for its best month since 1999.', 'Of course, crude’s record month is partially due to the fact that after falling to such low levels, a smaller price move now accounts for a much larger percentage move. WTI is still 4% below its recent high of $65.65 from January. Additionally, oil contracts roll on a monthly basis, but the roll doesn’t align with the standard calendar meaning that evaluating price on a standard monthly basis — rather than the duration of the month-long contract — can be somewhat arbitrary.

They did so in an effort to support prices, as Covid-19 restrictions worldwide and the subsequent plunge in air travel led to a fuel demand shock.', 'Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has since said it plans to cut output by an extra 1 million barrels per day in February and March to stop inventories from building up.', 'Yergin said both the vaccine rollout and the supply cuts have come together to “carry oil prices out of what I was calling the virus alley and looking to recover in 2021.”', 'Oil prices are currently on pace for their third consecutive week of gains.

It was an American-born innovation that helped turn the U.S. from the world’s biggest importer of oil into, just recently, a net exporter of oil and fuel products.', 'In the last decade, U.S. oil production boomed as producers used hydraulic fracturing and evolving horizontal drilling technology to extract oil from difficult-to-access places and some fields that had previously been considered nearly tapped out. The U.S. is now producing just under 13 million barrels a day and has become the world’s largest oil producer.', 'With their growing success, American drillers were able to find ready debt financing as investors were willing to gamble on the idea that wells could start producing in a fraction of the time it took more conventional drillers. That helped drive an oil glut, and global prices suffered from oversupply. The imbalance is improving, but now there are questions about how fast demand will grow.', 'Investors have lost patience with the industry’s boom-to-bust cycles.

The recent extension of this three-year-old pact has helped steady prices.', 'Unlike many of those producers, the U.S. industry is untethered, with no government deciding production levels, and its only constraints are economic and financial.

West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $60.81 per barrel Tuesday.', '“We’re at the early stages [of the shakeout]. The problem is some of these companies still have a bit of rope to go,” said Ken Monaghan, Amundi Pioneer co-director of high yield. “They don’t have [debt] maturities that are coming up in 2020 and 2021.

The irony is the U.S. is heading for these unimagined levels of production,” said Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “The U.S. industry is the world’s No. 1 oil producer, and it’s a major exporter, but the financial markets are giving them no credit for that anymore.

If they stopped drilling, production would be down by as much as 35% a year later, according to IHS.', '“If you look at the problem with the sector itself, which is the significant depletion of the reserve over a briefer time than used to be the norm, you better have capital and balance sheet structures that better match that probability,” Monaghan said.', 'Some of these issues could be fixed in mergers, which have challenges of their own. “It’s often hard to create a merger when you have two companies or three companies that are in the walking wounded category,” said Monaghan.', '“The issue then becomes the acquisition currency.
