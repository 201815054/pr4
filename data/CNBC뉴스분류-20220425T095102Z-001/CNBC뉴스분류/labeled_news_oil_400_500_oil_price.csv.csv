Early December’s OPEC+ agreement will see 500,000 additional barrels of crude per day (bpd) cut from production, with a further 400,000 bpd in voluntary cuts from Saudi Arabia, bringing the alliance’s total output cut aim to 2.1 million bpd  in an effort to boost oil prices.', 'But compliance issues among member states like Nigeria to war-weary Iraq may make these numbers difficult to achieve, analysts say.', 'Japanese bank MUFG sees “signals that oil markets will be in a small surplus of 0.3m b/d next year” and said in a recent report that “our oil price forecasts ... we maintain at USD59/b and USD55/b for Brent and WTI, respectively, in 2020.”', 'The Institute of International Finance (IIF) in Washington, D.C., doesn’t see any hope for oil prices at the start of the next decade, and believes that the extra half a million barrel cut from OPEC+ “may not be enough to rein in projected oversupply in 2020, since the OPEC+ bloc has already made cuts well beyond the 1.2 mbd target of the previous agreement.”', 'Strong production from the U.S., Canada and Brazil, paired with weak compliance by some OPEC+ countries and lower demand for oil globally “could raise global inventories by 1.1 mbd in 2020,” the IIF wrote in a December brief.', '“Consequently,” the organization said, “we expect a decline in average Brent oil prices to $60 a barrel in 2020, compared with an average of $64 a barrel in 2019.”', 'Still others see reason to lean bullish, with the likes of BofA Global Research and J.P. Morgan calling prices above the 2019 average.', 'BofA admits that “target levels announced (in December by OPEC+) may be harder to meet,” and that the group’s output cut agreement shrinks production quotas for several member countries that weren’t delivering on previous quotas already, “casting doubt over compliance levels in 2020.”', 'But if strong compliance does come out of the agreement, that compliance, “coupled with other positive economic developments, such as a pick-up in global inventory restocking and a small U.S.-China trade deal, could push Brent to our $70 price target ahead of schedule,” BofA wrote in December.', 'J.P. Morgan, meanwhile, updated its Brent forecast to $64.50 per barrel for 2020, up from earlier forecasts of $59 per barrel, and it expects prices to fall to $61.50 in 2021.', 'Saudi Arabia will be watching those OPEC+ compliance levels and market conditions ahead of a March 2020 meeting at which time further steps may be taken. But even the highest forecast for Brent in the low $70s won’t be enough to balance the OPEC kingpin’s budget, whose budget deficit is set to increase to 7% next year.

They opened the floodgates,” said Croft. Saudi Arabia ramped up production to just over 11 million barrels a day in November, just as the Trump administration was about to announce it was exempting India, Japan and South Korea, among others, from full compliance with the Iranian sanctions.', 'McNally said the market believed that the exemptions would not be granted, as they had been during the Obama administration when the United Nations sanctioned Iran’s oil sector.

He went easy and the price collapsed,” McNally said.', 'Croft said she had been concerned that Trump’s comments on high oil prices, made around the midterm elections, could backfire.', '“The way he talked down the price of oil, he was really imperiling the financials of the countries that had been very helpful to him during the summer,” Croft said. “Was that social media fist-pumping going to come back to haunt him? Can he cajole them to do this? I don’t know if he can get them to act against their own economic self-interest. I think the Saudis are pursuing a ‘Saudi first’ policy. You cannot say that the Saudis and Emiratis were not helpful to the Trump administration. He seemingly has a price target that’s substantially lower than theirs.”', 'John Kilduff of Again Capital said the Saudi-Russian alliance reacted too quickly to replace Iranian crude and it could again. “It’s making matters worse. It’s like an amateur trader. They’re getting sucked in at the market bottom and at the top.”', 'Saudi Arabia and Russia may also not be as close in their view on supply as their partnership would suggest. Russian oil companies have opposed the cuts, and Saudi Arabia is shouldering the bulk of them. Eric Lee, energy analyst at Citigroup, said Saudi Arabia envisions itself as a central banker of oil that helps stabilize the oil price.', '“But there are a couple of flaws in that. One is that they’re not a dispassionate central banker that’s independent. They have their own interests. Their interests are that for their government spending, they need oil revenues. They would love oil prices in the $70s and $80s. That’s what it would take to balance their budgets,” he said.', '“The Russians are separating from them as well. They need the Russians more than the Russians need them in many ways, there’s a balance but at least economically, the Saudis need $70 to $80. Russia budgets for $40 and the government is more insulated by the ruble,” Lee said.', 'Analysts said the partnership could ultimately eliminate its production cuts, and there’s an OPEC meeting coming up in April where production will be discussed.', '“You have a couple too many cooks in the kitchen. Even as other people are running around doing their own thing, there’s a couple of dynamics,” Lee said. “How many more rounds do the Saudis try to cut or hold cuts to support prices in the near term. At what point might they see market share is being lost and at what point do they flip again?” Lee said.', '', 'Source: Citigroup', 'Lee said he expects the arrangement between Russia and Saudi Arabia to hold together. Sources, familiar with OPEC, said Russia and Saudi Arabia are working toward formalizing the OPEC-non-OPEC partnership and could talk about it at a meeting this month.', '“There’s a benefit of Putin being extremely engaged as being an oil market kingpin, geopolitically and in the Middle East,” he said. “I’m not talking about a schism. It’s just when it comes to talking about whether to cut, the Russian position is much more reluctant to cut or hold cuts longer. Their industry certainly doesn’t want it, and the Russian government itself doesn’t need it anywhere as much as the Saudis do.”', 'But the U.S. production is also factor impacting prices. At 11.9 million barrels a day, the United States is producing 2 million more barrels a day than it was last year, according to weekly data from the Energy Information Administration.', '“Out to 2023, prices might only need to be $45 to $60 because when you go above that or below that, you have too much shale or too little shale.

', 'Only this time, declining business growth over recent years is being compounded by the double whammy of crushed oil prices and global lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, cases of which have surpassed 8,200 in the United Arab Emirates. ', '“Dubai is the most vulnerable of the economies in the Middle East and North Africa to the economic damage from such (lockdown) measures,” U.K.-based consultancy firm Capital Economics wrote in a report this week. “We think that Dubai’s economy could contract by at least 5-6% this year if these measures last into the summer.” ', 'Lockdown measures in the emirate, which is home to the world’s tallest building and largest mall, have seen all but essential businesses close. This “will cause Dubai’s economy to contract sharply, exacerbating overcapacity in key sectors and making it more difficult for the Emirate’s government-related entities (GREs) to service their large debts,” the firm wrote.  ', 'Dubai’s GREs, one of which — investment company Dubai World — triggered the emirate’s 2009 debt crisis when it couldn’t meet its repayments, have cumulative debts equal to $88.9 billion, or more than 80% of Dubai’s gross domestic product, Capital Economics estimates. The Dubai government’s economy department did not respond to CNBC requests for comment or figures, but official numbers are not readily available. In 2018, the IMF estimated that GRE debt was at $60.3 billion. ', '“This is not the first time markets have fretted about a Dubai default,” Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, told CNBC. “But this time it’s serious, given a health crisis, a transport and tourism crisis, an over-supplied real estate market, and an oil price plunge.” ', 'The coronavirus crisis follows a number of years of declining revenues for some of the emirate’s most important sectors, primarily real estate and hospitality. Residential property prices have fallen 30% from their 2014 peak oversupply and weakening demand, and revenue per available hotel room is down more than 25% since 2015. ', 'Last year Dubai’s economy grew at just 1.94%, its slowest pace since the dark days of its near economic collapse in 2009. The crisis, more than a decade ago, was sparked by a property crunch that forced Dubai to seek a $20 billion dollar bailout from its wealthier and more conservative neighbor, UAE capital Abu Dhabi. ', 'Now, the pandemic is likely forcing the emirate to postpone for a year its flagship Dubai World Expo 2020 —  an event officials believed would draw permanent economic stimulus and investment. Tourism has also evaporated since international travel halted in late March.  ', '“If debt problems do materialise, Dubai’s government is not in a position to step in given its own large debt burden,” wrote Capital Economics. Dubai’s sovereign debt — separate from the GRE debt — amounted to 110% of GDP in 2019, according to the IMF, placing it among the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world.', 'Therefore, the consultancy wrote, “a key factor that will determine how fresh debt problems in Dubai play out is the response from neighbouring Abu Dhabi.” ', 'With the pandemic amplifying the supply-demand imbalance, S&P Global Ratings wrote in a note on Thursday, “We now expect to see international demand for property in UAE to be subdued and the fall in residential prices to be steeper than we had expected, and lingering well into 2021.”', 'Pressures on the industry had already raised some worries over ripple effects on the banking sector — last year Dubai lenders extended loans worth $66 billion to Dubai’s property sector, according to the UAE Banks Federation. And a Fitch Ratings report last September warned that banks “have not fully recovered” from the 2009 crash and “smaller banks are more vulnerable to deterioration in credit conditions due to thinner capital buffers and lower revenue generation.” ', 'A big question determining the emirate’s financial future is the speed and extent to which Abu Dhabi steps in with support. As an emirate, Abu Dhabi’s revenues are also being hit by the crash in oil prices, but one of its top economic officials told CNBC last month that it remains in a strong position financially.', '“Abu Dhabi has the resources, even at these levels of crude oil prices, to continue with its planned progression” of its capital investments for 2020,  Mohammed Ali al-Shorafa, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development, told CNBC in mid-March.', 'Abu Dhabi in March announced a $27 billion emergency stimulus plan to help private sector businesses and banks affected by the pandemic. The assets of the emirate’s sovereign wealth funds constitute nearly $950 billion, Capital Economics wrote, “which could pay off the Dubai’s GRE debts more than thirteen times over.”', '“Authorities in Abu Dhabi may be hesitant about bailing out Dubai again given moral hazard concerns as well as the constraints of the collapse in oil prices,” the firm wrote. ', '“On the other hand, policymakers may feel they need to act quickly and aggressively. Failing to support Dubai would also raise concerns about the economic and political stability of the UAE as a whole.”']",-1

Exports have exceeded 3 million barrels a day, overtaking many OPEC nations. The implications are significant for both the U.S. and the oil market, which has seen huge price swings in just the past six months alone.', '“Within the next two or three years, the U.S. will be a net exporter. By the end of the year, the U.S. will be producing 13 million barrels a day. This growth is a seismic event for the U.S. economy at this scale. U.S. oil production is 2.5 times what it was in 2008,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit.', 'U.S. shale has posed a dilemma for OPEC as it has grown in spurts over the past decade, creating supply imbalances by pumping more when prices rise and cutting back as they drop. To battle the glut created by U.S. drillers, Russia formed an alliance with Saudi Arabia and the rest of the OPEC members, and together they have actively tried to either reduce or add supply to the market. But unlike those producers, U.S. production is driven by companies responding to market forces and that adds to the volatility in the world oil market.', '“It’s really become such a huge story in terms of U.S. production, but also because of our policy. The U.S. is a swing producer but it’s also through policy that we’ve taken 1.6 million barrels off the market,” said Helima Croft, global head of commodities strategy at RBC. “We’ve been really lucky we’ve had the U.S. producers. That’s where the U.S. currently plays a role in helping out the market. Trump talks to the Saudis. Trump sanctions Venezuela. He’s really active in the market. Have we had a U.S. president be this consequential in the oil market, in terms of intervention?”', 'Trump’s policy has added to oil market volatility. When sanctions were announced on Iran last year, the U.S. said there would be no waivers for its customers. That sent oil prices higher. Yet, the U.S. did grant waivers to India and others during the fall, and that sent oil prices reeling. Iran exports are now about 1.1 million barrels a day, down from about 2.5 million in the spring. The waivers granted for those customers are up for review in May, so if they are not extended, more Iranian oil could come off the market.', '“It’s going to be a market with tremendous volatility,” said Carlos Pascual, IHS Markit senior vice president. “In 2018, the price of [Brent] oil went between $50 and $86 a barrel, but the average was $70. For the person looking at it and saying ‘$70, that’s not a big deal,’ depending on when you were buying, what country and what situation, the difference between $50 and $86 could be huge.”', 'About 4,000 representative of the global energy industry gather this week in Houston, where IHS Markit holds its annual CERAWeek conference.

The country’s oil production has been in decline, and some forecasts put the country’s production at just 500,000 barrels per day by the end of this year.', '“We’re looking at a similar kind of [oil] market in 2018. A lot of volatility and an average that keeps us in a similar range of $70 a barrel. In that sense the sanctions on two OPEC members could potentially add to some of the uncertainty and volatility around that market,” Pascual said.', 'The Saudis have now committed to cut back to 9.8 million barrels a day, after sending close to 11 million barrels a day onto the market in the fall. As Saudi Arabia and Russia committed to cut production, oil prices began to rise again.', 'But Trump periodically presses OPEC about high prices in tweets. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude reached a high in the futures market of $57.88 per barrel this month, gaining 37 percent from its Dec. 24 low of $42.36. But that low came after a sharp 45 percent decline from the $76.90 it was at on Oct. 3.', '', '“Trump seems to have picked up a fair amount of influence over OPEC and certainly the oil market has started to fear the Trump effect. Whenever he tweets prices shouldn’t go higher. The fear is the Saudis will follow and deliver, as they have so far. Shale will deliver if the Saudis don’t,” said Francisco Blanch, Bank of America Merrill Lynch head of global commodities and derivatives.', 'In the past week, Chevron and Exxon announced substantial increases in their production in the Permian Basin. Exxon said in a statement its production would be profitable in the Permian even if oil prices fell to $35 per barrel. The breakeven, or point where expenses for drilling a barrel of oil are covered, has fallen over the years for shale oil, and the major oil companies have helped drive it down even further, said John Kilduff of Again Capital.', '“Saudi Arabia and Russia have a problem on their hands,” Kilduff said of the major oil companies’ shale production. “They’re running the risk of attempting to micromanage the price and blowing it on both ends, instead of staying steady. What happened to them in the fall was they got out there thinking there was going to be sanctions, and they ramped up production to respond to that.”', 'That plan backfired. “They got burned. Then you had Saudis go overboard and cut way back on exports to the U.S. and try to balance the market as rapidly as they could. Now they stand the chance of the price going higher than they want, which will only get more U.S. shale installed and produced,” Kilduff said.', 'The sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have removed some of the heavier crude from the market that is used by U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The result is higher price differentials but Pascual said that could be temporary because of a new fuel requirement for the shipping industry, which uses a high sulfur sludge-like fuel.', '“I think it’s a short-term story. The longer-term story is that after the IMO regulations come into place in January, which restricts the level of fuel that can be used in ships, then there’s going to be a drop in demand for heavy crude. It’s really a short term issue,” Pascual said.', 'Blanch said ultimately the oil market could become more like natural gas, a market with plenty of supply and less volatile prices than oil.', '“I think over time volatility declines, and prices sit at the marginal cost of production,” he said. “The industry is going to have to decide if every marginal player has the right to exist, and some of those guys get rooted out. Consolidation is another likely trend. ...That’s what’s going to happen in the next few years, and in the process you get ups and downs. You get Venezuelas and Irans.”']",-1

The additional boost to demand from looser monetary policy is therefore likely to fuel inflation,” it added.', '“The longer-term concern is that the RBI’s independence is being eroded,” the research firm warned, saying that. “Any perception that policy is being kept loose for the benefit of the government could reverse the success the central bank has had in reining in price pressures over the past five years, and lead to a permanent rise in both inflation expectations and actual inflation over the medium term.”', 'India has managed to bring down its price pressures rather significantly in the last few years.

Indeed, growth is slowing. But not to the extent of warranting an aggressive move,” said ING’s Sakpal.', 'There’s “nothing the RBI policy can do” about supply-side influences on inflation, such as monsoon season and oil prices driving food and fuel prices, he said. Rather, the central bank should use higher rates to adjust future consumer demand for food and fuel.', '“Monetary policy is more effective in influencing the demand and it could have been proactively guided toward pre-empting future demand-pull price pressure. Not fueling it by cutting the interest rates,” Sakpal said.', 'Biswas of IHS Markit, however, said inflation numbers are currently still well within the central bank’s target range.

Meanwhile, the  energy sector is down roughly 15 percent over the same period.', 'Analysts and portfolio managers say it makes sense that energy stocks fell less than oil prices over the last eight weeks. Since the sector didn’t run up as much as crude futures during September’s oil market rally, energy stocks weren’t poised for such a precipitous fall.', '', 'But the wild swings in the oil market over the last few months explain in part why the moves in energy stocks are less pronounced: The oil price volatility has encouraged stock investors to play wait and see.', '“If you don’t have conviction on the commodity prices, which nobody does right now ... it’s harder to make the case that now’s the time to buy energy, versus perhaps another sector,” said Tamar Essner, director of energy and utilities at Nasdaq Corporate Solutions.', 'Energy portfolio managers also say the flood of money into the technology sector throughout much of this year meant investors largely overlooked energy stocks even though they were clearly undervalued.', 'Energy did briefly outperform other sectors from early September through early October, when oil prices spiked ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy industry. But the slide in oil prices is once again keeping investors on the sidelines.', 'To be sure, the energy sector seldom rises and falls in lockstep with oil prices. That’s largely because not all stocks in the space are directly linked to the cost of crude. Energy giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron have refining businesses that benefit from low oil prices, and profits at infrastructure companies mostly depend on the volumes flowing through their pipelines.', 'But even independent drillers focused on producing and selling oil typically have insurance against falling prices, said Essner. Many drillers take out hedges, a strategy that essentially locks in a price for oil shipments well ahead of delivery to customers.', 'Stock investors are also primarily focused on a company’s future earnings and growth, Essner noted. Since the worst of the oil price declines are concentrated in contracts for delivery in the next few months, investors aren’t necessarily panicking about a prolonged oil price slump.', 'The oil price-energy stock mismatch can also be explained by one-off anomalies, according to Jay Hatfield, CEO and portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Management.', 'Oil prices plunged nearly 8 percent to $50 a barrel on Friday, which happened to be the lowest volume day of the year in U.S. stock markets due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Since there weren’t many stock traders at their desks, the oil price plunge didn’t have an outsize impact on energy equities.', '“The commodity market can get out of whack in low-volume times, and stocks aren’t necessarily going to follow, because it’s completely irrational,” Hatfield said.', 'That jibes with the growing consensus that supply and demand fundamentals only account for the first leg of the oil price downturn. A growing chorus says much of the pullback is due to trading strategies that exacerbate selling, rotation out of sagging crude futures and into surging natural gas contracts, and the steady unwinding of bullish oil bets placed earlier this year.', 'The brisk pace of mergers and acquisitions shows that strategic buyers recognize the value in the sector, according to Hatfield. That could be a signal for investors to buy into the energy sector, he said, particularly as oil looks like it’s bottoming out and traders have been chastened by the recent pullback in tech stocks.', '“It’s helping that people realize it’s not risk-free to buy Amazon at $2,000 per share,” Hatfield said.', 'Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, believes energy stocks are thoroughly undervalued.

Until recently, many drillers reinvested virtually every dime earned into hiking oil production. Thummel said investors haven’t yet seen the fruits of the industry’s recent commitment to financial discipline and value creation.', '“We’re probably in the first or second inning of this.

Odds of a 2020 U.S. recession have risen to 34 percent, from 28 percent before this year’s spike in crude oil, Moody’s stated in a report.', 'President Donald Trump’s tax cut, a deal on Capitol Hill to boost government spending, and a flattening of the difference between short- and long-term interest rates also are contributing to the elevated recession risk. “My recession odds for 2020 have significantly increased since late last year,” Zandi said.', 'Oil seesawed in trading on Monday after President Trump’s tweet about Iran added to a geopolitical catalysts for oil. It started trading strong but trailed off by the end of the day. Recent swings in the price of oil — especially early last week, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said some buyers of Iranian oil may be given extra time before sanctions hit, and Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed working together to regulate oil prices — show that the oil trade remains vulnerable to a downturn.', 'Sanctions against Iran, reimposed as Trump repudiated his predecessor’s deal to halt Iran’s development of nuclear weapons, is playing a major role in crude oil prices. In late June the Trump administration signaled that oil buyers must stop buying Iranian crude by November, and shortly after, Trump said he had a deal with the Saudis to increase production, though doubts remain about the Saudis’ ability to increase production by as much as 2 million barrels.', 'In June figures reported last week, Saudi production was up by 500,000 barrels as it tries to tame the recent growth in crude oil prices. But the Saudis also have also said they cannot raise oil production above that level this month.', 'Earlier this month, Sanford C.

On Monday, as the U.S. and Iranian leaders ratched up their war of words, some analysts contended that oil could reach $200 a barrel if Iran shuts down the Strait of Hormuz or takes military action.', 'The case for a short-term surge in crude prices is that the Trump sanctions would remove much, even all, of Iran’s 2.2 million barrels per day from a global market of just less than 100 million daily barrels, at the same time the global economic expansion has demand growing 1.7 percent annually, according to Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Oslo-based consulting firm Rystad Energy.

Assuming no major geopolitical crisis, and that is a big assumption, we expect to see a downward slope even with Iran sanctions.”', 'The reason: U.S. shale output will continue to rise from what is already a record level. “By next year, the U.S. will be the largest producer of oil in the world,” Baumohl said.', 'U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices were around $68 on Monday, while Brent crude oil was near-$73.', 'The issue of more expensive crude and its economic ripple effects boils down to two questions: What would happen if crude really went up above $100, and how likely is that scenario, really?', 'The first question can be answered, at least partly, using some established rules of thumb about how much spending on gasoline cuts into other consumer spending. Baumohl cites an estimate that every penny added to the price of gasoline reduces consumer spending by $1 billion a year. Zandi estimates that every $10 added to crude prices would reduce U.S. growth by 10 to 15 basis points, or 0.1 to 0.15 percentage points, in the year after the increase.', 'Going from $50 to $75, which has already happened, will reduce growth by a quarter of a point to nearly half of 1 percent, Zandi said. If oil hit $150, an economy recently growing near a 3 percent rate would see growth fall by half, and that’s before higher prices sparked inflation and forced interest rates higher, Baumohl said.', '“I think $150 oil in a short period would suck the wind out of the expansion,” Zandi said. “Recession risks would be very high.”', 'Before the 2008 recession, the price of Brent crude, traded in Europe and used in most of the world, rose to about $140 in June of that year, a month before U.S. prices for regular gasoline topped out at an average of $4.11. Today gasoline costs on average about $2.87, according to the Department of Energy.', 'Oil prices also spiked right before the 1990 downturn, running from $15 in May to $40 by September as Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. It then jumped from $10 as the dot-com boom gathered steam in late 1998 to nearly $30 by the time the Nasdaq average peaked in early 2000.', 'The harder question is whether oil really is likely to go anywhere near $150, or whether U.S. suppliers can head off the worst of the damage by increasing domestic production. Another significant factor is whether they can build pipelines fast enough to carry crude from newer “tight oil” fields in Texas — made newly pumpable by hydraulic fracking technology — before prices spike.', 'The conventional wisdom since oil prices collapsed in 2014 has been that U.S. suppliers, who need a higher price to be profitable than many members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, would ramp up production whenever crude topped about $50 a barrel.', 'That has been upset by a shortage of pipelines serving Texas’ Permian Basin, home to much of America’s cheapest-to-produce crude oil, said Paul Tossetti, executive director of short-term crude market forecasting for IHS Markit. Both Tossetti and Rystad’s Tonhaugen said the pipeline issue has nothing to do with delays in building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which will originate in Canada.', 'Texas producers’ inability to get their crude to market efficiently is forcing them to sell it on West Texas-based markets, whose benchmark price is about $15 lower than oil sold in Oklahoma and $18 below the Brent crude price.', '“It’s a $23- to $25-a-barrel difference [on some days], and that is a lot,’’ Tossetti said.', 'The case for $150 oil is based on the fact that major oil companies slowed capital spending devoted to the search for new sources of supply to their lowest point in a generation, mostly outside of the U.S., when crude oil moved as low as $30 in 2016, Bernstein analysts led by Neil Beveridge wrote. Companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron curtailed capital spending to protect their share prices with stock buybacks and dividends, the report said, and that means a shortage of new supply.', 'The Iran sanctions are being honored by many oil giants outside the United States, even from countries that disagree with the Trump administration on the sanctions, Tonhaugen said. The global oil market’s reliance on the dollar as a unit of exchange, and on U.S. banks and reinsurance companies that are bound by U.S. sanctions, means that the Iran sanctions are likely to bite hard when they take full effect in November. “No one yet knows how much supply the world will lose because of Iran, but the last time sanctions were imposed in 2012 it was 1.2 million barrels,” Tonhaugen said.', 'Conventional oil projects take at least 18 months to complete exploration and begin production, but shale fields in Texas and North Dakota can scale up much more quickly, said Chris Lafakis, an energy economist at Moody’s Analytics. But those barrels can’t reach the world market easily, or fetch the price producers want, until new pipeline capacity comes online, and that’s expected to happen late next year.', '“The notion that there would be no supply-side response from U.S. shale to a strong price signal is preposterous,” Lafakis said.', 'Baumohl is bearish on oil prices over the next two years, based on the shale’s growing influence over the market. “Prices will ease down over the next two years. We believe WTI will hover between $40 and $50 a barrel.”', 'Neither Rystad nor IHS Markit is bearish, but they don’t expect oil to get anywhere close to $150 before shale supplies rebalance the market. IHS currently forecasts a $75-a-barrel price target for next year, Tossetti said, though it is subject to a rethink given the fluid situation. Rystad’s base case calls for $80 but doesn’t include any impact from Iran’s disruption.', '“The market is on a thin edge where we could lose more supply than Saudi Arabia [and other swing producers, like Kuwait], are able to increase by in the next six months,” Tonhaugen said. “That leaves oil-price risk skewed to the upside and vulnerable as global spare capacity will be put to the test.”', 'If oil stays under $100, the macroeconomic effects of this year’s price increase will remain small, said Joel Naroff, president of Holland, Pennsylvania-based Naroff Economic Advisors. Disputes within OPEC about production quotas raise the odds that that will happen, he said. So does the chance that rising oil prices will cut into demand from developing nations, as well as the new pipeline capacity next year, he added.', 'Despite the swings over the past week of trading, the fundamental supply-demand backdrop remains more or less unchanged, according to Tonhaugen. The market will lose supply from Iran toward year-end in a gradual fashion in his firm’s base case. Other oil experts agree that Iranian oil exports will not go to zero in November, but they do expect a significant decrease.', 'The risk of further supply disruptions remain as Saudi Arabia must reduce its spare capacity to make up for ongoing and future expected supply losses (Venezuela, Libya, Nigeria and Iran). Negative effects on demand due to U.S.-China trade tariffs is a real risk, but the effect on demand is much lower than the potential uncertainties on the supply side.']",-1

We think that that’s going to be about a zero, but that’s nowhere near what you would get in a typical recession, but a lot of damage. And the assumption there is that this plays out when you get towards year-end and gets under control. So, the damage in terms of profits is a first-half issue. … You can’t look at an illiquid market that’s doing what it’s doing as a signal, and we don’t know, but if you listen to the experts, if you look at what past recessions have meant for earnings, that’s probably about as good a guess in a changing world as you can make.”', 'Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets and chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, recommended investing based on what he called the theme of the decade: deglobalization.', '“You have to look at what are going to be the enduring effects of this? Whether we end up crossing this dividing line and end up getting a vicious cycle or not, what are the enduring effects of this? I think that deglobalization is just going to be the really big theme of this decade. So, you want to sort of be in economies and in markets which are just not going to be that dependent on the rest of the world, and so in that regard, the cheaper places. And we have a new oil order. I think that that is going to last for a while in terms of the fact that the price of oil just keeps sort of settling at lower and lower levels. And so, you want to be more with the oil-importing countries. You want to be in countries with large domestic markets and beneficiaries of deglobalization. Those are the enduring effects. What we have to get through over the next two or three weeks now is hoping that that analysis … is correct, that this follows the China template and it peaks in the next week or so. Because if it goes on for three, four weeks, then my fear about the vicious feedback loop developing with the global bond market and also the fact that the stock market crosses the line of 20%, I think you end up getting something which is much more sinister than what’s been priced in to date.”', 'Disclaimer']",-1

As the world’s biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia realized it could nudge the data in a direction that boosts the cost of crude.', '“It worked so well in 2017 for [the Saudis] to cut flows to the U.S. because people could see the inventories dropping because U.S. data is so timely and transparent,” said Matt Smith, head of commodities research at ClipperData.', '“The markets have become more transparent through tanker tracking,” Smith said. “You can see those changes being implemented more, and [the Saudis are] aware of that.”', 'November’s drop in Saudi barrels bound for the United States follows a six-week oil market rout that saw prices plunge 25 percent into bear market territory. It also comes after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih warned on Monday that OPEC, Russia and several other producers may soon launch a fresh round of price-boosting output cuts.', 'Shortly after Falih issued the warning, Trump took to Twitter to voice his disapproval with that plan.', '@realDonaldTrump Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!', 'But Saudi Arabia may not be swayed by Trump’s pressure campaign. In recent days, Smith and other energy analysts have claimed that Trump essentially duped OPEC and its allies into raising output earlier this year.', 'The analysts say Trump’s threats to impose harsh sanctions on Iran, OPEC’s third-biggest producer, played a part in convincing the producers to stop capping output and start pumping more oil. But Trump ultimately allowed some of Iran’s biggest customers to keep importing its oil, which meant the oil squeeze the alliance feared never materialized.', 'Consequently, the producers put even more oil into a market that is swinging toward oversupply, giving traders another reason to sell off crude futures and push prices lower.', 'While the Saudis are probably not happy about that outcome, Smith says cutting oil shipments to the United States does not appear calibrated to punish Trump. Instead, it’s simply about preventing another oil glut and boosting prices.', 'Cutting production while shrinking shipments to the United States offers “the biggest bang for the buck,” according to Smith.', 'Still, it’s a direct challenge to Trump’s goal of pushing oil prices even lower.', 'On Sunday, Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said the kingdom’s oil shipments would fall by 500,000 barrels per day in December. The following day, he said OPEC and its partners could slash their collective output by 1 million bpd next year.', 'ClipperData figures show the Saudis are loading roughly 600,000 bpd on tankers bound for the United States this month, down from more than 1 million bpd in July and August. If official trade figures end up matching ClipperData’s loading estimates, U.S. imports of Saudi crude are heading toward record lows.', 'Saudi loadings for the U.S. market rebounded through August after the OPEC alliance hiked output. Those shipments generally take six to seven weeks to reach U.S. shores.', '“The last of that has just been hitting the U.S. Gulf in the last few weeks,” Smith said. “But now, as those export loadings have dropped off in September and October, that means there’s going to be a dearth of deliveries as we close out the year.”', 'On Thursday, government data showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose for an eighth consecutive week, jumping by 10.3 million barrels. The drop in Saudi shipments in recent months could soon help to whittle away at those inventory levels.']",100

Rather to keep it a little tight a little too long than to run into an oversupply before Covid-19 vaccines have truly made their magic on global economic activity and oil demand,” Schieldrop said.', '“The upcoming OPEC+ meeting is thus unlikely to ruin the oil party with respect to April supply as the total outcome is likely going to leave the market slightly short rather than in surplus.”', 'International benchmark Brent crude futures traded at $63.01 a barrel on Tuesday morning, almost 1.1% lower, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures stood at $60.02, down more than 1%.', 'Oil prices, having climbed to a 13-month peak last month, appeared to extend losses that began last week on expectations that OPEC+ may be set to increase global supply.', '“Our expectation is that they are going to rise in line with their previous policy deal which was announced in December of 2020.
