But there’s a new version of the EUV machine in the pipeline, dubbed High NA, that could allow chipmakers to build even more sophisticated chips to power the next generation of electronic devices. NA stands for numerical aperture.', 'ASML was born in 1984 when electronics giant Philips and chip-machine manufacturer Advanced Semiconductor Materials International decided to create a new company to develop lithography systems for the growing semiconductor industry. Called ASM Lithography, the company began its work inauspiciously — in a shed next to a Philips office in Eindhoven.', 'Today, ASML is valued at $329 billion, and some tech investors expect it to be worth $500 billion by the end of 2022.

Intricate patterns are created on the wafer where the light comes into contact with the chemicals, which are carefully laid out beforehand. This process, which leads to the formation of the all-important transistors, is known as lithography.', 'Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics, and they enable an electric current to flow around a circuit. Generally speaking, the more transistors you can fit onto a chip, the more powerful and efficient that chip will be.', 'Not every lithography system that ASML makes has EUV capabilities. EUV is the company’s latest technology, which it introduced for high-volume manufacturing a few years ago. DUV (deep ultraviolet) is still the workhorse of the industry.', 'Chris Miller, an assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, told CNBC that chipmakers want to use the narrowest wavelength of light possible in lithography so that they can fit more transistors onto each piece of silicon. The TSMC chips in the latest Apple iPhones, which were created with ASML’s EUV machines, have around 10 billion transistors on them.', 'High NA is set to be even bigger, more expensive and more complicated than ASML’s current EUV machine.', '“It includes a novel optics design and requires significantly faster stages,” an ASML spokesperson told CNBC. They added that the High NA machine has a higher resolution that will enable 1.7x smaller chip features and 2.9x increased chip density.', '“With this platform, customers will reduce the numbers of process steps,” the spokesperson continued. “This will be a strong motivation for them to adopt the technology. The platform will offer significant defect, cost and cycle time reductions.”', 'For context, each of the current EUV machines reportedly has over 100,000 components, and they take 40 freight containers or four jumbo jets to ship. They cost around $140 million each, according to reports.', '“They’re not resting on their laurels,” said Miller, adding that the company’s new machine will allow even more specific etchings on silicon chips.', 'The first High NA machine is still under development and it’s set to be available for early access from 2023 so that chipmakers can start experimenting with it and learn how to make it work.', 'Customers will then be able use them for their own research and development in 2024 and 2025.

He declined to say how many machines Intel has ordered.', 'The new High NA EUV tool shifts from a .33 aperture lens to a sharper .55 aperture to enable higher resolution patterning, Tichelman said.', 'A higher aperture allows for a wider EUV beam inside the machine before it hits the wafer. The wider this beam, the more intense it can be when it hits the wafer, which increases how accurately lines are printed. This in turn enables smaller geometries and much smaller pitches, increasing density.', 'Alan Priestley, a semiconductor analyst at Gartner, told CNBC that ASML’s new machine will allow chip manufacturers to make chips below three nanometers. The most advanced chips in the world are currently three nanometers and above.', 'The High NA machines will cost about $300 million, which is twice as much as the existing EUV machines, and they’ll need complex new lens technology, Priestley added.', 'Chips are often comprised of 100-150 layers on one single silicon wafer. Only the most complicated layers need to be made with EUV machines, while more simple layers can be made with DUV machines, which ASML also makes, and other tools.', 'EUV machines take years to build and ASML can only ship so many of them in any given year. Last year, it sold just 31, according to its financials, and it’s made around only 100 in total.', '“Compared to traditional EUV machines, a High NA machine provides a bigger lens capable of printing smaller patterns, enabling efficient manufacturing of more powerful chips,” said Syed Alam, global semiconductor lead at Accenture.', '“Chipmakers looking to print smaller features onto chips have had to rely on double or triple patterning techniques, which is time-consuming,” he added. “With a High NA EUV machine, they are able to print these features in a single layer, resulting in a faster turnaround time and better process flexibility.”', 'Chipmakers will have to strike a balance between better performance and the greater costs associated with more sophisticated machinery, Alam said.', '“This is particularly true with High NA EUV machines where larger lenses imply higher acquisition and maintenance costs,” he said.', 'Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that a single wafer often comprises of 100-150 layers.']",-1

Quite a lot, theoretically.', 'If China decided to open up a full swap line with Russia, accepting rubles as payment for anything it needed to buy — including crucial imports like technology parts and semiconductors that Moscow has been cut off from in the latest rounds of sanctions — China could essentially plug most of the holes fired into Russia’s economy by the West. ', 'But whether that’s entirely in Beijing’s interest to do so, and how much it could backfire, is another matter.', '“In terms of to what extent China could help Russia, they could help them a ton,” Maximilian Hess, a Central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC. “But they would be risking major secondary sanctions on themselves, major renewed trade and sanctions war with the U.S. and the West as well.”', 'Given the uncertain state of Chinese markets over the last few weeks, amid mounting inflation and a major new Covid-19 outbreak in the country, “it might not be the best time to do that,” Hess said.', 'Still, Beijing does have a long-held alliance with Russia and can benefit from its position. ', 'Before the invasion, Beijing and Moscow announced a “no limits” strategic partnership they said was intended to counter U.S. influence. China’s position has been to ultimately blame the U.S. and NATO’s eastward expansion for the conflict, and on March 7 its foreign minister, Wang, called Russia his country’s “most important strategic partner.”', '“No matter how perilous the international landscape, we will maintain our strategic focus and promote the development of a comprehensive China-Russia partnership in the new era,” Wang said from Beijing. ', 'And while China’s government has expressed “concern” over the conflict in Ukraine, it has refused to call it an invasion or condemn Russia, largely pushing Moscow’s narrative of the war on its state news outlets.', '“China and Putin have a clear interest in working together more closely,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in an early March research note.', '“China is happy to cause problems for the West and would not mind turning Russia gradually into its pliant junior partner.” It could also take advantage of its position to buy Russian oil, gas and other commodities at discounted prices, similar to what it’s been doing with Iran. ', 'To what extent China’s leadership steps in to support Moscow will play a key role in the future of Russia’s economy. China is Russia’s top export market after the European Union; trade between China and Russia reached a record high of $146.9 billion in 2021, up 35.9% year on year, according to China’s customs agency. Russian exports to China were worth $79.3 billion in 2021, with oil and gas accounting for 56% of that. China’s imports from Russia exceeded exports by more than $10 billion last year. ', '“Russia can use China over time as a bigger alternative market for its raw material exports and a conduit to help circumvent Western sanctions,” Schmieding said.', '“But for both countries with their very different perceptions of history, it could be an uneasy and fragile alliance that may not outlast Putin.”', 'The powerful alliance of the G-7 economies, composed of the U.S. and its European and Asian partners, can slap harsh secondary sanctions on any entity that supports Moscow. But the problem here is that China’s economy is the second largest in the world and is a key part of global supply chains. It impacts global markets far more than Russia does. Any move to sanction China would mean much greater global effects, and likely economic pain for the West, too.  ', 'Beijing likely seeks a “third way somewhere between the binary choice of supporting Russia or refusing to do so,” analysts at New York-based research firm Rhodium Group wrote in a note in early March. That middle path involves “quietly maintaining existing channels of economic engagement with Russia … while minimizing the exposure of China’s financial institutions to Western sanctions.” ', 'Indeed, in early March, the chairman of China’s banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, said China opposed “unilateral” sanctions and would continue normal trade relations with the affected parties.', 'But maintaining that kind of economic engagement with Russia will be “hard to conceal under the current sanctions architecture,” Rhodium’s analysts wrote. ', 'Could Beijing keep letting Russia access and trade with its yuan reserves, which total around $90 billion, or about 14% of Russia’s FX reserves? Yes. But what if Beijing allowed Russia’s central bank to sell yuan-denominated assets for dollars or euros? That would likely expose it to sanctions.', 'China can still trade with Russian firms in rubles and yuan through the Russian banks that haven’t yet been sanctioned. But despite many years of working to increase bilateral trade in their own currencies, the vast majority of that trade – including 88% of Russian exports – is still invoiced in dollars or euros. ', 'Not only that, but China could be essentially catching a falling knife by taking on the credit and sanctions risks of Russia’s rapidly deteriorating economy. ', '“China could alleviate the vast majority of the pain,” Hess said. “But if they offered those swap lines and everything, effectively they’d be taking all the liabilities and risks of the Russian economy onto their own balance sheet at a time when the Russian economy is at its weakest in decades.” ', '“So that’s maybe not the wisest move economically,” Hess said. “But politics are different decisions.”', '']",100

The Consumer Tech Association, an American trade group, said that 2020 was the biggest year on record with nearly $442 billion in retail sales revenue, and is projecting big demand for game consoles, headphones, and smart home products in 2021.', 'All these devices include a ton of chips — not just the central processor which can cost tens or hundreds of dollars, but also less expensive little chips for controlling the display, or managing power, or operating a 5G modem.', '“The current chip shortage all starts with the unprecedented demand for personal computers and peripherals as the globe worked and attended school from home,” said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights, a firm that studies the semiconductor industry.', 'Electronic industry giants that have reported record sales say that they could’ve been even better if there was enough supply. Apple, which recently reported a blowout $111 billion quarter, told analysts it didn’t have enough supply of its new iPhones to meet demand. CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that “semiconductors are very tight.”', 'AMD CEO Lisa Su, which makes the processor at the heart of Sony’s and Microsoft’s new consoles, said last month that it expects shortages through the first half of the year, at least. “The industry does need to increase the overall capacity levels,” Su said.', 'The shortage is highlighting a structural change in the semiconductor industry. Many of the top semiconductor companies are now “fabless,” which means that they only design the chips and the technology in them. Other companies, known as foundries, are largely contracted to actually make the chips.', 'The foundries are run by companies like TSMC in Taiwan or Samsung in South Korea -- and as it turns out, they were already making chips as fast as they could. If a company cut orders in the early days of the pandemic, they had to get back in line.', 'Carmakers aren’t directly competing with high-tech companies for the same chip supply.

Cars also use a lot of microcontrollers, which can control traditional automotive tasks like power steering, or are the brain at the heart of an infotainment system. Car makers also usually use “just-in-time” production, which means they avoid having extra parts in storage.', '“The problem is even if that 10-cent chip is missing, you can’t sell your $30,000 car,” Gaurav Gupta, semiconductor analyst at Gartner said.', '“If the chip that powers the in-car dials or automatic braking are delayed, then so will the rest of the vehicle,” Bryce Johnstone, director of automotive segment marketing at chip designer Imagination Technologies previously told CNBC.', 'Now the automotive industry is realizing it’s a lower priority than the electronics companies at the foundries. In 2020, only 3% of TSMC’s sales were from automotive chips, compared to 48% for smartphones.', 'Tech companies are “the volume guys. They have higher margins. And they never cut down their orders and have long-term contracts with the foundries,” Gupta said. “Now that this auto demand peaked faster that the OEMs had expected, autos can’t get back in the queue.”', 'The foundries are aware of the issue. TSMC, which is seen as the most advanced and important foundry, said that it was trying to help the auto companies, and said it would spend as much as $28 billion this year to increase its capacity.', '“While our capacity is fully utilized with demand from every sector, TSMC is reallocating our wafer capacity to support the worldwide automotive industry,” TSMC said in a statement in January.', 'Car manufacturers also use automotive-grade chips, which are painstakingly “qualified” against binders of industry standards to make sure they’re durable and reliable. “It is more difficult for the industry to alternatively transition its production lines and supply chains elsewhere,” Trendforce, a consulting group covering the semiconductor industry, wrote in a report last month.', 'Last last year, the U.S. placed restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), the biggest foundry in China, barring it from getting advanced chip manufacturing gear, and making it much harder to sell its finished products to companies with U.S. ties. Customers needed to shift their orders to competitors like TSMC, Gupta said.', 'SMIC executives acknowledged that the U.S. move has prevented it from using its full capacity when it said geopolitical factors would prevent it from seizing “this year’s rare market opportunity,” referring to the chip shortage.', 'Some companies also decided to stockpile essential chips ahead of the U.S. deadline, using up production capacity last year. For example, Huawei stockpiled critical radio chips ahead of sanctions, Bloomberg News reported.', 'Stockpiling was also driven by supply concerns as Covid swept across the world. SK Hynix, a major memory chip maker, said last July it saw a surge of sales driven by “growing anxiety about IT supply chain in general.”', 'Some companies that stockpiled chips are reaping the benefits now. Toyota said on Wednesday that it doesn’t expect to reduce its rate of production because it had stockpiled four months worth of chips to ride out the shortage.
