Further, Matus said the platform  will come with an open software development kit, which he  hopes app developers and other drone makers will  adopt.', 'At $1,300, Teal’s price falls in line with the  market-leading DJI Phantom  series. The drone will be available to the public early next year, and 500 units are available for  preorder now, ready to ship just ahead of the December holidays.', '“I started racing drones before they were cool, and now  there’s a big community growing out of this,” Matus said. “Teal  wants to give racers something that works out of a box, …  something they don’t have to tinker with.” Most racers either  have to modify their own drones or build one from scratch, Matus  said. But he’s looking to solve that problem.', 'And Teal isn’t just for drone racers. It’s great forthe consumer, the hobbyist, and even the person who has never flownanything before, Matus said. And the possible use cases for Tealare plenty, like taking photos andvideos, playing games, delivering packages and complete a “search andrescue mission,” Matus added.', 'In 2015, Matus was chosen from almost 3,000  applicants to be a Thiel Fellow from Peter  Thiel’s foundation.

To date, the company has raised more than $3 million, Matus said,  with plans to scale the team even further and grow production to  higher volumes into 2017.', '“Starting this company was a steep learning curve for me — learning how to raise money, build a team, build a  company,” Matus said. But after Teal’s first angel investor,  Northgate Capital’s Mark Harris, believed in Matus’ vision,  things became easier, he admitted. ', 'This year, Matus was chosen to be a competitor on the TV  show “Battlebots.”  He spent three months building a combat drone for the show, while  also working on Teal, which proved to be another “incredible  experience,” full of mistakes and much learning along the  way, Matus said.', 'With a bright future, this 18-year-old CEO has only just begun. ”[Teal’s] goal is to push what’s  possible, to push the boundaries and expand the use cases for a  drone, integrating augmented reality,” Matus said. He plans to  make his drone “as ubiquitous as a smartphone” one day.', '“The advice I would give to young entrepreneurs is  to really find what interests you, and then it doesn’t feel like  work,” Matus said. “This is my passion, and it’s what I love to  do.”']",-1

From the Ballmer years, only finance chief Amy Hood and legal head Brad Smith have stuck around with Nadella.', 'In 2014, Nadella asked each person on the senior leadership team to make an ”‘all in’ commitment as we embark on the next chapter for the company,” he wrote in a memo to employees.

He emphasized areas like cloud where Microsoft was a challenger rather than a leader, and formed partnerships with rivals like Red Hat and SAP. Nadella has insisted that Microsoft loves open-source software despite Microsoft’s past attacks on Linux, and he has made it clear that the Windows operating system, the historical core of Microsoft, was no longer the top priority.', 'Nadella also set about changing Microsoft’s cutthroat and bureaucratic culture. He encouraged employees to have a so-called “growth mindset” — the belief that people can develop new skills and knowledge with enough effort — after his wife, Anu, introduced him to the book “Mindset” by Carol Dweck years ago. Soon after becoming CEO, he asked top Microsoft executives to read “Nonviolent Communication” by Marshall Rosenberg.', 'It “was the first clear indication that Satya was going to focus on transforming not just the business strategy but the culture as well,” legal chief Brad Smith has said.', 'Nadella received $42.9 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year.

And my perspective was both need to be strong and Office will not be able to fundamentally be the thing that changes that equation one way or the other. But what it could do, if we didn’t have cross-platform, is it could reduce the value of Office and the value proposition for Office very substantially. And so we went back and forth a couple of times.

She can wear the items for as long as she wants, and can return them for a fresh batch when she’s done. Battito has also used a number of other rental services, including Le Tote and New York and Company Closet.', 'This trend isn’t lost on traditional retailers. Gap-owned Banana Republic announced Thursday plans to launch an apparel rental service to try to capture customers like Battito. Macy’s said this week it is considering starting a rental service, while its subsidiary Bloomingdale’s will launch one in mid-September. Urban Outfitters also rolled out a rental subscription box earlier this month.', 'The proliferation is in part fueled by the desire of brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt to changing consumer habits and find new revenue streams.

They can also order a single standalone box without subscribing. In 2018, the company reported $1.2 billion in sales and its active user base rose 17% to 3.1 million from the prior year.

She eventually pivoted to discuss inspirations for post-pandemic fashion and gave viewers a first look at Jimmy Choo’s upcoming summer collection.', 'Participants who had signed up in advance received a complimentary cocktail and macarons, sent in the mail ahead of the event, to sip and snack on while watching. The first 50 people who bought a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes during or immediately after the event were told they’d receive a personalized fashion sketch as a token of appreciation. There was a separate gift basket and Bloomingdale’s gift card giveaway for everyone who watched the livestream until the end.', 'Bloomingdale’s has hosted more than 50 shoppable livestreamed events during the Covid pandemic. It’s one way it has tried to reach its customers at home, when they haven’t been able to visit its brick-and-mortar stores.

Some brands have already been successful with these tools in markets such as China, where livestreaming was popularized by Alibaba. But in the U.S., livestreaming remains a risky bet for retailers. Even Amazon, which was an early adopter of the strategy, has yet to draw consistently large crowds to its livestream shopping events.', 'The hope — especially among high-end retailers like Bloomingdale’s — is that Americans are beginning to splurge on pricey clothes, shoes, purses and jewelry to show off as they dress up and leave the house again. The behavior, often referred to as “revenge spending,” has already appeared in China. Livestreaming could be one way for these companies to showcase their merchandise to consumers who are armed with cash and ready to spend.', 'In the U.S., the livestreaming market was worth about $6 billion last year and could reach $11 billion by the end of this year, according to consumer market research group Coresight Research.

Companies from Bobbi Brown to Clinique to L’Oreal have leaned into virtual shoppable events as a way to test products like lip balm and skin creams in front of customers and entice them to buy the products online, on the spot.', 'A number of bigger chains are beginning to experiment, too. Nordstrom launched its own shoppable livestream channel earlier this year. In late April, Petco hosted its first-ever livestreamed event on Facebook, which was a mix of a pet fashion show along with a dog adoption drive. The shoe brand Aldo also in late April held its first live shopping event, tapping a celebrity stylist along with a TikTok star to help show off its products.', 'Underpinning the interest from retailers is the endorsement of tech giants who have either launched or ramped up livestreaming services. TikTok has hosted shoppable livestream events with Walmart, where users can browse Walmart fashion featured by TikTok creators without having to leave the social media app. And Amazon, the biggest e-commerce player in the U.S., has embraced livestreaming on its site, featuring a rotating slate of QVC-style, interactive videos from brands and influencers at nearly all hours of the day.', 'There are more eyes and ears on retailers’ websites than ever before. Even though Americans are likely to spend less time shopping online as they begin to socialize more outside the home, this transition period is an opportunity. Retailers can offer advice on what to wear or how to apply new makeup looks. 2021 will be a year for retailers to seize the moment.', 'Weinswig said a key reason why livestreaming may soon gain momentum, particularly with younger consumers, is because of the friction it can remove in the shopping process. During a livestream, shoppers may be able to ask questions and see various sizes and colors in real time. That means shoppers are more likely to keep what they buy, she said.', '“Returns are 50% lower when items are bought in a livestream,” Weinswig said, citing Coresight data on the matter. “Because of the U.S. consumer’s focus on sustainability right now, that is what could ultimately drive livestreaming.”', 'Retailers and tech companies have closely watched Amazon’s efforts around livestream shopping, which began in earnest about six years ago.', 'Amazon first entered the livestream shopping space in 2016 with Style Code Live, a high energy show that let viewers shop while they watched hosts talk about the latest fashion trends. It brought in on-air personalities to host the show with previous experience at MTV’s “Total Request Live” and ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Style Code Live appeared poised to become QVC-style programming for the internet era before Amazon canceled the show, just 15 months after it launched.', 'Since then, Amazon’s strategy has evolved. It now operates Amazon Live, a livestreaming service that lets businesses and members of Amazon’s influencer program, both of which Amazon refers to as “creators,” show off merchandise and talk directly to shoppers.', 'Through an app called Amazon Live Creator, Amazon has democratized companies and influencers’ ability to host livestreams. With just a few taps, they can go live to Amazon’s millions of shoppers, though only a fraction of those shoppers typically tune into a stream. Under each video is a slideshow of products that can be purchased on Amazon. Influencers earn a cut of each sale made by shoppers who click through to products featured on the stream.', 'On any given day, there are dozens of Amazon Live streams with a mix of programming that can lean more on the casual or educational side. Influencers might go live to “unbox” their latest haul of beauty products or walk viewers through a full-body cardio workout that also highlights recommended bike shorts, dumbbells and yoga mats, all available to buy with just a few clicks. Another recent stream, which drew roughly 40 viewers, featured a “success coach and mind guide” who provided tips for “navigating life,” above a carousel of holistic beauty products for sale on Amazon.', 'Amazon Live has also become a fixture of the holiday shopping season and Prime Day, Amazon’s annual, two-day discount bonanza.

Last holiday season, more than 700 businesses streamed on Amazon Live, the company said.', 'Amazon declined to share Amazon Live usage data, such as the total number of companies and brands registered for the service.', 'Amazon said it encourages creators to stream longer than an hour, so that it gives viewers enough time to show up and sound off in the chat window. In the chat, viewers can talk with the host and ask questions about products featured on the stream. They can also choose to “follow” a business or influencer to get notified when they go live.', 'The ability to “follow” a creator has lent Amazon Live an air that’s similar to social media platforms like TikTok, Alphabet-owned YouTube, Facebook’s Instagram or Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. While consumers can’t see a creator’s follower count, the metric can be important for brands and influencers to improve their visibility on the platform.', 'Creators are encouraged to stream more frequently to climb internal Amazon Live rankings and “unlock more benefits.” For example, to reach “A-List” status, Amazon said companies must amass 2,000 followers and sell either 100 units or $5,000 worth of goods via livestream sales within 30 days. As creators ascend through the rankings, Amazon will reward them in certain ways, like placing their streams on the amazon.com homepage, as well as near or at the top of the Amazon Live landing page.', 'As Amazon Live has grown, the platform has become a hotspot for high-profile product launches, author Q&As and, occasionally, celebrity guests like pop star Dua Lipa, whose stream last March racked up 1.5 million views within the first 24 hours it was recorded.', 'Not all companies that sell on Amazon may have the time or resources to plan and execute livestreams.

Most people use social media as an entertainment media channel where they’re looking at it just to see what’s going on.”', 'According to Mark Yuan, who co-founded the livestreaming consultancy And Luxe, retailers shouldn’t try to do livestreaming on their own, either.', '“If choosing between a brand building their internal livestreaming capability or a marketplace where hundreds of brands and sellers and new influencers are livestreaming ...

The industry now burns fuels with a sulfur content of as high as 3.5 percent and will have to cut back to 0.5 percent.', 'For the world transportation market, the change is profound because shipping fuel is literally from the bottom of the oil barrel, like asphalt. The new fuel, however, will be much more refined and more like the lower sulfur diesel used by truckers and in jet fuel.', 'While huge investments have already been made, the change on Jan. 1 could send ripples through the transportation industry, causing estimated price spikes of 20 percent or more for fuel of all sorts.', 'As a result, cargo prices, airline tickets and the cost of sending a package could rise. Some analyst say there could even be temporary fuel shortages, as refiners and transport companies scramble to meet the needs of the shipping industry.', 'Ships can get avoid using the new fuel, which will be more expensive, by equipping themselves with multi-million dollar scrubbers to limit sulfur emissions from the current fuel. But a limited amount of ships can make those changes because it is costly and it may not be worthwhile on an older vessel.', 'The new regulations are the result of a recommendation that came from a subcommittee at the United Nations more than a decade ago and was adopted in 2016 by the UN’s IMO, which sets rules for shipping safety, security and pollution.', 'More than 170 countries including the U.S. have signed on to the fuel change. Starting in 2020, ships found in violation of the new laws risk being impounded, and ports in cooperating countries are expected to police visiting vessels.', '“This is the biggest change in fuel specifications since lead was taken out of gasoline, and it’s global,” said Tom Kloza, head of global energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. The phaseout of lead additives in fuels first began in 1970s but was mostly eliminated in the 1980s, and the final additives were banned in the 1990s.', 'The shipping industry will have to make its switch over to the new fuel on a hard deadline.', 'Some companies have added new ships that run on liquified natural gas, but that is limited. Fleets are expected to increasingly add LNG fueled ships but the transition could take a number of years. The shipping industry now uses more than 5 million barrels of fuel a day, including the high sulfur fuel, lighter marine fuel and a tiny amount of LNG, according to Citigroup.', '“The fuel now used in shipping is the bottom of the barrel. It’s a very heavy black diesel oil that shippers use because it’s cheap. It also is one of the most polluting fuels. So it’s understandable people would want to regulate it. The whole purpose of this regulation change is to protect human health. That’s why it was proposed in 2007,” said Rick Joswick, head of oil pricing and trade flow analytics at S&P Global Platts.', 'While big shortages of marine fuel are not anticipated, the price of diesel, used in trucking, could temporarily jump and become more volatile starting in the fourth quarter as ships begin to fuel up for long journeys, energy analysts say. The actual impact is difficult to measure, because it will also be driven by oil prices, and it could affect other fuels too.', '“We’ve been heavily involved in tracking this for the past year. It’s going to increase the cost of fuel,” said Glen Kedzie, vice president and energy and environmental counsel for the American Trucking Association, which represents more than 800 trucking fleets. “You will not come across any study that says this will make fuel prices cheaper. The fact is we’re kind of shifting the dynamics of who is competing for the middle blend of distillates. You’re kind of pushing another industry into that sector that includes heating oil, jet fuel and transportation fuel.”', 'By extension, that means that businesses that use these fuels — from airlines to container shippers to farmers and trucking firms — will pay higher prices and could potentially pass along any price hikes to consumers. It’s also conceivable that refineries could replace some of their gasoline production with marine fuel, if prices go high enough, analysts say.', '“There’s enough of the new fuel. It’s never been a question of the refineries’ ability to supply the fuel. It’s really a matter of what price ships are going to have to pay for essentially diesel fuel. It’s a switch from high sulfur, low value fuel which was also sold for less,” said Kurt Barrow, IHS Vice President of Oil Markets, Midstream and Downstream. “The refiners have always been willing to provide diesel. It’s just a matter of the cost associated with that, particularly when you have a 3 million barrel overnight change. We’re going to increase crude runs. We’re going to utilize the global refinery system.”', 'Kloza said the price of truck fuel diesel at the pump could rise above $4 per gallon, from the current national average of about $2.95 per gallon. “Higher prices for diesel and for freight, for shipping by trucks, they work their way through the system and they’re passed along as inflation. When you have higher prices for diesel for a sustained amount of time, it’s not something that resonates through the population like with gasoline, but it’s something that can resonate through inflation and raise the price of goods a little bit.”', 'While the price of all fuels could rise, Goldman Sachs commodity strategists in a recent report said they do not expect a big impact on distillate prices or supply because of anticipated weaker demand for diesel from truckers and lower oil prices. They also expect more ships to add scrubbers.', 'Eric Lee, Citigroup energy analyst, however, said it’s likely fuel costs will rise, starting at the end of the year, and refiners’ margins on diesel will also rise. In one scenario, if Brent crude reaches $70 in the fourth quarter, he said diesel fuel could rise to as much as $3.35 per gallon. He said gasoline prices could also rise.', 'Joswick said the wholesale price of diesel could rise by 20 percent to 25 percent as the shipping industry changes over. “This will hit the market probably in the third quarter. Right now, it’s totally under the radar with respect to prices ... and it’s understandable. Bunker fuel is just something that makes people’s eyes glaze over,” he said.', '“Things like diesel fuel and jet fuel would go up. It’s not the 3 million barrel a day market. It’s the much larger diesel and jet fuel market,” said Joswick. “The diesel market is about 30 million barrels a day. The jet market is about 8 million barrels a day. This 3 million swing in bunker fuel will affect the 38 million and the 3 million barrels of diesel fuel it uses.”', 'Each barrel of oil that enters a refinery contains the makings for a range of fuels, the prominent one being gasoline. A certain amount is refined as high sulfur fuel and also asphalt, at the bottom of the barrel. There is the middle of the barrel, which provides the lower sulfur distillates — diesel, jet fuel and heating oil. Gasoline and lighter fuels are at the top. Kedzie said the marine fuel is from that middle tier, and could also be made by blending a higher sulfur fuel with diesel.', '“There’s a school of thought that thinks the new shipping rules will trigger a Y2K, and there’s a school of thought that thinks it will cause the next Apocalypse. I’m leaning toward quite a bit of disruption and impact on prices. It’s really going to have an impact on the vessels and what they have to use,” said Kloza. “For diesel, I think it’s going to mean that diesel prices on the coasts of the United States are going to be significantly higher than they are on the interior.”', '', 'Sulfur emissions from ships are currently very high, and Kloza said one study showed the annual emissions from one large container ship was comparable to the emissions from 10 to 15 million cars running on diesel fuel.', '“On the diesel side, I think it’s clear it’s got to prop up diesel prices so there’s the potential possibility of a spike in diesel prices next winter, and heating oil,” said Kloza. “You’re talking about rolling out a new marine fuel right in the winter of the northern hemisphere.” He added, “If that market for marine fuel is high enough, the stuff that normally gets turned into gasoline and on road diesel is going to go to the vessel market.”', 'But Citigroup’s Lee and other analysts said there could be a response from President Donald Trump if diesel or other fuels rise very much. The president has periodically lambasted OPEC for high oil prices, including in a tweet on Monday that knocked the price of crude down by three percent.', '“If you have this combination of a pick up in diesel prices, gasoline prices and shipping costs are higher, freight costs are higher and that filters through to other commodities. It’s the kind of thing the White House might be inclined to delay or push back on,” said Lee. “There will be some headline risk out of the White House, there could be other tweets that push us back late this year, early next year, as it’s an election year.”', 'While Trump could allow lax enforcement of the new regulations, ships traveling the world would still have to be in compliance if they wish to stop in other ports outside of the U.S. that are enforcing the new regulations. Analysts expect about 15 percent of the ships on the high seas to be non-compliant.', 'If fuel prices rise too much, the refining industry could be self-policing, and move quickly to provide more fuel. “My thing is the refining industry has a good track record of averting disaster. While it is concerning, I wouldn’t panic over it. There’s no greater incentive to race more production than if prices skyrocket,” said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital.', 'The concern is that the rule change is global, and the U.S. is far from the largest user of high sulfur fuel with Singapore and Rotterdam being major bunker ports. “You’re going to have a lot of folks competing for a fixed asset, and it’s a global market,” said American Trucking Association official Kedzie. “Just because it might be refined here doesn’t mean it has to be used here. There’s no law that says any crude that’s pumped in this country or any product that’s refined in a U.S. refinery has to stay in the United States.”', 'The Coalition for American Energy Security said it believes the rule change provides a big opportunity for U.S. refined product exports and that recent analyses show the U.S. industry is on track to meet demand.', '“IMO 2020 presents an enormous economic opportunity for the U.S. energy industry and its workers to supply low-sulfur fuels to the global market. These standards give the U.S. a significant advantage over foreign oil producers whose nations haven’t made necessary infrastructure investments,” a spokesman said.', 'Ultimately, the markets should calm down, but it’s difficult to tell just how much volatility there will be and how high prices could go, with the price of crude a major mitigating factor. Joswick said the heavy sulfur fuel is from about 3 percent of the world’s oil output.', 'IHS Markit’s Barrow estimates that perhaps 600,000 barrels a day of the higher sulfur fuel will continued to be used by ships with scrubbers. “Ships can either buy this new fuel which is more expensive or they could spend a few million dollars of capital to install a scrubber. We’ve seen a significant increase in orders and installation of scrubbers starting in 2018,” he said.', '“Another 400,000 or 500,000 [barrels of bunker fuel] could be in noncompliance....Our analysis says some of the ships coming out of the ship yards will be designed with more efficient engines that use the new fuel,” he said. “Some in certain kinds of trade, particularly container vessels, those are in the future going to use LNG. Some cruise ships have put on scrubbers.”', 'Carnival, for one, said it already has scrubbers on most of its ships, and it has plans to add 11 LNG ships to its fleet over the next five years. “The Advanced Air Quality Systems (generically known as exhaust gas cleaning systems, or scrubbers) are installed on 71 of the company’s more than 100 ships and, through extensive independent testing, the systems have proven capable of outperforming low-sulfur fuel alternatives such as marine gasoil (MGO) in terms of cleaner air emissions with essentially no negative environmental impact to oceans and seas,” a spokesman said in an email.', '', 'Randal Mullett, transportation industry consultant with Mullett Strategies, said shippers will find ways to save on fuel costs.', '“They’ve indicated they’re anticipating huge increases in their costs, and perhaps there are some other implications, like they revert to slow steaming to save fuel. That has big implications on supply chain,” he said, noting cargoes could arrive days later than normal if ships slow their travel speed.', 'Some analysts say the cost to shippers could rise by a third or more if they have to switch from high sulfur fuel to low sulfur fuel.', 'Joswick said he expects U.S. refiners to easily handle the increase in marine fuel.', '“Refineries have a certain amount of flexibility and they respond to price. They all run their models to simulate how they can get the best margins,” he said. “U.S. refiners are very well positioned to do this. Refineries in Europe will be more challenged. The effect of this is price has to move [higher] for this to happen.”', 'Lee said the complex refiners along the Gulf Coast will benefit from the fuel change and they can easily respond to the demand. “The U.S. is very well positioned,” he said.', 'He said the adjustment period for the transportation industry could last a few years.', '“By 2022, into 2023, prices will have normalized and there’s a new mix of fuel use in the shipping sector. On day one, diesel demand jumps and high sulfur fuel demand drops significantly,” Lee said. “Scrubbers are being installed and refiners are building more capacity. They aren’t doing it all on day one. It’s more a slow progression.”']",-1

They support newer and faster 5G networks and have better cameras, great screens and an updated design. Most people should choose the iPhone 12. Buy the iPhone 12 Pro if you want a few extra camera tricks.', 'Both phones launch on Friday, Oct. 23, and will be followed by the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max in November. I haven’t tested those models yet. If they sound appealing to you, then you might want to wait another month before making your final decision.', 'The iPhone 12 launch is a big deal for Apple. Bullish analysts think the company will enter a new “iPhone super cycle.” An estimated 30% or more of iPhone owners are using a phone that’s at least three years old. This means about 420 million iPhone owners will be ready to upgrade in 2021, according to Loup Ventures.', 'These are also the first iPhones with 5G, which matters if you’re buying a phone you plan to use for a few years, even if 5G isn’t fully available in the U.S. yet. And it’s important for Apple in other countries where 5G is more mature, such as China, where Apple competes with Huawei.', 'But there’s a bear case, too. We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and jobless claims in the U.S. jumped again on Oct. 15. Economic uncertainty could push people to hold off on buying a new phone. But Apple sold more Macs, iPads and iPhones than expected during its fiscal third quarter. So we know people were still buying gadgets in the first few months of the pandemic.', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are the first iPhones to support 5G networks. Before I talk about the phones, I should explain 5G, since carriers and Apple are using it as the key selling point. As you’ve probably heard, 5G is still in its early days, and there’s a good chance you won’t be able to use it to its full potential yet.', 'The new iPhones support all kinds of 5G, including the fastest networks in the U.S. But 5G is super confusing right now, so I’ll explain what’s going on.', 'First, the 5G speeds you see will entirely depend on where you’re using the phone. The common 5G network most people will see most often right now is sometimes faster than LTE. It can also sometimes be slower than 4G LTE. But, as long as you’re on 5G, the iPhone 12 will let you do things that earlier iPhones needed Wi-Fi for.', 'That meant FaceTime in HD, which was noticeably clearer than over LTE. It’ll also download software updates and play videos from the Apple TV app at the highest possible quality. Anyway, this is the sort of experience you should mostly expect right now if you’re covered by 5G.', 'Then there’s another flavor of faster 5G that’s still being built out but will eventually offer speeds many times faster than 4G LTE both indoors and outdoors. This is when you’ll see big differences in movie and TV show download times and when 5G will really start to matter. I think I ran into some of T-Mobile’s new network in Livingston, New Jersey, where I saw speeds about twice as fast as I did at home on slower 5G.', 'And finally there’s the really fast 5G that’s bragged about the most. Verizon is the most bullish on this, though T-Mobile and AT&T are also building it. It’s mostly in cities. I’ve tested in Manhattan on other phones when I was able to download movies and TV shows in seconds but didn’t come across it on the iPhone 12 in the New Jersey suburbs, where it has yet to roll out.', 'The fastest flavor of 5G is as finicky as it is speedy: You need to be outside and basically on the same street corner as the tower. It’ll matter one day for things that need really fast and low-latency connections, like maybe if self-driving cars ever launch and need to stop on a dime. But, for now, consider yourself lucky if you happen to have it in your backyard. Otherwise it’s a bit like a treasure hunt trying to find it, and it doesn’t matter much for most people.', 'Mostly, we’re still waiting for developers to show us what we can do with 5G. One thing I’m excited for is cloud gaming. Amazon’s new Luna service will let you stream popular console games to your iPhone, for example. Apple hasn’t yet worked out deals with Google and Microsoft to allow their competing services in their current form, though.', 'The good news is you don’t really have to worry about 5G on the iPhone. It has an auto-detect option that will use 5G most of the time but can smartly switch to 4G LTE if you’re doing something like streaming music in your pocket and it thinks 5G will hurt battery life.', 'I didn’t see this happen, since it does this when the screen isn’t on. You can always just force your phone to stay on 5G or on 4G LTE, too, in case 4G LTE is still faster where you live. (Pro tip: I use the SpeedTest app to try this. Make sure your Wi-Fi is off.)', 'So, that’s 5G. The bottom line is you don’t have to worry about it too much now, but you’ll be in a good spot in a few years once the networks are more capable.', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are more alike than the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. I often had a hard time telling the new models apart until I looked at the cameras on the back.', 'The first thing you’ll notice on the new iPhones is the super bright and colorful screen. It’s probably one of the highlight features outside of 5G. And, this year, Apple gave the regular iPhone 12 an OLED screen, instead of the LCD panel it used on the iPhone 11.', 'It’s just way, way better than LCD and matters for things such as viewing pictures, playing games and watching movies. A scene in “Mad Max: Fury Road” where a car explodes in a dust storm really stood out, since the orange flames contrast so well against the black smoke in the sky. The stereo speakers are great for watching movies, too. They sound full and get really loud.', 'I love the new blue color I reviewed. The iPhone 12 also comes in pale green, red, black and white. It has a premium feel, and is made from glass and aluminum. I love how light it is without feeling cheap.', 'I asked Apple about the throwback design, which is similar to 2010′s iPhone 4 (and the current iPad Pro and iPad Air) with flat edges and sharper corners. Apple said it helps the phone’s durability if it drops. And while I didn’t drop the phone to find out, Apple also claims the new “Ceramic Shield” glass on the front is four times more resistant to damage from drops. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are more water resistant and can survive under 6 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. I don’t shower with my phones, but you could if you wanted to.', 'Most new phones have excellent cameras. Google and Samsung phones always impress me. But it comes down to personal preference, and I still prefer the pictures and videos from an iPhone.', 'I took the iPhone 12 out for a walk in the park over the weekend and loved how both the regular wide-angle and the ultra-wide-angle lenses captured lots of detail and accurate colors, from the hair on my dog Mabel to trees against a deep blue sky.', 'The front-facing selfie camera is still great, but you can see here it missed one arm of my sunglasses.', 'Apple improved pictures shot at night, too, and also offers better selfies without flash even if it’s really dark out. Sometimes they were still a little blurry, though, so get a tripod or prop your iPhone on something sturdy to avoid that. Portrait shots in the day still look the best. My dog, Mabel, for example:', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are the first phones to support recording video in “Dolby Vision” HDR. I didn’t think it was a big deal until I tried it. Video recorded in HDR at 4K and 30 frames per second looks great. Dolby Vision helped brighten areas that were otherwise washed out or dark, even in my relatively dim living room with a few table lamps. You don’t have to think about it or fiddle with settings, though, your videos will just look better. The iPhone 12 Pro supports Dolby Video HDR at 4K and a smoother 60 frames per second.', 'Battery life is great. I took the iPhone 12 off the charger at about 7:34 a.m. and it still had a 51% charge at 5 p.m. That’s with a lot of use on 5G networks and the screen at about 75% brightness. I think light users will get through more than a day of use before having to charge, though I still regularly charge my iPhone at night when I go to bed and Apple promises a full day of use. That’s impressive for such a thin phone and, if you need it, you can get up to a 50% charge in 30 minutes with a 20-watt charger.', 'Finally, the iPhone 12 feels really fast. It has a new A14 Bionic processor that helps with all sorts of things, like opening large games quicker than my iPhone 11 Pro Max to improving the photos and videos.', 'I didn’t run into anything that felt sluggish on the iPhone. Games looked about as good as they did on my iPhone 11, although developers can probably make them even better with the added graphics performance. But it’s still pretty wild how some games, like “Genshin Impact” have huge worlds with great graphics.', 'Now for some bad news.', 'There’s no plug in the box, just the cable with a new type of connector at the bottom based on USB-C. Apple says it’s doing this to cut down its carbon footprint.', 'The more cynical take: Apple’s decision not to include the plug forces you to buy a new one from the company because it has that USB-C connector, not the regular USB port you’re used to seeing on Apple’s plugs since 2007. There’s a small chance you have the necessary USB-C plug already in your house, or a computer with USB-C ports that can charge the phone. This is a great way for Apple to boost its revenue by about $20 for most iPhone 12s it sells. But it’s a bad experience for you.', 'So what should you buy so you can actually charge your new iPhone 12? I recommend you get Apple’s $20 20-watt USB-C power adapter or Anker’s similarly priced 20-watt charger from Amazon.', 'Take everything I talked about with the iPhone 12 and then add a few things and you have the iPhone 12 Pro.', 'The iPhone 12 Pro is made out of steel instead of aluminum, which is heavier but looks a bit nicer. The back is matte and doesn’t attract fingerprints like the iPhone 12.', 'There’s an extra telephoto lens that works great. It helps you zoom in without losing quality in your pictures. And speaking of pictures, the new lidar sensor helps with depth, which means even more accurate portrait shots, where the background is blurred and the subject is in focus.', 'That means you can take pictures like this wide-angle:', 'And this ultra-wide:', 'And this 2x telephoto, which you don’t get on the iPhone 12:', 'And the iPhone 12 Pro has support for portrait pictures at night, something the iPhone 12 lacks. It worked well when I tested it with a clock in my office at night. It was almost completely dark, but the iPhone still took this picture without flash:', 'It’s not perfect, though. Notice the handle of the clock is still blurry. Here’s another night portrait picture of flowers. Again, it was totally dark outside:', 'That lidar sensor does double duty for augmented reality. AR lets you drop digital objects on top of the real world.', 'Sometimes it’s really cool, like if you’re using Wayfair to buy furniture and want to know if a couch will fit in your room before you buy it.', 'The lidar sensor quickly generates a mesh map of the room you’re in, so you can accurately place a painting, drop a pool table in your kitchen or a tile swatch on the wall to see if something fits.', 'The regular iPhone 12, which doesn’t have a lidar sensor, makes you wave your phone’s camera around the room for about 10 seconds before you can plop an object down.', 'And the lidar sensor helps with accuracy for things such as measuring. I used it on a measuring tape to check its accuracy and it nailed it. This is useful if you want to use your iPhone’s measuring app to see the length, width or height of something.', 'I don’t think anyone can top Apple when it comes to video recording on a phone. The Dolby Vision HDR support I talked about on the regular iPhone 12 works at up to 60 frames per second, which means even smoother 4K recording while maintaining the really good accuracy between bright and dark parts of your scene. People who film and edit with their iPhones will dig this. Normal folks might not care about the added smoothness on the 12 Pro, but they’ll get a version of it in the regular iPhone 12, too.', 'Speaking of HDR, the screen gets a bit brighter on the iPhone 12 Pro than it does on the iPhone 12, but only when HDR is in use. So, it has a greater peak brightness when needed.', 'I didn’t see a discernible difference in battery life between the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro, likely because they share so many of the same components. Expect all-day battery life.', 'Lastly, if you want a larger 6.7-inch screen, then you have to get the iPhone 12 Pro Max. It’ll ship in November, when the smaller iPhone 12 Mini also launches.', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro use a fun new “MagSafe” magnetic accessory system. The name was first used back when Apple’s MacBook chargers had magnets that held them in place.', 'MagSafe is used for wireless charging and for sticking accessories to the back of your iPhone. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro still work with regular wireless charging pads, but they’ll juice up twice as fast — 15 watts instead of 7.5 watts — with the MagSafe charger. It magnetically sticks to the back of the phone.', 'MagSafe works well, though I wish the charging puck didn’t slide off tables so easily. Apple partners such as Belkin are building some pretty nice stands, though, and Apple says more MagSafe products are coming.', 'Apple’s new cases work with MagSafe, too, so the wireless charging puck still attaches even if you have a case on. You can attach things like a new leather wallet to the back of the iPhone 12, though I found that the magnet wasn’t strong enough to keep the wallet on while it was sliding around in in my pocket.', 'Oh, and the MagSafe charger works with older iPhones that have wireless charging, they just don’t attach magnetically.', 'MagSafe is a fun new system. It’ll probably help drive accessory revenue even more for Apple. I’m excited to see what Apple and its partners bring in the future.', 'I think most people shopping for a phone right now should choose the iPhone 12, and I expect that will be the most popular model. It’s the one I ordered, though part of me wonders if maybe I’ll like the bigger iPhone 12 Pro Max better. We’ll see when that launches in November.', 'The iPhone 12 has great cameras, an awesome screen, excellent battery life and future-proofs you with 5G. If you want some extra camera tricks, lidar for augmented reality and better portrait photos, and a more premium design, check out the iPhone 12 Pro. If you want something smaller, maybe wait for the $699 iPhone 12 Mini. Likewise, wait for the $1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max if you want even better zoom cameras and a bigger screen. I’m excited to check those out.', 'If you want to save money, consider the $599 iPhone 11, which is still great but doesn’t have as nice of a screen, the latest processor or 5G. This year’s iPhone SE is an awesome tiny phone if you don’t want to spend much more than $400.', 'Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. ']",102

It promises to provide a hotter, more satisfying shower using less water than traditional models.', 'I went to their offices, disrobed and took a 10 minute shower. I’ll tell you what it’s like.', 'First, some background.', 'Nebia seems a lot like a technology company: Gabriel Parisi-Amon, its CEO and co-founder, wrangled iPhone parts in Apple’s supply chain before designing the shower head. Nebia’s based in an industrial neighborhood in San Francisco that’s packed with software startups. Its investors include some high-profile executives: Apple CEO Tim Cook, The Schmidt Family Foundation and Fitbit CEO James Park.', 'But Nebia by Moen, which launched this week, is not digital technology. There’s no chip, no app and no software.', 'Instead, Nebia is a bet that non-software companies can combine product design techniques borrowed from some of the Valley’s most iconic firms with the marketing and online sales practices used by other tech-adjacent companies to sell products in stodgy sectors like mattresses, suitcases and now, plumbing fixtures.', '“When you’re making a new product, you have to look at it with a blank slate and an open mind,” co-founder and chief marketing officer Phillip Winter said.', 'When Nebia was building prototypes of its shower heads, Parisi-Amon said it discovered that a 3D printer produced special nozzles faster than a supplier could ship them. This allowed for more frequent tests, more data and a faster development process.', 'The founders are aware they’re selling a physical product that needs to be manufactured, warehoused, and shipped. Unlike software, you can’t produce another physical unit for free, so the margins are lower. And while the startup was founded in 2014, shortly after Google bought Nest and spurred a wave of investment in technology hardware companies, the sector has cooled. Investment in the sector declined during the last three years, according to Crunchbase.', 'Winter told CNBC that his firm sold 20,000 units of its Nebia Spa Shower model, which launched in 2015 for $500. But unit sales are likely to increase. In the past two years, Nebia forged a partnership with Moen, a major Ohio-based designer of faucets and fixtures, which teamed with the startup to develop and produce the Nebia by Moen', 'The Nebia shower that head launched this week ships in May, is Moen-branded and costs $200. It’ll be available in home improvement stores later this year.', 'I went to their offices, disrobed and took a 10 minute shower to see what it was like.', 'Nebia’s founders say that getting investors under the shower is their key to getting so many big-name people on board.', 'The company built a private shower inside what used to be a server closet in its loft office in San Francisco and encourages prospective employees, investors, and journalists like me to try it out. It can be awkward, Parisi-Amon said, but people who become involved with the startup nearly always accept the shower.', 'Cook invested after he tried a prototype at a Silicon Valley gym, Winter said. He became the company’s first investor and has provided ongoing support. Moen signed on board after executives found the shower reminded them of a Tesla.', 'It’s not a typical shower — it mists water instead of dumping it on you. Parisi-Amon recommended letting it run and mist for up to a minute before getting in. Low heat is a common complaint with so-called “low flow” showers. I was able to adjust the angle and height of the shower head, bringing it closer to my head for a hotter, more intense shower. It was definitely warm enough for me, and I like hot showers.', 'I like the design, too. The shower head is clad in aluminum, like a MacBook or iPhone, and it has thoughtful touches, like a magnetic mount for a detachable shower hose. The part where the water comes out of is a graceful, curved loop, with six different jets that spray mist. It looks premium.', '$200 or $500 seems like a lot to spend on a plumbing fixture when hardware stores sell comparable products for as little as $20 or less, though those are typically mostly made of plastic. Winter says the cost doesn’t seem as high when you consider that water costs money, and the Nebia product uses less water than competitors.', '“The payback period is fast,” Winter said. “A family of four in NYC will be paid back in less than a year,” he said of the savings.', 'For now, even after the partnership with Moen, Nebia is launching its newest shower head on Kickstarter. It believes Kickstarter customers give detailed feedback and will provide cash flow benefits to the company.

Thalheimer told CNBC that Regent wants to make trips between coastal cities fast, safe, affordable and reliable with the smallest possible environmental footprint. (The company’s name is an acronym for Regional Electric Ground Effect Naval Transport.)', 'The seagliders that Regent designed technically fall in the category of Wing in Ground Effect craft, or WIGs. They have not historically been regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, but instead by the U.S. Coast Guard.', 'Importantly, Regent is developing its seagliders to work with existing harbor infrastructure, the CEO says. He notes that charging is still needed at harbors for mainstream adoption of electric vehicles there, whether electric air taxis, boats or ground vehicles.', 'The company will seek to establish passenger routes between major hubs like Boston and New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, or shorter routes like New York City to the Hamptons or routes connecting the islands of Hawaii.', 'But for now, with $9 million in fresh seed funding in hand, the start-up is focusing on a prototype.', '“We’re going to be flying a quarter-scale prototype by the end of this year,” said Thalheimer. “The prototype will have about a 15-foot wingspan, and will weigh about 400 pounds. We need to make sure it works in representative operational environments, like in waves and different weather.”', 'The company is expecting to do its first flight in the Boston area, but is shopping around for someplace to conduct testing elsewhere during the harsh New England winters.', 'Unlike prior generations in tech, Thalheimer says, working on a start-up that deals in atoms not just bits and bytes is easier than ever. Regent is following the success of robotics and electric vehicle companies like Kiva Robotics, Tesla, DJI and others.', '“Investors were excited about this. And we’re hearing from a lot of cities saying come here, and we’ll help you,” Thalheimer said. “We think the Boston culture is helping us today. We’re in the MIT, Harvard ecosystem. And we have great connections and in the robotics and aerospace scene here.” (Among other things, Boston is home to companies like Raytheon and Draper Laboratory.)', 'Investors in Regent’s flying ferry business include Caffeinated Capital, an early backer of supersonic jet startup Boom, Mark Cuban, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Y Combinator and others.', 'Caffeinated Capital founder Raymond Tonsing said he sees Regent embodying the future of electric aircraft, with super fast ferry service even potentially competing with autos someday.', '“Basically, we’re in a transition away from using fossil fuels to get from A to B, including when you’re not touching the ground. And you know? This is a massive market, and I think Regent has a very good plan to be flying passengers in about a 4-year period.”', 'The relatively quick go-to-market plan exists in no small part because the company expects to deal with the rules and regulations that govern maritime vessels, not airplanes, Tonsing explained.', 'It takes longer to get a new jet plane approved to fly passengers. While safety is still paramount, a WIG will fly in lower air space, over waves.

Google’s parent company Alphabet was up 7%. Netflix reported nearly double the amount of new subscribers it had anticipated for the quarter. Apple made up for of its lost iPhone sales with digital services like App Store sales and subscriptions.

In the digital advertising world, Facebook and Google both said sales saw steep declines in mid-March, but started to stabilize in April. Those comments excited investors, sending the stocks even higher.', 'Apple also said April was looking better. Its sales took a hit earlier than Facebook and Google due to Apple’s exposure in China, which went under lockdown months before the U.S. and the rest of the world.

Snap in particular seems in a great position to take advantage of the trend, and its stock was up 36% the day after it reported earnings.', 'But it was a different story for Twitter, which has had difficulty beefing up the tech infrastructure it needs for DR ads.

It’s hard to make an argument against Google and Apple’s buybacks given how well positioned they still are to make it through the coronavirus pandemic.', 'Apple was the first major tech company to issue a formal warning on its earnings due to the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down most of China early in the year. In its revised guidance in February, Apple said it saw decreased demand and hangups in its supply chain.', 'But despite a 7.5% decline in revenue from China last quarter, Apple said it was able to make up for it thanks to a spike in sales of digital services like Apple Music subscriptions and App Store sales.', 'Apple has massive exposure in China, relying on the country to manufacture its product and boost its sales. The company has spent the last year and change rebuilding its China business, and was able to stave off a major downturn despite the effects of the pandemic.

For one, it’s the  first holiday season in which its shoppers can pick  up their online orders in-store, a tactic that’s led to additional purchases 25 percent of the time.', '  It’s also the first Christmas that its new loyalty program has  been rolled out in earnest, with more than 34 million shoppers  now enlisted. By combining this initiative and its Kohl’s charge card  memberships, the retailer is using customer data to provide shoppers with more  relevant promotions and store visits, to encourage future purchases. ', 'But while analysts are optimistic about the strategic moves  Kohl’s is making, they’re not yet convinced it will be enough  to combat an influx of inventory in the sector, or a general  slowdown among department stores.', '  Though Kohl’s reiterated last month that it expects to earn  between $4.40 and $4.60 this year, consensus estimates trail  that forecast, at $4.31, according to Thomson Reuters. ', '  “Over the last 12 months, management has admirably bitten the  bullet to focus on change initiatives,” Evercore ISI analyst Omar  Saad said. “However, we believe these efforts may not be enough  to counter balance the falling tide.”', '  Kohl’s has offered a store-branded charge card since the 1970s.  But only recently did it realize the “fertile ground” of data  that could be mined from analyzing customers’ purchase behaviors, said  Will Setliff, Kohl’s executive vice president of marketing.', '  To capture insights from even more shoppers, the retailer decided to introduce a  tender-agnostic loyalty program, called Yes2You. Since launching nationally last  October, Kohl’s has more than tripled its membership base from the roughly 10 million it had during testing; it’s also doubled its email database.', 'Combined with the information from its credit customers, the company is now able to  track 80 percent of its purchases to known shoppers  — numbers typically reserved for the likes of grocery stores or  pharmacies, which can receive multiple visits from a shopper each week.', '  “The amount of customer data we have has just absolutely  exploded,” Setliff said.', '  The more frequently members shop with Kohl’s, the more the  company learns about their behavior. That means if someone consistently purchases young girls’ clothing, Kohl’s can send  them emails when it launches a new toy property that would appeal to a child around that age.', '  It can also pool customer analytics by location, to make its floorsets match the wants of customers who shop there. In the Northeast, for example, its exclusive Jennifer Lopez line is more popular than in other parts of the country.', 'Setliff said one of the biggest challenges the retailer faces is converting  new shoppers into returning visitors. To do so, his team looks at the  customer’s initial purchase behavior, and offers additional incentives to get them to come back.', '  “If a new customer doesn’t shop again within 30 days, they’ll  lapse pretty much permanently,” he said. “We have a very short  window to give them a reason to come back to the store.”', 'Once Kohl’s has built rapport with a shopper, the next step is  getting them to enroll in a store-branded charge card. Credit consumers are crucial to the company’s sales performance, as they account for a whopping 60 percent of its $19  billion in annual revenue. ', 'Converting loyalty members into credit customers remains a huge opportunity for  Kohl’s, as more than half of its loyalty members do not yet have  a charge card, according to Stifel Nicolaus. ', '  To encourage more sign-ups, the company is now prescreening  shoppers to see if they meet the requirements to qualify. Kohl’s  then tells shoppers what type of discounts they could receive as a member.', '  In an effort to further build allegiance to its stores, the retailer has integrated its loyalty program into the updated Kohl’s mobile app,  providing customers with a wallet where they can see their  rewards and other offers. Then, by scanning an item’s bar code,  shoppers can see not only the initial price tag, but how much it  would ultimately cost them. ', '  The majority of the 9 million people who have downloaded the  retailer’s app use it to view their wallet, or to see how many  reward points they have, said Krista Berry, chief digital  officer of Kohl’s.', '  Mark Taylor, an expert on digital customer experience at  Capgemini Consulting, said the team at Kohl’s is applying  “interesting techniques” to build customer loyalty. He emphasized  that for loyalty programs in general to truly engage with  customers, they need to offer more than purchase-based rewards.', '  Some examples of what Taylor considers best practices —  including rewarding customers for interacting with the brand on  social media, or creating a central place to house all of their interactions with the retailer — are being  employed by Kohl’s.', '  “They’ve really made some tremendous strides,” Taylor said. ', '  Kohl’s isn’t just relying on a robust loyalty program to help  capture more sales. Other initiatives include the rollout of an expanded beauty department to its entire fleet. Because beauty items  by their nature need to be replenished, these departments have  helped increase the number of visits to its stores as well as  the number of items a shopper has placed in their basket.', '  Kohl’s also rolled out a more extensive activewear selection,  including a built-out presence for Nike and Columbia. Along those lines, it’s also  increased the amount of space dedicated to national brands, which  help it attract new customers.', 'Of all the changes it’s made, Setliff and Berry agreed that the biggest game changer for Kohl’s  this holiday season is that shoppers can now pick up their  online orders in any of its 1,000-plus stores. ', 'Over the Black  Friday and Cyber Week shopping period, the company said roughly a  quarter of Kohls.com purchases were fulfilled by stores, either  via customer pickup or the retailer shipping the order from a  store’s inventory.', '  Berry added that the week of Thanksgiving, the retailer had four  record days on digital that were “not even remotely close to last year.”', '  “We’re off to an amazing start for holiday,” she said.', '  According to Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen, there are several external factors driving Kohl’s outperformance of one of its key  competitors, Macy’s. These include an added emphasis on activewear, its lack of dependence on tourism, and less exposure to slowing brands such as Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren.', '  Still, some analysts are hesitant that Kohl’s initiatives will be  enough to offset an overabundance of inventory throughout the  retail sector, and shrinking sales among the department store  set. Whereas department stores in October 2005 generated $18  billion in sales, according to the Commerce Department, they  pulled in just $14 billion during the same month in 2015.', '  For Kohl’s specifically, revenues have remained stationary,  coming in at roughly $19 billion for the past several years.', 'Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe, who has a “buy” rating on  Kohl’s, said he’s optimistic about the company’s performance  during the fourth quarter.', '  “The company’s strategic initiatives that were put in place over  the last year continue to play out favorably,” he said. “We  anticipate a continuation of positive [comparable sales] and are encouraged  for holiday.”']",100

OneWeb has raised $3.4 billion since its inception in 2012, with investments from a wide variety of sources: Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, Mexican conglomerate Grupo Salinas, Qualcomm, the Rwandan government, Virgin Group, Coca-Cola, Airbus, Intelsat, EchoStar-owned Hughes Communications and Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises. According to PitchBook, OneWeb was valued at $14 billion in June 2017, during a failed acquisition attempt by Intelsat.', 'But likely the most ambitious internet constellation effort is SpaceX’s Starlink. Musk’s company has been steadily fundraising this year. Starlink would include as many as 30,000 satellites when completed and President Gwynne Shotwell claimed recently that her company’s network is far ahead of OneWeb, saying “we have far more capacity per satellite than our competitors.” SpaceX launched 60 Starlink satellites in May, expects to launch another 60 Starlink satellites next week and aims to be launching 60 every other week soon.', 'Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.', '', 'The last category is the smallest by total market value, but, thanks to the past decade of private investment, the imagery and data analysis category may be the fastest to grow in the coming years.', 'Essentially four space companies in one, Maxar Technologies could easily be included in either national security or satellite communications.

It  allowed Lego to manufacture sets based on the movies, with  instructions showing builders how to turn 2,000 tiny plastic  bricks into the Death Star.', 'Fourteen years later the Walt Disney Company bought Lucasfilm  for $4 billion,  with the licensing deal still very much in place. Countless Lego  products tied in with the franchise followed, and the Lego Group  went on to manufacture sets based on other popular movie  franchises, such as “Harry Potter” and “The Avengers.”', 'Licensing is part of an overall strategy that’s made the Lego  Group wildly successful. According to its 2015 annual report, Lego Group made $1.4 billion in net profit, more than double what  it made just four years earlier. But while this is good news for  Lego, it’s created a tough situation for some consumers.', '  The Lego Group still creates sets priced well within the modest  reach of a child’s allowance, but parents who have taken their  kids to the toy store know perfectly well that there is no  appetite for a 30-piece set that can be built in five minutes.  Kids want one of the high-end sets with thousands of pieces, and  those can retail for hundreds of dollars.', '  If that were a one-time expense, parents might be willing to make  an exception, but it rarely is. Often, the child will just want  another set seconds after finishing the  last one and putting it on the shelf to be forever ignored. If  the parent relents and buys another such set in the same month,  the expense can become equal to that of a car lease payment.', '  Luckily, parents of Lego-obsessed youngsters can breathe a sigh  of relief. Netbricks, a company based in Elk Grove  Village, Illinois, offers the opportunity to rent Lego sets for a  monthly fee. There are several tiers, such as the Master plan,  which allows 60-day rentals of $400 worth of Lego sets for $49 a  month. At the end of the 60-day period, the sets are shipped  back free of charge and new sets are shipped to the  subscriber.', '  Company president Rick Weil founded it after experiencing the  same thing that so many other parents do. In other words, he was  hemorrhaging money on Legos for his kids and wondered if there  was a way to slow the bleeding.', '  “It seemed like a problem that a lot of people had,” he said. “I  figured if there’s a big enough problem, then there’s probably a  market there. … Licensing adds a fair amount to the price of  a set, and the expense of the product lent itself to the rental  business.”', 'Netbricks started selling to the public in 2015 and at launch a Groupon promotion led to an initial enroll of 5,000 people, far outpacing expectations. He said that  requests for the now-discontinued Death Star set accounted for  fully 12 percent of his initial customer requests, with the $240  Tower Bridge set taking second place.', '  “These are people who buy at a lower price point,” he said.  “Something like the Death Star is a once-a-year purchase for  these families.”', ' (Pictured: The world-famous Tower Bridge features iconic  towers, working drawbridge and a red double-decker bus.

Netbricks assesses no charge for those.', '  “Part of our service is no charge for normal piece loss,” Weil  said, citing a range of 15 to 20 lost pieces for regular sets or  20 to 30 for larger ones. He added that the company’s real  concern is the malicious actor who “harvests” Lego sets with the  intention of selling rare pieces to desperate builders who need  that special brick to finish their creation.', '  Weil would not disclose his company’s financial information, but  he said that it’s profitable on a gross margin basis, and he  expects it to be cash-flow positive in six months’ time. He added  that he’s in no rush to see the company get ahead of itself by  expanding too quickly.', '  “We made a decision early on that although there’s more demand  out there that we can get, we didn’t want to take on a huge  volume of customers until operations are ready to scale,” he  said. “If you don’t have customer service and structure where you  can field all calls, that’s not a great way to grow a  business.”', '  Netbricks currently boasts 215 “fully active” members, which it  defines as members who have rented and returned sets for more  than one cycle. The current total is well below the 5,000  customers who signed up at launch, but Weil said that was to be  expected because of the one-time impact of the Groupon promotion.  The lower number of repeat customers is a more accurate  reflection of Lego diehards. And Weil said that Netbricks has  been successful in retaining repeat customers, so they must be  doing something right.', '  Netbricks is not allowed to buy Legos from Lego.com, because Lego  is trying to discourage resellers. Netbricks buys its entire  inventory from retailers (Walmart, Target, Toys-R-Us,  etc.). ', '“Lego is aware of what we’re doing and we’ve had a  handful of communications with them,” Weil said. “It was nothing atypical of  how a top five worldwide brand would work to protect their brand  and trademark. Anytime anybody pops up and is using the word ‘Lego’ in a commercial sense, the Lego company sends out  information and notification as to how they would like you to use  their trademarks, and that’s been the extent of our business to  business communication with Lego.”', 'Lego Group could not provide a comment by press time.', '  “We’re focused on providing an experience for big-time Lego  fans.

It was disappointing.” A second email, saying the same thing, followed another unreturned phone call from Block.', 'Wal-Mart did not respond to repeated requests for comment.', 'Block decided on her bottom-line message to Wal-Mart: She wouldn’t work with the company, “not until you let me make money.”', '“I would really like to do business globally with Wal-Mart … but if they’re going to reduce the price on the shelf and use it as a loss leader, that’s bad for my brand,” the EarthKind founder said.', 'Walking away from Wal-Mart and its hundreds of millions of weekly customers would dumbfound many small-business suppliers, but it turned out to be one of the best things Block, at the time, could have done for EarthKind.', 'Stories of Wal-Mart squeezing suppliers are not new — it has, after all, built itself into the world’s largest retailer mainly by offering rock-bottom prices to lure customers, an approach that became even more important when earnings sagged in recent years. The pain that comes from working with it includes difficulty scaling and maintaining business at the level that Wal-Mart demands.', 'Even though Wal-Mart’s leverage in deals is no secret, saying no to Wal-Mart’s business isn’t something most small firms want to do. Landing the behemoth as a buyer of their goods is a dream for many suppliers, as it can swiftly lead to rocketing sales and market share. Wal-Mart’s CEO, Doug McDillon, boasts on the company’s web site, “For our suppliers, working with Wal-Mart means access to the 260 million customers who shop our stores around the world each week.” ', 'More from iCONIC:  Business lessons that fueled Reed Hastings’ 20-year $60 billion Netflix run   A booming start-up center north of the border is rivaling Silicon Valley   Lending gap or not, women are beating out men 5 to 1 in this booming sector', 'Reaching even a small percentage of Wal-Mart shoppers would have been a good step in growth for EarthKind, which has just only started to break into mainstream, big-box retail. Its first customers, whom Block persuaded to try free samples of the solution she came up with by trial and error, were farmers and equipment dealers near her family’s farm in New Town, North Dakota. “Farmers hate getting ripped off. They’re cheap in that respect,” Block said.', 'The idea for the product came to Block during the early 2000s, at a time when she was looking to subsidize her family’s $30,000-a-year farm income. One day while driving her truck, a mouse ran up her leg. After warding it off with perfume, she did some research. She found that 98 percent of the then-$100 million mice-control market was made up of poison-based products. By calling around to farm-supply stories, she also estimated that U.S. farmers lose roughly $8 million a year in farm equipment damage caused by pests.', 'Block handed out the initial samples in the fall of 2002.', '“I was also looking at human behavior. [Farmers] aren’t going to take the time to hang something up or do anything extra; they were tossing in a bag of poison, so they might as well try this pouch,” Block said.', 'By February of the next year, most of the trial clients were happy. “They didn’t have to clean up dead bodies; they didn’t have to worry about poisoning their dogs,” Block said.', 'Sales grew incrementally as EarthKind picked up more equipment dealers including her local John Deere, but then Block hit a roadblock. Her brand had just received some local press, and an Environmental Protection Agency representative sought her out at a tradeshow to tell her that any product being sold to control pests needs a license, a process that could cost up to $2 million.', '″[The rep] recommended that I not go through with it, but I made up my mind — my product had to come out because we just keep killing things, it goes against nature.” Block said. “If I grew to have 2 percent of the market, that’s a good little business.”', 'It took Block about four years of back-and-forth with the EPA and about $200,000 — much of which came from grants, the selling of her beloved pack horse and camper, and income selling produce — to finally get her license. She officially launched EarthKind in 2007, and on the backs of John Deere (her first national account) and a small army of farmers, she was able to work her way into RV and marine dealers. It took three years to get a callback from Menards, the Eau Claire, Wisconsin-based home improvement chain with about 300 stores in the Midwest. Dealing with Menards foreshadowed the experience she’d go through with bigger chains. It wanted a lower price, and it wanted her to change her brown-box packaging to a plastic clamshell.', '“They said, ‘If you manufacture it in China, you’ll get the price down to where you’re going to sell it,’” Block recalled. “That defeats the whole purpose of growing a business using U.S. agricultural products that are environmentally-friendly, too.”', 'Block eventually hooked Menards on another idea, a store locator service technology on EarthKind.com that lets customers see which stores are selling non-poison pest control.', '“I went back into their office and showed that we’ve got 30,000 customers in their area who would buy our product in your store if you had it,” she said. Menards was impressed, and after a heated price negotiation — Block left the room when the buyer wanted a price lower than her walk-away limit — the retailer bit. Today, the retailer is one of EarthKind’s most consistent buyers.', 'IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm, estimates that year-over-year retail sales for the overall pest-control market — which includes chemical products and devices intended to kill insects and rodents — was almost $800 million as of late December 2016, up 5.5 percent from the previous year.', 'Unlike most of the poison-based products, 90 percent of this sector, EarthKind’s are safe to use around food, children and pets. Driven by consumer demand in other industries as well, the all-natural category is growing. Sixty-one percent of pest-control users polled prefer to use natural, non-chemical alternatives, according to a recent Mintel Group research report.', 'This is what eventually led Lowe’s, the world’s second-largest home improvement chain, to strike up a deal with EarthKind two years ago, after meeting Block at a woman business owner-focused tradeshow. Lowe’s had conducted some surveys and found that customers were asking for all-natural options for things like herbicides and pesticides. Lowes was impressed with EarthKind’s history selling to the agricultural industry, and after some trial and error on new packaging and price negotiations, Lowe’s placed EarthKind’s Stay Away in a prime spot in 350 of its stores.', '“Her products do really well,” said Jason Miller, Lowe’s merchandising director for lawn and garden. “We were happy with the accretive sales it has produced; it didn’t steal from the category.” In December, Lowe’s extended its deal with EarthKind to place its products in 1,700 of its stores, a program that will extend into April.', 'The Lowe’s business is indicative of how EarthKind has grown over the past year. Sales to hardware stores and farm/home stores grew 51.5 percent and 44 percent respectively, while new sales to grocery stores and lawn and garden stores grew 695 percent.', 'Lowe’s also illustrates the type of partnership that Block says is integral to growing her firm the way she wants. The back and forth she carries out with such retailers — price negotiations almost always follow each big new order — is typical of what analysts call a good relationship between vendor and buyer. “Key vendor relationships with retailers are very collaborative and not adversarial,” said Charlie O’Shea, a senior analyst at Moody’s who covers large retail. “It may get down to the nitty-gritty on price every so often, but it’s hard for a large retailer to flip a switch and replace a key vendor.”', 'While accepting the deal (sans negotiation) with Wal-Mart would have definitely boosted EarthKind’s revenue, it would have strained the firm on a few different levels. “We didn’t have the infrastructure to support the customer — I didn’t want my people focusing on one customer solely. … Such a big [account] ends up risking the report cards with others,” Block said, who decided early on that no single retailer would make up more than 15 percent of EarthKind’s business. (Lowe’s made up 15 percent of the firm’s sales last year.)', 'Settling on a lower price with Wal-Mart could have also impacted deal-making with everyone else. “All of a sudden my negotiation in that room [with another retailer] becomes much more difficult if they throw the Walmart [price] up,” she said.', 'There was also the fear that Wal-Mart’s lower price may have eroded EarthKind’s profit margins and hindered Block’s growth plan. That plan includes sourcing American-grown raw materials from family farms, manufacturing stateside, keeping a low carbon footprint, and investing in a workforce of which 20 percent is made up of developmentally-disadvantaged workers, who help with packaging. She also provides 100 percent paid health care, vacation packages and bonuses for all employees based on company growth and profitability.', 'While a deal with Wal-Mart won’t happen until Block can facilitate a more involved price debate, she’s slowly ramping up operations so EarthKind can handle other big retail brands — maybe Target and Costco — in the next year or so. In 2015, she moved manufacturing from North Dakota to North Carolina so she could ship product quickly and more cost-effectively to retailers. Last year, she added robotics to the plant floor. She has also hired three executives to fill out her leadership team.', 'One indirect way to finding more big customers — and another possible way into Wal-Mart and Target — is via Burt’s Bees, the all-natural skincare line owned by The Clorox Company that Wal-Mart already sells. EarthKind is an inaugural member of Burt’s Bees Launchpad, an annual grant program that helps start-ups operating in the all-natural health and well-being market. Through the contacts she’s made in the program, Block recently toured the Burt’s Bees factory, where she picked up ideas on how to reward and motivate employees.', 'Block is also mentoring a Burt’s Bees sales planner, who previously ran the firm’s business with Target. “We’ve not been able to get into Target stores — they own the moms and millennials market,” Block said.', 'Meanwhile, Block has no regrets about playing hard-Moneyball with the world’s biggest retailer: “Saying no to Wal-Mart allowed us to make sure we have good execution with our other customers,” she said. “And it doesn’t break their hearts when you say no to their competitors.”', '— Maggie Overfelt, special to CNBC.com ']",100

But when it comes to profitability, an online sale is not an equivalent replacement for that same item purchased in store.', 'Retail consultancy AlixPartners built models for CNBC to illustrate an approximation of the financial differences an apparel retailer might see when selling $100 worth of goods in-store and the same $100 worth of goods online.', 'Buy in-store', 'The AlixPartners models begin with a typical $100 clothing purchase made by a shopper in a physical store, with a typical cost of goods sold — or what the retailer paid to have that clothing manufactured — of about $40.', 'Then, there is the cost of running stores, but because those costs are considered “legacy” costs — and have been in place for many years — there’s a maturity and scale to them, making them more efficient, and less “expensive” relatively, than the cost of running online operations.', 'In a physical retail store, a shopper, effectively, picks out her own merchandise, and gets it home herself, so there’s no additional “picking, packing, shipping” cost paid by a retailer with this model.', 'Thus the $100 outfit has associated operating costs, like rent, overhead and labor of about $28.', 'So a $100 purchase, minus the $40 cost of the goods, minus the $28 operating costs associated with that unit of clothing, leaves a profit margin of 32 percent.', 'Buy online, ship from distribution center', 'Now, consider a shopper instead goes to a retailer’s website to search for and buy that same $100 outfit, with the same $40 cost. The model assumes that the $100 purchase comes with free shipping, which is fairly typical for a purchase of that value.', 'There are costs associated with processing an online order. In this case, it has to be picked, packed and shipped to the shopper from a distribution center.', 'It’s much more expensive on a per item basis, for a retailer to ship individual orders, one at a time, from fulfillment centers to consumers’ homes, than it is to send a truckload of inventory from a distribution center to a store.', 'So, for the retailer, the clothing shipped from a distribution center would have associated operating costs of $30, slightly more than the in-store operating costs.', 'The higher operating costs in this model result from distribution costs that can be four times higher, and overhead and infrastructure costs that can be three times more than an in-store model.', '“Overhead and infrastructure cost is where strategy comes into play,” explained Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners. “A retailer has to make decisions. Do I own my [distribution center]? Do I pay a third party to do it for me? The cost for certain corporate functions, associated with running distribution centers like IT and marketing, can be in the tens of millions of dollars in terms of investment.”', 'There’s also the investment to build and manage websites, apps, distribution centers, and establish shipping networks or partnerships to fulfill those orders.', 'Online operations also have other incremental costs when it comes to acquiring and then taking care of customers, Madden said. A retailer needs systems to help shoppers with order management and tracking, and to show them where inventory may be available (i.e., online only, or available in certain stores). Plus there’s a cost to manage the complexity of the “endless aisle” online, logistics and IT coordination with shipping vendors like FedEx and UPS, and increased marketing spending for search engine optimization to drive shoppers to their websites.', '“All these costs,” said Madden, “until they slow and until online grows into a larger share of business, will continue to outpace any similar costs for legacy stores.”', 'Which means, all of it together makes a retailer’s online business much more like a start-up, with less scale leading to higher costs and lower profitability, compared to its legacy store networks.', 'Put it altogether, and AlixPartners models that the same outfit purchase made online and shipped to a consumer has a profitability breakdown as follows: $100 purchase price, minus the $40 cost of the goods, minus the $30 operating costs associated with that unit of clothing, leaving a profit margin of 30 percent.', 'Buy online, pick-up in store', 'Now that many retailers can serve shoppers both in-store and online, there are increasing instances of consumers looking for the convenience of ordering merchandise online, but picking it up in-store. In some cases, it may be faster or even more convenient for shoppers to pick-up in store, than waiting for home package delivery.', 'But, offering a “buy online pickup in store” option, means a retailer is paying to operate both channels. So when breaking down the operating cost to fulfill that order, you have to account for all the aforementioned operating costs of running both channels.', 'So that same $100 outfit that cost the retailer $40 to buy, now comes with associated operating costs of $37 dollars spread over both the store and web operations, leaving an operating a profit margin of 23 percent.', 'Buy online, ship from store', 'Leveraging stores as distribution centers sounds like an efficient, lower cost option. But it’s not.', 'It’s true that in many cases, stores are considerably closer, geographically, to shoppers than distribution centers, which are often located in less populated areas.', 'But, using stores as distribution centers is the least profitable model.', 'The main reason for the compressed profitability is the cost of double-shipping merchandise.', 'But the retailer would do this if it means keeping a shopper happy by getting that shopper merchandise faster.', 'As a retailer, you are operating two channels, and shipping that merchandise twice, to fulfill an order placed online but shipped to a consumer from a store. Generally, store merchandise gets there by the semi-truckload, so a retailer has paid for that distribution cost once.', 'Then, if an order placed online is fulfilled from store merchandise, employees at the store have to pick, pack, and ship individual orders to a shopper’s home.', 'Not only has that same outfit now shipped twice, at the retailer’s expense, but the “last mile” or the final leg of the delivery journey is far by the most expensive.', 'So back to our example. The $100 outfit, with a $40 cost, now has associated operating costs of $48 when ordered online but shipped from a store, leaving a profit margin of 12 percent, a full 20 percentage points lower than a pure in-store sale.', 'The cost of returns', 'AlixPartners explains that the cost of returns is not discussed in the models as it’s very difficult to factor in numerically, but it is critical to understand, as it’s especially costly for online purchases.', 'Clothing items bought online are returned three times more than items bought in-store on average. But processing those online returns can be six times more expensive compared to in-store.', 'Industry standard suggests 30 to 40 percent of all clothing bought online ultimately gets returned. This makes sense given it’s very hard to know how clothing will fit and feel without seeing it in person first. Plus, consider that many consumers may order the same clothing item in several sizes or colors online, only ever intending to keep one.', 'So, if the items are shipped for free to the shopper, and returned at no cost to the shopper, that leaves the retailer absorbing shipping costs both ways on up to 40 percent of all clothing items bought online.', 'But stores do offer a higher chance to recapture some profit.', 'If a retailer has a store network, like in our model examples, many consumers will choose to return in-store and then there’s a much higher chance the consumer will buy something else on that trip. Target says one-third of shoppers that pickup online orders in store buy something else.', 'An in-store return can lower the cost somewhat, since return shipping may not be paid by the retailer if the item stays in store and can be resold.', 'But, there is a cost to re-process the item, and it may end up being shipped back to a distribution center, but this time in bulk with other items. In other cases, it’s a lost sale entirely and the item counts as a loss, along with all the other returned goods that can’t be resold.', 'Making online less expensive ', 'Most retail experts think that both stores and online options give retailers the best chance for success to optimize the shopping experience. The big question is what percent of sales should come from each channel to achieve maximum profitability, and when will the industry hit that equilibrium.', 'There are a number of actions retailers can take to increase their online profit margins including growing the size of the online sales channel to scale the overhead and the investments, Madden said. Additionally, retailers should look for ways to lower shipping, or consider upping free shipping minimums. Figuring out how to lower return frequency is a big cost saver, as is encouraging shoppers to bring their online returns into stores for hopes of picking up additional sales.', 'Testing the model: J.C. Penney’s experience ', 'While the AlixPartners models will approximate the cost many apparel retailers are facing across channels, the profit margin of course will vary from retailer to retailer depending on many factors, decisions, investments and capabilities.', 'J.C. Penney said its profitability order is a little different, with in-store being the most profitable. The order online, pick up in-store option is the second most profitable, followed by order online, ship from distribution center, and lastly order online, ship from store.', 'On its fourth-quarter earnings call, J.C. Penney CEO Marvin Ellison said 77 percent of online purchases touched the store in 2016. Ellison further explained to CNBC “every time an online order touches the store, it actually helps the margin. The real pain point is the fulfillment price, it’s always cheaper to ship from a distribution facility to a store than to a consumer.”', 'So for the department store, there are two reasons the order online, pick up in store option is the second most profitable method.', 'First, J.C. Penney says when an online order is picked up in store, at least one-third of those customers will make an additional purchase in store of about $50. (Incremental sales were not captured in the AlixPartners models.)', 'Second, the same-day pick up feature uses inventory already in the store, so no shipping to store is necessary. But, the department store’s “free ship to store” feature — which takes four to seven business days and is offered free for orders over $25 — is done using Penney’s weekly delivery trucks to lower that shipping cost. Because its stores are replenished with new merchandise each week, it’s cost-effective to load that same truck with jcp.com orders that customers have chosen to pick-up in that store.', 'J.C. Penney spokeswoman Daphne Avila said that even though it’s least profitable to fulfill an online order by shipping from the store, it’s “still more advantageous to ‘save the sale’ and not disappoint a customer. In the past, we lost the sale if our distribution center couldn’t have the item in stock. Now we’re developing an enterprise-wide view of our inventory so we can better meet customer demand.”', 'Watch: Wal-Mart in talks to acquire Bonobos']",100

But maybe you’re still not sure which candidate you’ll vote for – or whether you’ll vote at all. Maybe you’re tired of the direction we’re headed, but you can’t see a better path yet, or you just don’t know enough about the person who wants to lead us there.', '“So let me tell you about my friend Joe Biden. ', '“Twelve years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I didn’t know I’d end up finding a brother. Joe and I came from different places and different generations. But what I quickly came to admire about him is his resilience, born of too much struggle; his empathy, born of too much grief. Joe’s a man who learned – early on – to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity, living by the words his parents taught him: “No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody.”', '“That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts – that’s who Joe is.', '“When he talks with someone who’s lost her job, Joe remembers the night his father sat him down to say that he’d lost his. When Joe listens to a parent who’s trying to hold it all together right now, he does it as the single dad who took the train back to Wilmington each and every night so he could tuck his kids into bed. When he meets with military families who’ve lost their hero, he does it as a kindred spirit; the parent of an American soldier; somebody whose faith has endured the hardest loss there is.', '“For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president – and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country.', '“And in my friend Kamala Harris, he’s chosen an ideal partner who’s more than prepared for the job; someone who knows what it’s like to overcome barriers and who’s made a career fighting to help others live out their own American dream.', '“Along with the experience needed to get things done, Joe and Kamala have concrete policies that will turn their vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality.', '“They’ll get this pandemic under control, like Joe did when he helped me manage H1N1 and prevent an Ebola outbreak from reaching our shores. They’ll expand health care to more Americans, like Joe and I did 10 years ago when he helped craft the Affordable Care Act and nail down the votes to make it the law. They’ll rescue the economy, like Joe helped me do after the Great Recession. I asked him to manage the Recovery Act, which jump-started the longest stretch of job growth in history.', '“And he sees this moment now not as a chance to get back to where we were, but to make long-overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody – whether it’s the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own, or the shift worker always on the edge of getting laid off, or the student figuring out how to pay for next semester’s classes.', '“Joe and Kamala will restore our standing in the world – and as we’ve learned from this pandemic, that matters. Joe knows the world, and the world knows him. He knows that our true strength comes from setting an example the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators. A nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change, terrorism, poverty, and disease.', '“But more than anything, what I know about Joe and Kamala is that they actually care about every American. And they care deeply about this democracy.', '“They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballot, not harder. They believe that no one – including the president – is above the law, and that no public official – including the president – should use their office to enrich themselves or their supporters.', '“They understand that in this democracy, the commander-in-chief doesn’t use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. They understand that political opponents aren’t “un-American” just because they disagree with you; that a free press isn’t the ‘enemy’ but the way we hold officials accountable; that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up.', '“None of this should be controversial. These shouldn’t be Republican principles or Democratic principles. They are American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him, have shown they don’t believe in these things.', '“Tonight, I am asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better. But here’s the thing: No single American can fix this country alone. Not even a president. Democracy was never meant to be transactional – you give me your vote; I make everything better. It requires an active and informed citizenry. So I am also asking you to believe in your own ability – to embrace your own responsibility as citizens – to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure.', '“Because that’s what at stake right now. Our democracy.', '“Look, I understand why a lot of Americans are down on government. The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easier for special interests to stop progress than to make progress. Believe me, I know. I understand why a White factory worker who’s seen his wages cut or his job shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him, and why a Black mom might feel like it never looked out for her at all. I understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether there’s still a place for him here; why a young person might look at politics right now, the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies and conspiracy theories and think, what’s the point?', '“Well, here’s the point: this president and those in power – those who benefit from keeping things the way they are – they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn’t matter. That’s how they win. That’s how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life, and the lives of the people you love. That’s how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well-connected, how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks. That’s how a democracy withers, until it’s no democracy at all.', '“And we cannot let that happen. Do not let them take away your power. Do not let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you’re going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote too. Do what Americans have done for over two centuries when faced with even tougher times than this – all those quiet heroes who found the courage to keep marching, keep pushing in the face of hardship and injustice.', '“Last month, we lost a giant of American democracy in John Lewis. Some years ago, I sat down with John and the few remaining leaders of the early civil rights movement. One of them told me he never imagined he’d walk into the White House and see a president who looked like his grandson. Then he told me that he’d looked it up, and it turned out that on the very day that I was born, he was marching into a jail cell, trying to end Jim Crow segregation in the South.', '“What we do echoes through the generations.', '“Whatever our backgrounds, we’re all the children of Americans who fought the good fight. Great grandparents working in firetraps and sweatshops without rights or representation. Farmers losing their dreams to dust. Irish and Italians and Asians and Latinos told to go back where you came from. Jews and Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs, made to feel suspect for the way they worshipped. Black Americans chained and whipped and hanged. Spit on for trying to sit at lunch counters. Beaten for trying to vote.', '“If anyone had a right to believe that this democracy did not work, and could not work, it was those Americans. Our ancestors. They were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives. They knew how far the daily reality of America strayed from the myth. And yet, instead of giving up, they joined together and said somehow, some way, we are going to make this work. We are going to bring those words, in our founding documents, to life.', '“I’ve seen that same spirit rising these past few years. Folks of every age and background who packed city centers and airports and rural roads so that families wouldn’t be separated. So that another classroom wouldn’t get shot up. So that our kids won’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. Americans of all races joining together to declare, in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state, that Black lives matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism.', '“To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better – in so many ways, you are this country’s dreams fulfilled. Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you, it’s a given – a conviction. And what I want you to know is that for all its messiness and frustrations, your system of self-government can be harnessed to help you realize those convictions.', '“You can give our democracy new meaning. You can take it to a better place. You’re the missing ingredient – the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creed.', '“That work will continue long after this election. But any chance of success depends entirely on the outcome of this election. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes for them to win. So we have to get busy building it up – by pouring all our efforts into these 76 days, and by voting like never before – for Joe and Kamala, and candidates up and down the ticket, so that we leave no doubt about what this country we love stands for – today and for all our days to come.', '“Stay safe.

As part of that announcement, Amazon said it hopes to begin testing all of its employees, including those who show no symptoms.', '“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running,” Bezos said. “For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available.”', 'Bezos detailed other steps Amazon has taken to curb the coronavirus, such as providing employees with face masks and distributing temperature checks for warehouse workers, delivery drivers and Whole Foods employees. He added that Amazon temporarily closed some of its physical stores, including Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star and Amazon Pop Up stores as they don’t sell essential products, and offered those store employees roles in other parts of the company.', 'Despite the new safety measures, Amazon workers from at least three facilities have staged protests to call for the company to close facilities where there are positive cases of the virus. A dozen workers told CNBC they felt Amazon needed to provide employees with paid time off, among other concerns.', 'Amazon’s logistics and delivery systems have been under some strain since the pandemic worsened across the globe. Due to a surge in online orders, the company was forced to prioritize shipments of essential goods at its fulfillment centers, resulting in longer delivery times and a rare disruption to its typical two-day and one-day delivery windows.', 'Bezos said unlike the typical holiday shopping season, the surge over the last few months “occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and delivery network.” For that reason and others, Bezos added that his “own time and thinking” continues to be focused on the coronavirus.', '“I am extremely grateful to my fellow Amazonians for all the grit and ingenuity they are showing as we move through this,” Bezos said. “You can count on all of us to look beyond the immediate crisis for insights and lessons and how to apply them going forward.”', 'Amazon had 798,000 full-time and part-time employees as of Dec. 31 and has hired more than 100,000 new employees since March to deal with coronavirus demands and plans to add 75,000 more jobs.', 'You can read the letter in full below:', 'To our shareowners:', 'One thing we’ve learned from the COVID-19 crisis is how important Amazon has become to our customers. We want you to know we take this responsibility seriously, and we’re proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.', 'Amazonians are working around the clock to get necessary supplies delivered directly to the doorsteps of people who need them. The demand we are seeing for essential products has been and remains high. But unlike a predictable holiday surge, this spike occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and delivery network. We quickly prioritized the stocking and delivery of essential household staples, medical supplies, and other critical products.', 'Our Whole Foods Market stores have remained open, providing fresh food and other vital goods for customers. We are taking steps to help those most vulnerable to the virus, setting aside the first hour of shopping at Whole Foods each day for seniors. We have temporarily closed Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Up stores because they don’t sell essential products, and we offered associates from those closed stores the opportunity to continue working in other parts of Amazon.', 'Crucially, while providing these essential services, we are focused on the safety of our employees and contractors around the world—we are deeply grateful for their heroic work and are committed to their health and well-being. Consulting closely with medical experts and health authorities, we’ve made over 150 significant process changes in our operations network and Whole Foods Market stores to help teams stay healthy, and we conduct daily audits of the measures we’ve put into place. We’ve distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks at sites around the world to help protect employees and support staff. We regularly sanitize door handles, stairway handrails, lockers, elevator buttons, and touch screens, and disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are standard across our network.', 'We’ve also introduced extensive social distancing measures to help protect our associates. We have eliminated stand-up meetings during shifts, moved information sharing to bulletin boards, staggered break times, and spread out chairs in breakrooms. While training new hires is challenging with new distancing requirements, we continue to ensure that every new employee gets six hours of safety training. We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’t have employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.', 'A next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no symptoms. Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available. If every person could be tested regularly, it would make a huge difference in how we fight this virus. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could re-enter the economy with confidence.', 'We’ve begun the work of building incremental testing capacity. A team of Amazonians—from research scientists and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers—moved from their normal day jobs onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our frontline employees soon. We are not sure how far we will get in the relevant timeframe, but we think it’s worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn.', 'While we explore longer-term solutions, we are also committed to helping support employees now. We increased our minimum wage through the end of April by $2 per hour in the U.S., $2 per hour in Canada, £2 per hour in the UK, and €2 per hour in many European countries. And we are paying associates double our regular rate for any overtime worked—a minimum of $34 an hour—an increase from time and a half. These wage increases will cost more than $500 million, just through the end of April, and likely more than that over time. While we recognize this is expensive, we believe it’s the right thing to do under the circumstances. We also established the Amazon Relief Fund—with an initial $25 million in funding—to support our independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and temporary employees under financial distress.', 'In March, we opened 100,000 new positions across our fulfillment and delivery network. Earlier this week, after successfully filling those roles, we announced we were creating another 75,000 jobs to respond to customer demand. These new hires are helping customers who depend on us to meet their critical needs. We know that many people around the world have suffered financially as jobs are lost or furloughed. We are happy to have them on our teams until things return to normal and either their former employer can bring them back or new jobs become available. We’ve welcomed Joe Duffy, who joined after losing his job as a mechanic at Newark airport and learned about an opening from a friend who is an Amazon operations analyst. Dallas preschool teacher Darby Griffin joined after her school closed on March 9th and now helps manage new inventory. We’re happy to have Darby with us until she can return to the classroom.', 'Amazon is acting aggressively to protect our customers from bad actors looking to exploit the crisis. We’ve removed over half a million offers from our stores due to COVID-based price gouging, and we’ve suspended more than 6,000 selling accounts globally for violating our fair-pricing policies. Amazon turned over information about sellers we suspect engaged in price gouging of products related to COVID-19 to 42 state attorneys general offices. To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel for state attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us.', 'Amazon Web Services is also playing an important role in this crisis. The ability for organizations to access scalable, dependable, and highly secure computing power—whether for vital healthcare work, to help students continue learning, or to keep unprecedented numbers of employees online and productive from home—is critical in this situation. Hospital networks, pharmaceutical companies, and research labs are using AWS to care for patients, explore treatments, and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in many other ways. Academic institutions around the world are transitioning from in-person to virtual classrooms and are running on AWS to help ensure continuity of learning. And governments are leveraging AWS as a secure platform to build out new capabilities in their efforts to end this pandemic.', 'We are collaborating with the World Health Organization, supplying advanced cloud technologies and technical expertise to track the virus, understand the outbreak, and better contain its spread. WHO is leveraging our cloud to build large-scale data lakes, aggregate epidemiological country data, rapidly translate medical training videos into different languages, and help global healthcare workers better treat patients. We are separately making a public AWS COVID-19 data lake available as a centralized repository for up-to-date and curated information related to the spread and characteristics of the virus and its associated illness so experts can access and analyze the latest data in their battle against the disease.', 'We also launched the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, a program to support customers working to bring more accurate diagnostic solutions to market for COVID-19. Better diagnostics help accelerate treatment and containment of this pandemic. We committed $20 million to accelerate this work and help our customers harness the cloud to tackle this challenge. While the program was established in response to COVID-19, we also are looking toward the future, and we will fund diagnostic research projects that have the potential to blunt future infectious disease outbreaks.', 'Customers around the world have leveraged the cloud to scale up services and stand up responses to COVID-19. We joined the New York City COVID-19 Rapid Response Coalition to develop a conversational agent to enable at-risk and elderly New Yorkers to receive accurate, timely information about medical and other important needs. In response to a request from the Los Angeles Unified School District to transition 700,000 students to remote learning, AWS helped establish a call center to field IT questions, provide remote support, and enable staff to answer calls. We are providing cloud services to the CDC to help thousands of public health practitioners and clinicians gather data related to COVID-19 and inform response efforts. In the UK, AWS provides the cloud computing infrastructure for a project that analyzes hospital occupancy levels, emergency room capacity, and patient wait times to help the country’s National Health Service decide where best to allocate resources. In Canada, OTN—one of the world’s largest virtual care networks—is scaling its AWS-powered video service to accommodate a 4,000% spike in demand to support citizens as the pandemic continues. In Brazil, AWS will provide the São Paulo State Government with cloud computing infrastructure to guarantee online classes to 1 million students in public schools across the state.', 'Following CDC guidance, our Alexa health team built an experience that lets U.S. customers check their risk level for COVID-19 at home. Customers can ask, “Alexa, what do I do if I think I have COVID-19?” or “Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus?” Alexa then asks a series of questions about the person’s symptoms and possible exposure. Based on those responses, Alexa then provides CDC-sourced guidance. We created a similar service in Japan, based on guidance from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.', 'We’re making it easy for customers to use Amazon.com or Alexa to donate directly to charities on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, including Feeding America, the American Red Cross, and Save the Children. Echo users have the option to say, “Alexa, make a donation to Feeding America COVID-19 Response Fund.” In Seattle, we’ve partnered with a catering business to distribute 73,000 meals to 2,700 elderly and medically vulnerable residents in Seattle and King County during the outbreak, and we donated 8,200 laptops to help Seattle Public Schools students gain access to a device while classes are conducted virtually.', 'Although these are incredibly difficult times, they are an important reminder that what we do as a company can make a big difference in people’s lives. Customers count on us to be there, and we are fortunate to be able to help. With our scale and ability to innovate quickly, Amazon can make a positive impact and be an organizing force for progress.', 'Last year, we co-founded The Climate Pledge with Christiana Figueres, the UN’s former climate change chief and founder of Global Optimism, and became the first signatory to the pledge. The pledge commits Amazon to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early—and be net zero carbon by 2040. Amazon faces significant challenges in achieving this goal because we don’t just move information around—we have extensive physical infrastructure and deliver more than 10 billion items worldwide a year. And we believe if Amazon can get to net zero carbon ten years early, any company can—and we want to work together with all companies to make it a reality.', 'To that end, we are recruiting other companies to sign The Climate Pledge. Signatories agree to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions regularly, implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement, and achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040. (We’ll be announcing new signatories soon.)', 'We plan to meet the pledge, in part, by purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian—a Michigan-based producer of electric vehicles. Amazon aims to have 10,000 of Rivian’s new electric vans on the road as early as 2022, and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. That’s good for the environment, but the promise is even greater. This type of investment sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy.', 'We’ve also committed to reaching 80% renewable energy by 2024 and 100% renewable energy by 2030. (The team is actually pushing to get to 100% by 2025 and has a challenging but credible plan to pull that off.) Globally, Amazon has 86 solar and wind projects that have the capacity to generate over 2,300 MW and deliver more than 6.3 million MWh of energy annually—enough to power more than 580,000 U.S. homes.', 'We’ve made tremendous progress cutting packaging waste. More than a decade ago, we created the Frustration-Free Packaging program to encourage manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open, 100% recyclable packaging that is ready to ship to customers without the need for an additional shipping box. Since 2008, this program has saved more than 810,000 tons of packaging material and eliminated the use of 1.4 billion shipping boxes.', 'We are making these significant investments to drive our carbon footprint to zero despite the fact that shopping online is already inherently more carbon efficient than going to the store. Amazon’s sustainability scientists have spent more than three years developing the models, tools, and metrics to measure our carbon footprint. Their detailed analysis has found that shopping online consistently generates less carbon than driving to a store, since a single delivery van trip can take approximately 100 roundtrip car journeys off the road on average. Our scientists developed a model to compare the carbon intensity of ordering Whole Foods Market groceries online versus driving to your nearest Whole Foods Market store. The study found that, averaged across all basket sizes, online grocery deliveries generate 43% lower carbon emissions per item compared to shopping in stores. Smaller basket sizes generate even greater carbon savings.', 'AWS is also inherently more efficient than the traditional in-house data center. That’s primarily due to two things—higher utilization, and the fact that our servers and facilities are more efficient than what most companies can achieve running their own data centers. Typical single-company data centers operate at roughly 18% server utilization. They need that excess capacity to handle large usage spikes. AWS benefits from multi-tenant usage patterns and operates at far higher server utilization rates. In addition, AWS has been successful in increasing the energy efficiency of its facilities and equipment, for instance by using more efficient evaporative cooling in certain data centers instead of traditional air conditioning. A study by 451 Research found that AWS’s infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median U.S. enterprise data center surveyed. Along with our use of renewable energy, these factors enable AWS to do the same tasks as traditional data centers with an 88% lower carbon footprint. And don’t think we’re not going to get those last 12 points—we’ll make AWS 100% carbon free through more investments in renewable energy projects.', 'Over the last decade, no company has created more jobs than Amazon. Amazon directly employs 840,000 workers worldwide, including over 590,000 in the U.S., 115,000 in Europe, and 95,000 in Asia. In total, Amazon directly and indirectly supports 2 million jobs in the U.S., including 680,000-plus jobs created by Amazon’s investments in areas like construction, logistics, and professional services, plus another 830,000 jobs created by small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon. Globally, we support nearly 4 million jobs. We are especially proud of the fact that many of these are entry-level jobs that give people their first opportunity to participate in the workforce.', 'And Amazon’s jobs come with an industry-leading $15 minimum wage and comprehensive benefits. More than 40 million Americans—many making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour—earn less than the lowest-paid Amazon associate. When we raised our starting minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2018, it had an immediate and meaningful impact on the hundreds of thousands of people working in our fulfillment centers. We want other big employers to join us by raising their own minimum pay rates, and we continue to lobby for a $15 federal minimum wage.', 'We want to improve workers’ lives beyond pay. Amazon provides every full-time employee with health insurance, a 401(k) plan, 20 weeks paid maternity leave, and other benefits. These are the same benefits that Amazon’s most senior executives receive. And with our rapidly changing economy, we see more clearly than ever the need for workers to evolve their skills continually to keep up with technology. That’s why we’re spending $700 million to provide more than 100,000 Amazonians access to training programs, at their places of work, in high-demand fields such as healthcare, cloud computing, and machine learning. Since 2012, we have offered Career Choice, a pre-paid tuition program for fulfillment center associates looking to move into high- demand occupations. Amazon pays up to 95% of tuition and fees toward a certificate or diploma in qualified fields of study, leading to enhanced employment opportunities in high-demand jobs. Since its launch, more than 25,000 Amazonians have received training for in-demand occupations.', 'To ensure that future generations have the skills they need to thrive in a technology-driven economy, we started a program last year called Amazon Future Engineer, which is designed to educate and train low-income and disadvantaged young people to pursue careers in computer science. We have an ambitious goal: to help hundreds of thousands of students each year learn computer science and coding. Amazon Future Engineer currently funds Introduction to Computer Science and AP Computer Science classes for more than 2,000 schools in underserved communities across the country. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer also gives 100 four-year, $40,000 college scholarships to computer science students from low-income backgrounds. Those scholarship recipients also receive guaranteed, paid internships at Amazon after their first year of college. Our program in the UK funds 120 engineering apprenticeships and helps students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue technology careers.', 'For now, my own time and thinking continues to be focused on COVID-19 and how Amazon can help while we’re in the middle of it. I am extremely grateful to my fellow Amazonians for all the grit and ingenuity they are showing as we move through this. You can count on all of us to look beyond the immediate crisis for insights and lessons and how to apply them going forward.', 'Reflect on this from Theodor Seuss Geisel:', '“When something bad happens you have three choices.

The 30-hour Black Friday-like sales event is marketed to Prime members, meaning the millions of projected shipments destined for doorsteps will have two days or less to get there.', 'Enter Prime Air — the air cargo service Amazon officially introduced last summer.', '“These planes are predominantly focused on our two-day network,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations and customer service, a role that includes oversight of the supply chain and transportation network. “What it does is it allows us to make the [shipping] cut-off later, so you can order later and later and still get that in the two-day promise with our own air network.” ', 'Standing in front a Boeing 767 fitted for freight and emblazoned in blue and white branding including the Prime swish logo, Clark said the fleet of 24 planes allows Amazon to fly to cargo hubs, but also from “point to point.” Sixteen planes will be added by mid-2018.', 'Traditional cargo flights typically involve hub stops; flying point to point means flying direct to a final distribution area from where a shipment will depart on a vehicle on the so-called last mile of delivery to a residence.', 'Clark estimated that the direct option can shave 12 to 15 hours off of a cross-country journey — a crucial reduction when the turnaround is a tight 48 hours or less.', 'The planes are evenly leased out by and operated by two cargo airlines: Air Transport Services Group and Atlas Air Worldwide. Since announcing their deals with the e-commerce giant last year, the two lessors have seen their stocks soar. Shares of both jumped more than 2 percent apiece on Monday ahead of Prime Day, as well.', 'For now Clark is not commenting on whether Amazon will expand its fleet beyond the 40 767s already contracted. It does have warrants to buy at least a 20 percent share of each company over the next several years, and it is investing $1.5 billion into an air cargo hub at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky Airport, where package carrier DHL has operations.', 'But the shipping strategy stretches far beyond jetliners. Amazon has been plowing billions of dollars into steadily building its own transportation and logistics network — one that included 5,000 branded semi trailers hauled by contracted truckers, container shipping for Asian sellers importing goods to be sold through the Amazon platform, tens of millions of square feet of automated warehouse space, apps for last-mile and middle-mile delivery services, and of course eventually drones (which also falls under the Prime Air umbrella).  The investments have stirred questions in the shipping industry and on Wall Street: Is Amazon really looking to move all of its shipments in-house? Is it looking to eventually compete against the carriers like United Parcel Service and FedEx, which it currently relies upon? Or is this simply a necessary move to be able to keep pace with the aggressive growth of Prime membership?', '“There are really two reasons we do this. First and foremost, I think it’s innovation for customers. So whether it be planes enabling us to do later cut-offs for two-day deliveries, or ‘flex’ — which enables us to do one-hour delivery and things like our Prime Now business — creating new delivery services for customers is a big deal for us,” Clark said from the tarmac at Sea-Tac Airport, a 20-minute drive from Amazon headquarters in downtown Seattle. “Second is supplying incremental capacity to support the growth in Prime customers.”', 'In other words, Amazon is not looking to directly compete with its current shipping partners. At least, not yet.', 'Rather, it’s building out capacity because it needs it, beyond the long-term contracts with UPS, FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service, and others. It’s something all involved have been asserting for years in interviews  and on earnings calls, as e-commerce growth continues to outpace capacity and the pace at which shippers have been able to expand their networks  to better meet that demand.', 'Some analysts surmise the major carriers don’t make much money on that business anyway since the sheer scale of the Amazon operation has enabled it to negotiate rock-bottom shipping rates that translate into razor-thin margins for the companies involved.', 'Additionally, many are skeptical Amazon could successfully get into the game of transporting goods for other shippers since so many are retailers and consumer-oriented businesses that now view the tech behemoth as a serious threat.', 'For Amazon, bringing more transportation capabilities in-house could help rein in ballooning shipping costs — a metric it only just recently began breaking out in quarterly earnings.
