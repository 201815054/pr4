While he wrote extensively about challenges facing the country, including economic inequality and political dysfunction, that letter broadcast his belief that the U.S. was in the midst of a boom that could “easily” run into 2023.', 'Now, however, the outbreak of the biggest European conflict since World War II has changed things, roiling markets, realigning alliances and restructuring global trade patterns, he wrote. That introduces both risks and opportunities for the U.S. and other democracies, according to Dimon.', '“The war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia, at a minimum, will slow the global economy — and it could easily get worse,” Dimon wrote. That’s because of the uncertainty about how the conflict will conclude and its impact on supply chains, especially for those involving energy supplies.', 'Dimon added that for JPMorgan, management isn’t worried about its direct exposure to Russia, though the bank could “still lose about $1 billion over time.”', 'Here are excerpts from Dimon’s letter.', '“We expect the fallout from the war and resulting sanctions to reduce Russia’s GDP by 12.5% by midyear (a decline worse than the 10% drop after the 1998 default). Our economists currently think that the euro area, highly dependent on Russia for oil and gas, will see GDP growth of roughly 2% in 2022, instead of the elevated 4.5% pace we had expected just six weeks ago. By contrast, they expect the U.S. economy to advance roughly 2.5% versus a previously estimated 3%. But I caution that these estimates are based upon a fairly static view of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions now in place.”', '“Many more sanctions could be added — which could dramatically, and unpredictably, increase their effect. Along with the unpredictability of war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global commodity supply chains, this makes for a potentially explosive situation. I speak later about the precarious nature of the global energy supply, but for now, simply, that supply is easy to disrupt.”', '“America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. … We must look at this as a wake-up call. We need to pursue short-term and long-term strategies with the goal of not only solving the current crisis but also maintaining the long-term unity of the newly strengthened democratic alliances. We need to make this a permanent, long-lasting stand for democratic ideals and against all forms of evil.”', '“Russian aggression is having another dramatic and important result: It is coalescing the democratic, Western world — across Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries to Australia, Japan and Korea. […] The outcome of these two issues will transcend Russia and likely will affect geopolitics for decades, potentially leading to both a realignment of alliances and a restructuring of global trade.  How the West comports itself, and whether the West can maintain its unity, will likely determine the future global order and shape America’s (and its allies’) important relationship with China.”', '“It also is clear that trade and supply chains, where they affect matters of national security, need to be restructured. You simply cannot rely on countries with different strategic interests for critical goods and services. Such reorganization does not need to be a disaster or decoupling.

The Invesco QQQ ETF has fallen sharply year-to-date but one tech investor is braving the turbulence.  ', 'Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi recently launched a new strategy within Tudor Investment Corp. called T++ with a specific focus on technology stocks. She sat down with Delivering Alpha to discuss her current hedging strategy along with where she’s finding alpha in the technology sector.', '(The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)', 'Leslie Picker: What’s it like being a tech investor right now, given this whole regime change that’s really gone on in the market?', 'Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi: We have this exciting step of a next generation of digital transformation, one that is fueled by data. We predict that data is going to grow more than 100 times over the next 10 years. And this gives rise to tremendous investing opportunities in data infrastructure, in semiconductors, but also in digital and data-first businesses. So lots to be excited about. And then to the second part of your question, what is going on right now? It’s less to do with the prospects of these new technologies but the fact that we have come up with unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus. And that has led to inflationary pressures in our economy that now the Fed seeks to rein in with higher rates. ', 'And so with that backdrop, everything else being equal, this means low equity valuations. So we are discounting future cash flows with higher discount rates. But I think one thing that’s important to recognize is that this tide of fiscal and monetary stimulus has lifted all boats, not just technology. And it’s interesting to see what is still floating when this tide recedes. And here’s who I still see standing: those companies with stronger secular tailwinds, the best business models, and world class leadership. And I think it’s hard to find another sector that has so much of all of these. So maybe another way to put it is that the Fed can change the discount rate, but not a digital inflection of our economy.', 'Picker: As you see these valuations come down pretty sharply, at least in the near term, does that concern you? Are you seeing that as more of a buying opportunity?', 'Hoffmann-Burchardi: If you actually look at these sharp asset price corrections that we have seen, you can look at them and try to invert what these different asset classes price in, in terms of future rate hikes. And so if you look at high-growth software in particular, this now prices in a one percent increase in the 10-year rate, whereas if you look at the Dow Jones, it is still at a zero percent rate hike. So it does look like there’s at least some diversity of risk being priced in. And it sounds like right now, maybe the sharp corrections in high-growth software have, at least in the short term, more to do with positioning and flows than actual fundamentals.', 'Picker: Paul Tudor Jones of your firm recently said that the things that have performed the best since March 2020, are probably going to perform the worst as we go through this tightening cycle. By and large, that’s been high-growth technology where you spend the most of your time and look into these areas. So do you agree with that? And does that kind of concern you on the long side?', 'Hoffmann-Burchardi: We have to prepare ourselves for an environment with higher rates. And as you mentioned, those stocks that have cash flows that are further out into the future are more vulnerable than the ones with near-term cash flows. So with that backdrop, you have to adjust your playbook. And I do think in technology and equity investing in particular, there are still opportunities to make profitable investments in individual companies. Even if valuations are coming down, if companies outperform their growth rates, they can offset that multiple compression. And there’s particular companies that are indexed to the amount of data growth. It’s not that data is going to stop growing, just because the Fed stops growing its balance sheet. ', 'And then secondly, as I just alluded to, there could be tactical opportunities when certain asset classes overreact in the short term. And then lastly, the data also shows that it’s actually sharp increases in rates that are more harmful to equities than higher rates overall. So now that we are pricing in four rate hikes this year, at least the pace of increases in interest rates should start to slow down for the rest of the year. So I would summarize that there’s still two opportunities to deliver Alpha: one is stock selection and then the second one is technically adjusting your hedges when things over or underreact in the short term.', 'Picker: So given that backdrop that you described, what does that mean about whether technology is currently sitting at its fundamental basis? And does that give you more confidence to be a buyer in this market?', 'Hoffmann-Burchardi: As fundamental investors with a long term horizon our first premise is to stay invested in the companies that we believe are going to be the winners of this age of data and digital. So it’s all about hedging. And, you know, hedge funds tend to get a bad rap because they’re so short term-focused. But in fact, hedging can allow you to have staying power in your investments for the long term. And so in this environment, if you want to hedge out the duration risk of your cash flows, the easiest way is to offset your long term investments with maybe a basket of stocks that have similar duration of cash flows. ', 'However, having said that, I think the risk reward of hedging these high-growth names with other high-growth names probably has come down considerably, given that we have seen one of the largest and most furious corrections in high-growth software over the last 20 years. So it’s more about then tactically adjusting your hedges, if you believe that certain assets may have overshot in this environment when others have not appropriately reacted.', 'Picker: What sectors are you interested in on the longer side and what sectors on the short side?', 'Hoffmann-Burchardi: On our long term thesis on data and digital, which we’re still very early in this new era of transformation, there are really two sectors that are very interesting. One is data infrastructure, and the other one is semiconductors. And, you know, in a sense, this is very much the picks and shovels strategy of the digital age, very much like in the Gold Rush of the 1840s. And it’s all about software and hardware to translate data into insights. And so for semiconductors, which is a very interesting industry, they’re the digital engine room of our economy, the digital economy, and it has an industry structure that is very benign, actually has gotten better over the years. Actually, the number of publicly traded semiconductor companies has come down over the last 10 years. ', 'And the barriers to entry in semiconductors have increased across the whole value chain. But even the design of a chip, if you go from 10 nanometers to five nanometers, it has increased by three times. So very benign competitive framework against an end demand that is now accelerating. Even if you look at, for instance, the automotive industry, they are going to see semi content increasing by more than five times over the next 10 years. And then on the data infrastructure side, it’s also very interesting. It’s a very nascent market. Only about 10% of software is currently data infrastructure software. And as companies have to deal with new and large amounts of varied data, they will have to overhaul the data infrastructure. And it’s incredibly sticky. It’s like building a foundation of a house. Very difficult to rip out once installed.', 'Picker: And how about on the short side? How do you see the best way to hedge what’s going on right now  in the market? ', 'Hoffmann-Burchardi: I think it’s more hedging the risk of higher interest rates as opposed to hedge out fundamentals. And so it’s just about matching cash flow duration patterns. But again, I think at this point, we’re probably overdone on some of the growth software sell-off. And it’s more about going into hedges that now help you price in maybe an overall slowdown on the index level, much more so than in those particular areas of technology.', 'Picker: Interesting, so hedging indexes, perhaps just as a way to protect the downside of the longer bets that you’re doing.', 'Hoffmann-Burchardi: Yeah, at least in the short term. Where we have seen most of the carnage in some pockets of the markets, but others have not really reacted to this higher rate environment.']",-1

Generally speaking, the more transistors you can fit onto a chip, the more powerful and efficient that chip will be.', '“The EUV light that ASML’s most advanced tools use has a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers, which lets you carve extraordinarily small shapes on silicon,” said Miller, who is in the process of writing a book about the history of the semiconductor industry.', 'The TSMC chips in the latest Apple iPhones, which were created with ASML’s EUV machines, have around 10 billion transistors on them, Miller added.', 'Beyond lithography, there are several other manufacturing processes that must be completed before a chip is ready for shipping. “Ultimately what you’re trying to do is build structures on the silicon using a mix of carving things out and depositing new chemicals onto it,” Miller said.', 'Given no one else can make EUV machines that are suitable for mass manufacturing, ASML has a monopoly on the segment and there’s no sign of anyone catching up.', '“ASML is absolutely critical to the entire semiconductor ecosystem,” Peter Hanbury, a semiconductor analyst at Bain & Co, told CNBC. “In some ways it’s just as important as TSMC.”', 'He added: “Every bleeding edge chip, starting at five nanometers, and going forward for likely a very long time, is going to be heavily reliant on ASML equipment.”', 'Semiconductor analysts believe it would take around a decade and billions of dollars for another company to get to a stage where it could start to compete with ASML.', '“ASML has around 4,000 suppliers that they’re aware of and their suppliers have suppliers as well,” said Miller.', 'Some of the key components in ASML’s EUV machines are particularly difficult to make.', 'The mirrors, for example, are made by German firm Zeiss in partnership with ASML and they’re the flattest structures humans have ever made.', '“These structures themselves are sort of marvels of engineering,” Miller said.

There, the government asked him to create a Taiwanese semiconductor company that would become a world leader. His idea: Focus only on manufacturing — what’s now known as a pure-play foundry.', '“When you’re just focused on one thing, you do one thing really well,” said Cassidy, who joined TSMC 23 years ago after what he describes as a fascinating hourslong meeting with Chang.', 'Chang bet big on a need that didn’t exist yet. When he founded TSMC in 1987, giants such as Intel and Texas Instruments took pride in designing and making their own chips. A legendary saying in the industry back then was “Real men have fabs.”', '“When Morris went out to get funding, he went to many named companies that you know, and they told them, ‘Morris, your idea won’t get off the ground. If you get it off the ground, it can’t scale.’”', 'But as chips got more complex, manufacturing them became an enormous undertaking. Analysts say building a fab today takes at least two years and $10 billion. It’s become nearly impossible for even the biggest chip companies — Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD — to do it all and keep up with the most advanced tech. Intel, for example, still designs and makes its own chips, but it’s fallen behind Samsung and TSMC in recent years and now relies on TSMC to make some of its chips. ', '“If you were a smart designer, you didn’t have to have billions of dollars and a fab behind you for the first time with the emergence of TSM,” Rolland said.', 'Now, each major step of chipmaking is often handled by a separate company. Some, such as Arm and MIPS, focus on IP and architecture, providing the core building blocks to design chips. Then there’s electronic design automation companies such as Cadence and Synopsys that write the software used to design chips. Only one company, ASML, makes the $180 million extreme ultraviolet light machines required to etch designs into the most advanced chips. Then there are the wildly successful fabless companies designing the chips, such as Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia and many more.', 'As these fabless companies took off, TSMC found itself on a flywheel making more and more of the world’s chips.', '“This has allowed [TSMC] to not only catch up, but in my opinion, surpass Intel, to become the world’s greatest manufacturing technology on the planet,” Rolland said, “one of the top 10 most valuable companies in terms of market cap in the globe.”', 'TSMC was first listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1994, and in 1997 it became the first Taiwan-based company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By the 2000s, it had caught up with the 20 or so other companies making the most advanced chips at the time. As the tech kept advancing, more and more companies fell behind. Today, only two manufacturers remain that can make the most advanced, 5-nanometer chips: TSMC and Samsung.', 'In 2013, Apple started relying on TSMC to make its A-series chips for the iPhone as it moved away from reliance on Samsung, a direct competitor in mobile phones. Today, there’s a TSMC chip inside every iPhone on the market. And Apple has moved away from Intel too, now relying on TSMC to make the chips inside most Macs.', 'In 2018, at age 86, Chang retired as chairman of TSMC. His radical pure-play foundry idea continues to pay off. With the opening of a new fab in Taiwan next year, TSMC is in a race with Samsung to make the world’s first 3-nanometer chips — with Intel planning to get there by 2025.', 'Right now, no fab in the U.S. can make 5-nanometer chips. But TSMC is changing that.', '“If you want more capacity, you have to build more fabs. And that’s one of the reasons that we’re moving to the U.S.,” Cassidy said. “Our customers want us in the U.S. The U.S. government wants us here.”', 'TSMC Technical Director Tony Chen took CNBC on a tour of the site where a four-story 2.3-million-square-foot fab is being erected. Chen has led 17 other fab construction projects in his 23 years with TSMC. ', '“This project is designed as a 5-nanometer fab. Actually, it’s a copy from the fab we have in Taiwan,” Chen said. ', 'Nearby, one of the world’s largest cranes was being lifted to its full height of 200 feet. The 2,300-ton crane was brought to the site on 153 semitrucks. Site supervisor Jim White said contractors have moved nearly 4 million cubic yards of dirt and have used more than 260 million gallons of water since construction began in April.', 'Building a fab and making chips takes an incredible amount of water, not an abundant resource in the middle of the desert. Arizona’s biggest water source is groundwater, but deep wells at big farms are using water up faster than it’s naturally replenished. Chen said TSMC needs around 4.7 million gallons of water each day to support production. ', 'TSMC is no stranger to water shortages. Taiwan is facing its worst drought in 56 years, something that TSMC said has not impacted production. In Arizona, TSMC said, an on-site water treatment center will recycle up to 90% of water used at the fab.', '“And then ultimately, that water will be reinjected into the aquifer in partnership with the city of Phoenix after reverse osmosis and other technology solutions are provided,” said Chris Camacho, president and CEO of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. He helped negotiate the deal that brought the project to Arizona.', 'Another challenge is that most 5-nanometer specialists are based in Asia. To solve this, TSMC’s academic relations manager, Roxanna Vega, said the company is bringing over some of its top experts from Taiwan.', '“They’re seen as subject matter experts on what they do in our fabs over there,” Vega said. “It’ll be a temporary assignment ... two, maybe three years.”', 'TSMC said it’s already sent more than 250 new U.S. hires to Taiwan for 12 to 18 months to get up to speed.', '“The opportunity to train in our 5-nanometer gigafab in Taiwan is to kind of give them that insight of how immense and how state of the art the tools, machinery and everything is going to be here in Arizona,” Vega said.', 'Diversification is a key reason for TSMC to bring advanced manufacturing to the U.S.', '“Taiwan is not very good when it comes to analog semiconductor design, and by moving to the United States you’d be able to tap into a much larger number of analog designers,” Rolland said.', 'Most of TSMC’s 12 fabs are in Taiwan and China, leaving the world vulnerable to potential slowdowns from natural disasters, including the current drought there, or the geopolitical tensions of the region. Some experts, however, refer to TSMC as Taiwan’s “silicon shield” in its fraught relationship with China.', '“The media paints a very bleak picture of this situation,” Rolland said, “but I’m actually much more optimistic — in part because of this idea [of] the semiconductor shield, because of this mutually beneficial relationship between the mainland and Taiwan itself. China as of right now needs them for their leading-edge manufacturing.”', 'The U.S. also depends heavily on the chips coming out of Taiwan — a key reason the government worked hard to convince TSMC to bring its tech here.', '“Arizona has a number of programs, including the Qualified Facility tax credit and the Quality Jobs tax credit, that’s really an incentive to help lower the cost of operations,” Camacho said. “In addition to that, the city of Phoenix put together a $200 million infrastructure package that helps TSMC access water and additional infrastructure needed.”', 'The Biden administration has proposed $52 billion in subsidies for chip companies such as TSMC to manufacture on U.S. soil.', 'Industry reports estimate a $50 billion investment from the U.S. government would enable the construction of 19 fabs in the U.S. over the next 10 years, effectively doubling domestic chip manufacturing capability.', 'As the shortage continues, similar investments are happening around the world. Industry association SEMI projects 72 new fabs or major expansions will come online by 2024 — 10 of them located in North and South America.', '“I heard more announcements of investments in the last two, three years than in my entire life,” said SEMI President and CEO Ajit Manocha. “And based on that we feel that by end of next year, we should start seeing some relief on the chip shortage.”', 'Until then, as demand continues to soar, TSMC is raising chip prices as much as 20%, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The cost could trickle down to consumers in the price of electronics. TSMC is also continuing to ramp up production capacity, including in the U.S., where the 1,100-acre Arizona site certainly has room for a second phase.', 'Watch the video to see the exclusive tour of TSMC’s Arizona site and inside the chip giant’s massive fabs in Taiwan.', 'Correction: This article has been updated to correct the location of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s new plant.']",102

', 'Yu said he thinks rising raw material costs will put pressure on Nio’s margins over at least the next few months, but he notes that the company has a plan to address that by using lower-cost lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries in its standard-range models.', 'Yu remains bullish on Nio with a buy rating and a price target of $50.', 'Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao is also still bullish on Nio, but he cut his bank’s price target to $34 from $66 in a Tuesday note, reflecting the stock’s recent slide. Hsiao wrote that “elevating macro headwinds and severe supply challenges” will make the near term challenging for Nio but he feels that its “superior liquidity and revenue visibility” have it well-positioned to ride out any economic downturn.']",3

Will some presents be harder to get hold of or more expensive?', 'That depends on what you’re after and how late you leave your Christmas shopping.', 'Semiconductors are beneath the hood of an increasing number of products — from cars and e-bikes to washing machines and toothbrushes. Many of these chips are in short supply as the Covid pandemic has led to supply chain bottlenecks and increased demand.', 'Alan Priestley, a semiconductor analyst at research firm Gartner, told CNBC that the chip shortage is bound to have some impact on Christmas.', '“We may find that some things that have been readily available in the past may not be readily available now,” he said, adding that instant gratification can no longer be found from the usual shopping services. “We’re all used to Amazon Prime: hit the button, it’s there in 24 hours. Maybe now you’ve got to wait two or three weeks.”', 'Many of today’s electronic products contain a large number of chips.', '“The issue we face is things made with chips don’t just use one chip,” Priestley said. “New smartphones have got many, many power control chips and it’s those chips that are in short supply.”', 'TSMC, Samsung and Intel, the heavyweights of the semiconductor industry, aren’t focused on making these older, less advanced power management chips because they can make more by selling more innovative versions.', 'Semiconductor-rich products like computers, smartphones and games consoles are likely to be popular Christmas presents, but there are availability problems, according to Glenn O’Donnell, VP and research director at analyst firm Forrester.', 'Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series S are widely unavailable, for example, as is Google’s Pixel 6 Pro smartphone.', '“If you can get them, you’re paying a high premium,” O’Donnell told CNBC.', '“I believe the supply issues including but not limited to semiconductors will cause a lot of trouble this season,” he added. “If you don’t already have what you want to put under the tree, you may be out of luck. Even Santa himself won’t be able to deliver.”', 'Berlin-based Jack de Santis, CEO of repair service Rebel Technology Labs, told CNBC that he’s looked “everywhere” for a Google Pixel 6 Pro — but to no avail. He’s unsure if he will stick with his old phone or get the regular Pixel 6, which is still available in a few places. “Both options are compromises I’m not happy with,” he said.', 'It’s not just other shoppers that consumers are competing with for in demand items this Christmas. Some people are using automated bots to snap up popular items as soon as they become available online at face value.', '“The bots buy up high-demand products to corner the market so they can then sell these at inflated prices,” O’Donnell said.', 'There are countless examples of PS5s and Xbox Series S consoles being sold on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree and other buy-and-sell platforms for considerably more than the recommended retail price.', 'Shoppers should consider buying desired electronics that are in stock and available sooner rather than later, Priestley warned.', '“If it’s there and available, make the purchase,” he said. “The issue is the supply lines are extended. As the goods that are in current supply get consumed, it’s going to take longer to replace them.”', 'Consumers who are able to be flexible with certain purchases may also have more luck. PCs, for example, come in lots of different configurations and the central processing unit (CPU) is often changeable.', '“It may well be that the your desired configuration is not available, but a different configuration is available,” Priestley said. “Consider alternatives.”']",102
