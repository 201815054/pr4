Electric vehicle buyers can accrue around 250,000 rupees in total benefits over their entire loan period, she said.', '“The government is trying to create demand, to spur demand, and thus help (original equipment manufacturers),” Puneet Gupta, associate director of automotive forecasting at IHS Markit, told CNBC. Gupta explained that car manufacturers in India have said that the lack of demand deters them from producing higher quantities of electric vehicles.', '“I think the first thing is to kickstart the demand because, right now, if you see, we’re selling less than 2,000 electric vehicles in a year, which is almost negligible,” Gupta said, adding that India has about 4 million light vehicles — cars, SUVs, and light trucks — today. “You’re not targeting the mass, you’re still targeting a limited population.”', 'India also lowered the taxation cost of electric vehicles compared to those that run on combustion engines. Gupta explained that an SUV that runs on fuel is charged 28% in Goods and Services Tax (GST). On top of that, an additional tax of around 20% is levied. ', 'Electric vehicles, which have an average selling price of 1.3 million rupees (about $19,000) in India, were initially taxed only 12% of GST. That number was lowered to 5%, according to Gupta.', 'The government is pushing hard on electric vehicles partly to try to reduce the dangerous levels of pollution present in its major metropolitan cities as well as to reduce India’s reliance on oil. India is a net importer of oil, which can lead to hefty import bills when global crude prices climb.', 'The global electric vehicles market is expanding, with countries like China, the United States and some members of the European Union leading the way.', 'An outlook report released in May from the International Energy Agency (IEA) said the global electric car fleet  in 2018 exceeded 5.1 million, up 2 million from the previous year and almost doubling the number of electric car sales. China remained the world’s largest electric car market and, by 2030, it is expected to own 57% of the electric vehicles market, IEA said in the report.', 'For its part, India still has a long way to go before electric cars become a mainstay in the country’s automobile market.', 'Gupta said IHS Markit’s prediction is that electric vehicles will make up about 4% of India’s overall auto market sales by 2030 — that would amount to almost 400,000 vehicles.', 'There are still plenty of challenges that India would need to overcome, including building out the charging infrastructure as well as improving the technology that is available. For its part, the government commenced the second phase of its Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles In India scheme that has earmarked about 100 billion rupees for a period of three years to provide upfront incentives to buyers and also to build out the necessary infrastructure.', '“We’re not talking about 20%, 30%, 50% electric vehicle market. Here, we’re just talking about (kickstarting) the electric vehicle marketshare,” Gupta said. “If Indians are convinced, things can change very fast.”']",104

Operator-less drilling and digging machines might mine water, oxygen-rich rocks and moon dust for use in 3-D printing of various materials.', '“We’ve had a longstanding relationship with NASA,” said Denise Johnson, group president of Caterpillar’s resource industries unit, which produces and markets mining and large construction products and accounted for $10 billion of Cat’s total $54.7 billion in sales and revenues in 2018.', 'Developing autonomous equipment is part of Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby’s goal to continuously improve upon Caterpillar’s legacy of innovation, as well as to generate new revenues in the face of competition and, more recently, the impact of tariffs in the ongoing U.S.–China trade war. Currently the company derives 5%–10% of its sales from China. On Wednesday, Caterpillar reported its third-quarter revenues and earnings, which missed estimates.', 'Most recently, NASA and Cat collaborated on a research project from 2004 to 2013. “The partnership focused on two technology areas: construction and robotic operations,” said the space agency’s spokesperson Clare Skelly in an email. “There are many synergies between what NASA needs to meet exploration goals and Caterpillar technologies used every day on Earth.”', 'Caterpillar’s initial R&D efforts to produce a fleet of autonomous equipment for the Earth-based mining industry date back to 1985. “By the early 1990s, we had two autonomous [hauling] trucks running at a quarry in Texas,” said Michael Murphy, chief engineer in the company’s surface mining and technology organization. His team has worked on GPS, radar, LIDAR, onboard diagnostics, artificial intelligence and other software and hardware technologies necessary for operating autonomous and remote-controlled vehicles, offered today under Cat’s Command and MineStar brands.', 'While Murphy’s team toiled away during the 1990s and early 2000s — sometimes in partnership with outside tech companies, university engineers, DARPA and even Cat’s mining customers — “the industry wasn’t ready for autonomy at that time,” he said. “They didn’t see the value proposition.”', 'Even so, that didn’t deter Caterpillar’s top brass from sticking to their long-term autonomy strategy, which along with the vehicles included developing technology to operate them within an entire mining operation, with the goal of increasing productivity, efficiency, cost controls and worker safety.', '“It’s great if you can provide a piece of equipment, but how it works in a system — because a mine is a system of equipment that works together, almost like a factory — becomes really important,” Johnson explained. “Autonomy knits it all together to make those operations more efficient. It’s a great example of a shift in our business model.”', 'Caterpillar’s strategy is starting to pay off — and may give the company a jump on competitors such as Komatsu, Hitachi, Sandvik and Volvo, equipment makers also selling autonomous equipment. “We have more autonomous sites than any other provider,” Johnson said.', 'Autonomy is becoming a key component in the current evolution within the $683 billion global industry, comprising the top 40 mining companies. A report from Zion Market Research estimates that the global mining automation market will nearly double, to $6.18 billion in 2025 from $3.65 billion last year.', '“Three or four years ago not many mining companies were thinking about digital and innovation,” said Andrew Swart, global leader of Deloitte’s mining and metals practice. “Today there’s a rapid adoption of technology — replacing people with autonomous vehicles, automating mining processes and more digitization in back-office operations. It’s an industry in pretty rapid transformation, with some companies challenging existing business models.”', 'Caterpillar is leading the autonomy revolution with both its vehicles and operational software. “We now have seven customers and we’re on 11 different sites,” Johnson said, “mining oil sands, iron ore, copper and gold and soon coal.” Cat has deployed 220 of its own trucks, both brand-new autonomous vehicles — costing from $3.5 million to $5 million each — and existing ones that have been retrofitted.', '“We’re also converting competitors’ trucks,” Johnson said. “Our solution needs to be interoperable. It’s a competitive decision we don’t take lightly, because we recognize there are other [autonomy] providers.”', 'Caterpillar autonomy customers are reporting at least a 30% improvement in productivity when compared to manned operations, Murphy said. One customer, he added, has announced an 80% improvement in safety incidents since introducing autonomous hauling.', 'Most of the autonomy activity is occurring at mine sites outside the U.S., although Newmont Goldcorp, headquartered near Denver, has tested two semiautonomous Caterpillar underground loaders at its Leeville gold mines in northern Nevada. The pilot program has since increased to six fully autonomous loaders, according to Northern Nevada Business View.', 'London-based mining giant Rio Tinto began operating autonomous equipment at an iron-ore mine in western Australia’s Pilbara region a decade ago. “We have grown our autonomous fleet to more than 130 trucks, both from Caterpillar and Komatsu, and 26 drills,” said Stephen McIntosh, group executive, growth and innovation, at Rio Tinto.', 'To transport tons of material from the site to port facilities in the region, Rio Tinto has developed AutoHaul, a fully autonomous heavy-haul train. “Each autonomous train comprises two or three locomotives and some 240 ore cars, making them each 2.4 km [1.49 miles] long,” McIntosh said. “In essence, these are the world’s largest and longest robots.”', 'Rio Tinto has incorporated nearly complete autonomy into its new Koodaideri iron ore mine in Pilbara, including autonomous trucks, drills and trains, McIntosh said. While there are limited personnel at both the Pilbara sites, the mining operations, as well as AutoHaul, are monitored from Rio Tinto’s control center hundreds of miles away in Perth.', 'The Pilbara mines are located in an isolated, hazardous area, presenting a workforce challenge, which dovetails perfectly with Caterpillar’s autonomy strategy. “Customers are finding it difficult to operate in those remote locations, getting personnel in and out in a consistent way, which drives the value proposition” of autonomy, Johnson said. “The application of the technology becomes a necessity to make it work from a value-add perspective.”', 'That same strategy could apply to NASA’s Artemis program on the moon, not to mention Mars and asteroids, which are being studied as potential sites for so-called space mining. Yet the notion of extracting platinum, gold and other valuable minerals from heavenly bodies and propelling them back to Earth is more fiction than science. “The economic analysis doesn’t make sense,” said Angel Abbud-Madrid, director of the Center for Space Resources at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, when you consider the costs to identify, extract, process, refine and transport them. Combined, they’re virtually out of this world.', 'More realistic, Abbud-Madrid said, is the idea of using a variety of resources to sustain extraterrestrial bases for long periods of time. NASA has been exploring the concept, known as in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), for its outer-space missions — which brings us back to Caterpillar. “ISRU would require infrastructure and a suite of supporting capabilities that can operate with a certain degree of autonomy,” said Skelly, though declining to name Cat as a potential partner.', 'The difficult logistics and the multi-billions it would cost to rocket mining and construction equipment into space still need to be worked out, but in the meantime, Caterpillar continues to prepare for otherworldly opportunities. One example is the company’s primary sponsorship of NASA’s annual Robotic Mining Competition, a university-level event held at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. More than 45 collegiate teams design and build remote-controlled mining robots to traverse a simulated Martian terrain.', 'Whether or not Cat’s autonomous equipment will someday be operating on Mars and the moon remains to be seen. “I don’t know if we’ve thought that far ahead,” Johnson said. More immediate is continuing to develop its autonomy strategy in an increasing competitive marketplace. “We always want to challenge ourselves to think outside the box,” she concluded.']",-1

In recent years, efforts have been made to reduce their impact on the environment.', 'Since January 2018, taxis in London being licensed for the first time have had to be “zero emission capable.” Their carbon dioxide emissions must not be greater than 50 grams per kilometer and they need to have a minimum zero emission range of 30 miles. The Dynamo Taxi is priced at £55,495 ($71,461) although it is eligible for a £7,500 grant to reduce costs. It adds to London’s sustainable transport options, joining the London EV Company’s TX vehicle on city streets. Powered by a lithium-ion battery, the TX utilizes a petrol range extender. Central London is now home to an Ultra Low Emissions Zone, or ULEZ. The ULEZ operates 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Vehicles which do not meet the ULEZ’s emissions standards are required to pay a daily charge to drive in the zone. Taxis with a London license are exempt from the charge, although there is a 15-year age limit for the vehicles.']",104

Users of the scooter service locate their vehicles via an app, paying for their ride through an account with the company. In the U.S., it costs $1 to unlock a vehicle and then 15 cents per minute.', 'Speaking to CNBC’s Karen Tso Thursday, Bolt said that, having retired from sport, he was entering a new chapter of his life. “Through traveling, through my times as a track athlete, I’ve learned that the cities around the world need help with congestion,” he said. Bolt, one of the most successful and iconic athletes of all time, is a co-founder of the business.

Our designs with our scooters are all customized so we can recycle every single part, including the batteries.” The way people move around urban areas is changing, with ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft now offered in major cities across the world. Well established cycle-share schemes are also available in capitals such as London and Paris.', 'In the electric scooter market, Usain Bolt’s venture is one of many looking to tap in to the shared transport sector. Firms such as Bird, Lime, and Bolt – formerly known as Taxify – also offer users a platform that allows them to locate and hire electric scooters using their smartphone.', 'Whether electric scooters take off and become a popular mode of transport for urban commuters remains to be seen. Regulatory hurdles pose a significant challenge to their mass adoption.', 'In the U.K., for example, e-scooters are considered to be “powered transporters.” This means that, currently, they are defined as being “motor vehicles” and it is illegal to use them on a public road without complying with several requirements, which in practice is difficult.  Use of powered transporters on U.K. pavements and cycle lanes is also prohibited.Change is afoot, however. In March 2019, the government announced what it described as “the biggest review into transport in a generation.” The review will look at regulations surrounding vehicles such as e-scooters and e-cargo bike trailers and will explore modernizing old laws that date back to the 1800s.']",-1

', 'In August 2018, for example, the Hyundai Motor announced that the first journey by an autonomous truck on a South Korean highway had taken place. The firm’s Xcient truck, which has a maximum load capacity of 40 tons, drove around 40 kilometers between Uiwang and Incheon. The vehicle used an autonomous driving system that allowed it to accelerate, decelerate, steer and maneuver through traffic without needing input from a human, although one was on board to take control as and when required. Back in Barcelona, Arm Holdings’ Segars gave an insight into the technology required for autonomous vehicles. “Self-driving cars have … racks of servers in them, that’s great for prototyping, but if you want to make millions of them then you’ve got to shrink it down, so there has to be a pathway to get all of that technology into very low cost, very power efficient chips.”']",104
