The year was 2019, and at the time, the idea of oil and gas companies joining forces with bitcoin miners was considered both avant-garde — and a major taboo.', 'But Whitehead, an engineer hailing from a family with a long history in oil and gas production, and Lohstroh, a finance major with a bitcoin obsession, ignored the skeptics, and sunk all the cash they had earned from their high school side gigs in lawn care and landscaping into Giga Energy Solutions, a company that mints bitcoin from stranded natural gas.', 'For years, oil and gas companies have struggled with the problem of what to do when they accidentally hit a natural gas formation while drilling for oil. Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. But if it’s 20 miles from a pipeline, drillers often burn it off, or flare it. That is why you will typically see flames rising from oil fields.', 'Beyond the environmental implications of flare gas, drillers are also, in effect, burning cash. To these two 23-year-old Aggie alums, it was a big problem with an obvious solution.', 'Giga places a shipping container full of thousands of bitcoin miners on an oil well, then diverts the natural gas into generators, which convert the gas into electricity that is then used to power the miners. The process reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared to continued flaring, according to research from Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems.', '“Growing up, I always saw flares, just being in the oil and gas industry. I knew how wasteful it was,” Whitehead told CNBC on the sidelines of the North American Prospect Expo summit in Houston, a flagship event for the industry. “It’s a new way to not only lower emissions but to monetize gas.”', 'Whitehead tells CNBC they have signed deals with more than 20 oil and gas companies, four of which are publicly traded. Giga also says they’re also in talks with sovereign wealth funds, and they are expanding, fast. Giga’s 11-person team is adding another six employees this month.', 'Lohstroh and Whitehead are part of a growing movement of people placing big bets on the potential for bitcoin mining to transform the economics of the energy industry.', '“They are making their clients revenue through stranded energy bitcoin mining and solving the environmental challenge with flared gas at the same time,” said Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council.', 'The Giga executives are also big believers in the power of bitcoin to create a new kind of financial freedom.', '“No one controls it, and you don’t have to ask permission to use it,” said Lohstroh. “That’s really what drew me to bitcoin.”', 'It’s a similar sentiment for Whitehead, who tells CNBC that his views on self sovereignty, privacy, and individualism are part of what sent him down the proverbial bitcoin rabbit hole.', '“I wasn’t so much focused on the price, as I was the adoption. I thought this was something great for humanity,” said Whitehead.', 'You can think of bitcoin mining both as the security layer for the network and as the method by which new bitcoin are entered into circulation.', 'A bitcoin mining rig runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. ', '“The cool thing about bitcoin that is under-appreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it’s a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,” said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a Canadian company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.', 'Enter the oil and gas business, which often features sites in remote parts of Texas, far from major population centers.', 'More often than not, if a gas well isn’t already stationed near a pipeline, it won’t be big enough to warrant the time and expense of building an entirely new line. And if a driller can’t immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most dispose of it on site.', 'One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. ', 'But flares are only 75 to 90% efficient, explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data. “Even with a flare, some of the methane is being vented without being combusted,” he said.', 'This is when on-site bitcoin mining can prove to be especially impactful.', 'When the methane is run into an engine or generator, 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Ortolf. ', '“But nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,” he said. “So unless it’s economically sustainable, producers won’t internally combust the gas.”', 'Bitcoin makes it economically sustainable for oil and gas companies to combust their methane, rather than externally combust it with a flare, rendering stranded gas a thing of the past.', 'But Ortolf has taken years to convince people that parking a trailer full of ASICs on an oil and gas field is a smart and financially sound idea.', '“In 2018, I got laughed out of the room when I talked about mining bitcoin on flared gas,” said Ortolf. “The concept of bringing hydrocarbons to market without a counterparty was laughable.”', 'Fast forward four years, and business at Upstream is booming. It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America.', '“This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could’ve gotten,” said Ortolf. “They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they’re no longer limited by geography to sell energy.” ', 'Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity.', '“The thing about oil and gas is that it is a very distributed and reliable power source, and because of that, a distributed sales point and reliable power draw like a bitcoin mine is quite a good fit,” said Barbour. “It’s sort of a match made in heaven actually.”', 'The summer before his junior year in college, Whitehead was mowing his parents’ lawn in the southeast Texas town of Buna (population circa 2,000 people) when he got a text from Lohstroh, then a classmate and friend. In it, Lohstroh suggested they buy a mobile bitcoin mining container from Upstream Data and hitch it to a gas well themselves.', '“I just instantly stopped the lawn mower, walked straight to my dad, and I was like, ‘I gotta find flare gas right now,’” said Whitehead.', 'It was a natural reaction for Whitehead, who comes from a long line of “wildcats,” a term used to describe those who engage in high-risk exploratory drilling.', '“I call myself a digital wildcatter because now this is this next phase of wildcatting — bitcoin mining going to natural gas wells,” he said.', 'A week after Whitehead got the text, he and Lohstroh hopped on a plane up to Canada. Logistical acrobatics ensued, including having to drive a U-Haul truck three hours to Upstream’s facility in Calgary since neither was old enough to rent a car, but the pair wasn’t phased.', 'Upstream’s lead engineer and founder, Steve Barbour, tells CNBC he initially tried to warn Lohstroh not to make a purchase, since the container was still being field tested, but Lohstroh was committed to getting an order in.', '“True bitcoiners those two...they’re go-getters,” Barbour said of the Giga co-founders. “Both of them are what I, as a Canadian, think of Texans — entrepreneurial and wholesome. Just awesome dudes.”', 'Once the college classmates had the physical equipment they needed, they leveraged a connection who had some flare gas.', 'From there, they pounded the pavement looking to drum up business. At the 2020 NAPE summit, the Giga co-founders say they handed out about a thousand pamphlets trying to sell people on the idea of monetizing stranded gas.', '“A lot of people didn’t know about it. Most people laughed at us. Most people said, ‘It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,’” Whitehead said. Others said it was cool, but they didn’t think it would work, and then, there were a few who said we needed to talk to the company’s CEO.', 'Then came the pandemic.', '“Covid hit and shut down the world,” Whitehead told CNBC. Despite nationwide lockdowns, Giga continued to run 35 miners at its launch site, but business development virtually ground to a halt.', '“There was no traction in the space,” said Lohstroh. “Bitcoin was in a bear market. We were running around to meetings trying to draw up interest about bitcoin mining, and there was no interest at all.”', 'The team got creative by tracking down smaller customers in north and east Texas who were either “breaking the rules” or couldn’t get permits and were just wasting the gas. As Whitehead describes it, these smaller companies were often the ones that neglected regulatory compliance.', '“We were able to come in and say, ‘Hey, you’re flaring, and you shouldn’t be. You’re doing stuff that’s illegal, and you have opportunity here, because you have a shut-in well. We can take all this gas,’” recounted Whitehead.', 'But the real turning point for the company came in Dec. 2020, when the price of bitcoin broached the $20,000 threshold. That’s when some of the bigger players in the oil and gas industry started to take note, and leaders from publicly-traded companies began to approach them about getting into business.', 'Giga has also had companies fly in from abroad to shadow their operations and learn how the process works.', '“We’ve had people from companies in Saudi Arabia come to our sites in East Texas. And you know, they’ve probably never even seen a pine tree before, and we’re bringing them out for barbecue and showing them a bitcoin mine. They love it,” said Whitehead.', 'Giga tells CNBC that its revenue was more than $4 million in 2021, and it’s on track to earn more than $20 million by the end of 2022.', 'Whitehead says that some of their mining sites have helped to revitalize the local economy by creating jobs, such as field technicians and bitcoin pumpers, who go out to check the sites. In the small communities where they’ve set up a bitcoin mine, they are sometimes the largest source of revenue.', '“An area that was just a ghost town has now found ways to take their stranded energy that they were wasting and monetize it, and that’s what gets me excited, because like that’s what is helping the community overall,” said Whitehead.', 'Countless bitcoin miners now say that oil and gas is going to dominate the crypto mining industry in the coming decades, which bodes well for Giga’s business model.', '“It’s a frenzy out there,” said Barbour.', 'But Lohstroh tells CNBC the next stage is for the energy producers themselves to become the bitcoin miners.', '“I think that’s the next large transition, whether that’d be power producers, natural gas producers, upstream, midstream, downstream. I think at all sectors within the industry space, they’re going to be affected by bitcoin mining, because bitcoin mining is innately tied to power, and the point of energy is to create power. And so I think you’re gonna see a lot of semantics and how they’re interrelated,” he said.']",-1

The analysts said they expect OPEC+ to keep a floor under prices.', '“Unless there’s a deep recession, we expect their mutual vulnerabilities will continue to provide the gel they need to largely keep their supply discipline intact,” said Citigroup strategists. “What’s more, the longer they wait, the more likely medium-term supply will flounder due to reduced capital spending.”', 'Blanch said OPEC will have to delay the return of more oil this year, unless demand picks up into the high 90 million barrels a day, not now expected by OPEC.', '“If it’s a cold winter, maybe they get saved by the cold winter. If [virus] cases are not skyrocketing everywhere, they’re in better shape,” said Blanch. He noted one bright spot for the oil industry is that there has been no decline in petrochemical demand.', 'The U.S. industry has dramatically cut back production, from a high of 13.1 million barrels to 10.7 million a day earlier in mid-September. Demand for gasoline remains much weaker than normal at about 8.5 million barrels a day, down from 9.35 million barrels a year ago. U.S. drivers are an important factor in the global oil market, as U.S. gasoline sales normally account for about 10% of world oil demand.', '“The economics are still not great for the U.S. but I think one of the big question marks is: ‘If the U.S. started to come back would the Russians just say we’re not going to do this anymore?’ Constrained output is helpful in keeping the Russians on board with OPEC+,” said Croft.', 'Blanch said another factor for oil prices is the Libyan oil is expected to come back on line. “If they’re back at full throttle, they’ll be back at one million barrels a day. That’s an extra million barrels they don’t need,” Blanch said.', 'That could also pressure OPEC+ when it looks to return oil to the market. “If demand doesn’t go into the high 90s [million barrels a day], OPEC is going to have some problems and they’ll have to extend the cuts,”  he said.', ' ']",100

', 'Energy executives, policymakers and thousands of others gathered in Texas this week as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has thrust energy — prices, security, the transition to renewables — into the headlines, alongside the tales of human suffering.', 'Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was a keynote speaker, and she surprised the audience with a strong call to pick up the pace of oil production. Across hundreds of panels, and between every session in the conference’s halls, experts debated what happens next, and what the global energy complex should look like going forward. Should the U.S. drill more oil and gas? Does energy security mean building out renewables and moving away from dependence on hydrocarbons? Will natural gas be the bridge fuel? What role do investors play in production policies?', 'On the ground at the conference, there was a sense of optimism among attendees in the oil and gas industry over the vital services that their companies provide. Through conversations with more than a dozen people, who were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the companies they represent, opinions differed over matters including whether spiking oil and gas prices will fuel or cool the energy transition. But a common thread was that so-called traditional energy companies need to be part of the conversation.', '“I actually feel very proud to work for an oil and gas company … we’re providing energy for the people,” said one conference attendee. “There has been kind of an attack on the oil and gas industry,” said another, before adding that the conflict has put a spotlight on energy integration. “There will be an energy mix. We’ll need fossil fuels and then we also need to move into renewable energy, but it has got to be a gradual process,” the person said.', '“I’m very happy to work in oil and gas … it is an industry of technology [and] innovation,” one attendee put it. “I think our industry is leading the way,” echoed another, adding that “natural gas infrastructure can contribute to ambitious environmental goals including decarbonization, and net-zero.”', 'At this point no one doubts, even in the oil and gas industry, that the energy transition is coming — it is, after all, unfolding before our eyes. But opinions vary widely on what the pace will look like. Projections for when oil demand will peak are all over the place. Against this uncertain backdrop, oil and gas companies have made some forays into decarbonization technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen, which were on display at CERAWeek. Companies including Exxon, Oxy, Saudi Aramco and Petronas had sleek displays showcasing their efforts on these fronts.', '“It’s pretty exciting,” said one person. “There’s a lot going on to shift and grow the industry away from what it used to be.”', 'But in the short term, oil demand is projected to hit a high above 100 million barrels per day this year. And with prices already elevated the question of when, or even if, producers raise output is front and center.', '“It will lead the industry to accelerate the energy transition, but in the near term I think that we will see more oil and gas because the world needs it,” said one participant, who’s a director at an independent oil and gas company. ', 'Top of mind, of course, was Russia’s ability to have a large impact on the global energy trade by controlling so much oil and natural gas production, and because the market is “so interlocked and interconnected.”', 'Even before the Ukrainian crisis, oil prices had been slowly but steadily climbing out of the never-before-seen lows hit during the pandemic. The U.S. oil benchmark even briefly traded in negative territory as the virus sapped demand for petroleum products.', 'Demand has since recovered, while supply has remained constrained, pushing prices higher. The day Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.S. and global oil benchmarks jumped above $100, and just over a week later they topped $130. Brent crude, the international oil marker, nearly hit $140. Russia produces about 10 million barrels of oil per day, roughly half of which it exports. The nation is a key supplier to Europe, and fears of production loss in an already tight market sent prices soaring.', 'President Joe Biden has since banned energy imports from Russia, although the U.S. doesn’t actually import all that much from Russia. It would be far more significant if Europe were to impose similar measures. Still, even before sanctions targeting the energy industry were announced, buyers were already shunning Russian products in fear of falling afoul of the restrictions.', 'While U.S. producers might previously have been eager to open the taps as prices climbed from $50, to $60, $75, $90 and then above $100, the companies have emerged from the pandemic with a different mindset. It’s no longer all about growth — a point that was underscored again and again in Houston. Companies are focusing on capital discipline and shareholder returns in the form of buybacks and dividends. Once boatloads of cash are being returned to investors, it’s not easy to go back to those very same investors – some of whom weathered years of poor returns – and say it’s time to start drilling again.', 'That’s not to say that production hasn’t returned at all. The number of oil and gas rigs for the week ending Friday rose for the ninth time in the last 10 weeks, according to data from oilfield services company Baker Hughes. The number of oil rigs now stands at 527, which is the highest since April 2020. However, the number is still sharply below pre-pandemic levels, which had been above 700 rigs. ', 'While the high fuel prices are unquestionably a gusher for the oil industry, at a certain point even oil companies don’t want such high prices. It turns Washington’s attention squarely on the industry, while also running the risk of tipping the economy into a recession.', '“I think if oil prices continue to be high, we certainly go into recession,” said one attendee in Houston who’s the deputy director of production at an integrated oil company. Estimates for where oil prices go next vary widely, but some believe $200 is around the corner if Russia’s war rages on.', '“That’s not good for the consumer. That’s also not very good for the industry,” noted another conference goer. The national average for a gallon of gas topped $4 on Sunday, and prices have jumped further over the course of the week.', 'Addressing climate change has been one of the Biden administration’s key tenets, and oil and gas companies say policies have been unfriendly to their industry. Permitting delays are often cited. White House officials refute these claims, saying they’ve issued permits, but the industry isn’t acting.', 'But the administration’s tone seemed much different in Houston on Wednesday, when Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm addressed CERAWeek. She essentially pleaded with companies to drill, in a speech that was often at odds with the Biden administration’s decarbonization goals.', 'She even appealed directly to oil and gas shareholders. “I hope your investors are saying these words to you as well: in this moment of crisis, we need more supply,” she said before a room full of energy executives.', 'One person in the industry described the predicament that oil and gas companies find themselves in – beholden to shareholders even as officials ask companies to raise output – as a “self-inflicted wound.”', '“Investors wanted capital discipline from oil and gas companies in the U.S. As a result, we have been giving money back to shareholders by a lot,” the person added. This decreases the companies’ incentive to ramp up oil production quickly.', 'All else being equal, if oil and gas companies did decide to increase output tomorrow, it would still be months before operations are up and running.', '“It’s very hard to fix these things. Nobody has. … Nothing will be immediate,” said one person.']",-1

However, experts say the stratospheric prices seen in Europe are unlikely to carry over to the States.', 'Much will ultimately depend on what the winter weather brings. But the U.S. is better positioned heading into the colder months, given that it’s the world’s largest natural gas producer and that inventory levels are not as depleted as they are in Europe.', '“We’re at a unique point in time now where just all energy prices are going up,” Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities, equity derivatives and cross-asset quantitative investment strategies at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said last week on CNBC’s “The Exchange.” “The U.S. is much more insulated from this global energy trend than the rest of the world,” he added.', 'That’s not to say U.S. prices won’t be volatile. Natural gas futures settled at their highest level since December 2008 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the contract traded as high as $6.466 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). ', 'Natural gas for November delivery has since eased from that level, but it’s still on track for the seventh straight week of gains. The contract currently trades around $5.63 per MMBtu, which is more than double where prices were at the beginning of the year. ', 'But the moves abroad are far more extreme. Analysts at Deutsche Bank noted that in Europe prices are up fivefold, while in the U.S. and Asia prices are about 1.5 times higher. In Europe, the price spike in natural gas is equivalent to if oil were trading around $200 per barrel.', '“The importance of these moves on inflation, growth and external accounts are not to be underestimated,” the firm wrote in a note to clients. “These price moves are a big deal.”', 'Coal and oil prices are also jumping. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, topped $80 per barrel on Friday for the first time since November 2014. International benchmark Brent crude, meanwhile, traded at its highest level since 2018. Analysts say that elevated natural gas prices could even prompt utilities to swap the fuel for oil.', 'Several factors are fueling the price surge in natural gas and commodities such as oil and coal more generally.', 'Demand is rebounding as economies get back to business and consumers return to pre-pandemic activities. At the same time, producers, who suffered through 2020′s unprecedented downturn, have been slow to hike output. ', 'A colder and longer-than-expected 2020 winter meant that European inventory levels were below average heading into the fall. On top of that, slow wind speeds and dry conditions weighed on renewables’ energy output. Carbon offsets are pricey and the continent has moved away from coal-fired plants, meaning everyone was suddenly competing for natural gas.', 'Europe’s gas production has declined over the last two decades, and the continent now depends on imports from Russia. The country has limited supplies to Europe this year in what some have called a politically motivated move, although this week President Vladimir Putin said Russia could boost output in an effort to alleviate the strain in Europe. ', 'Europe is not the only place in need of supplies. Asian demand is jumping as countries including China look to shift away from dependence on coal. In some cases, cargoes are bypassing Europe for Asia, where they can get better prices. ', 'The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies summarized this confluence of factors, noting it creates “this perfect storm.”', 'While the U.S. has its own power problems, as demonstrated in Texas last winter when millions of customers were left in the dark for multiple days, the same price jump and energy crunch playing out in Europe and Asia is unlikely to happen.', '″[The U.S.] hasn’t had to rely on the rest of the world to provide its supply, and that’s really what Europe’s problem has been,” said Robert Thummel, managing director at TortoiseEcofin. He noted that the shortage stems not from a lack of supply, but rather from a lack of infrastructure — specifically for liquified natural gas. ', '“You’re not going to see the U.S. to the rescue here, because there’s just not enough infrastructure on either side — on the U.S. side or the European side and most importantly on the Asian side — to solve this,” he added.', 'At the end of the day, Thummel said his forecast for natural gas prices all comes down to weather. A normal winter could see prices stay slightly elevated in the $3 to $4 range, while warmer-than-expected temperatures could see a retreat to between $2.50 and $3. On the flip side, if temperatures drop prices could spike into the double digits.', 'While the U.S. is in a better position than Europe heading into the winter, such wild swings in overseas energy markets do have cascading effects around the globe. This week Credit Suisse lifted its forecast for fourth-quarter prices by more than 60% — from $3.50 MMBtu to $5.75 MMBtu.', '“The near-term set-up around winter storage inventories and increasingly tight global demand fundamentals have proven more bullish than we had anticipated,” the firm wrote in a note to clients. While the new target is elevated relative to average prices in recent years, it’s still below the $6 level natural gas crossed last week.', 'JPMorgan, meanwhile, raised its 2022 annual average price forecast by $1.70 MMBtu to $4.81 MMBtu in a note titled “Unthinkable upside, limited downside.” The firm pointed out that it’s atypical to adjust forecasts right before winter weather reports become available. But this time it was warranted. Analysts said there was an “absolute need” to adjust forecasts given the “risks that are plaguing this balance at the current time.”', '“We go where the US supply and demand balance takes us, and it has taken us to a place that hasn’t been visited in quite some time,” the firm said. For the current quarter, JPMorgan envisions prices averaging $5.50 MMBtu, which would bring 2021′s average price to $3.65 MMBtu.', 'While the energy crunch is likely the primary driver of the price action, some of the volatility could also be from Wall Street firms shorting futures into the massive rally and subsequently being forced to cover positions.']",-1
