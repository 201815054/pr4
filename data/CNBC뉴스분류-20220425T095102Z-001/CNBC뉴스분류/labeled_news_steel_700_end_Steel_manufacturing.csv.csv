', 'The 22-year-old  and other trade deals became  lightning rods for voter anger in the U.S. industrial heartland states that swept Trump to  power this month. Trump -- who on Monday vowed to file notice of his  intent to quit an Asia-Pacific trade deal on his first day in office -- has pledged  to leave NAFTA if it can’t be improved to his liking. But he has said little  about what improvements he wants, apart from halting the migration of U.S.  factories and jobs to Mexico. ', 'Trade experts, academics and government officials  say Canada and Mexico would also seek tough concessions and that NAFTA’s zero-tariff  rate would be extremely difficult to alter. And any renegotiation would likely  take several years. ', '“In a renegotiation, one side can come in with  requests, but the other side is going to expect concessions,” said Wendy Cutler, a former  deputy U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). “We need to know what we’re going to ask  for and what we can give.” ', 'When Cutler helped renegotiate a stalled trade deal  with South Korea in 2010, USTR won concessions for U.S. automakers, but at the  expense of a longer phase-out on steep Korean pork tariffs and allowing Korea to  largely maintain a health care reimbursement system that favors domestic generic  drugmakers. ', 'Trump, who during the campaign called NAFTA the  “worst trade deal ever” and threatened to levy a 35-percent tariff on Mexican-assembled autos  and other goods, would have a hard time raising U.S. tariffs without  scrapping the agreement, trade experts say. ', '“There is no precedent in free trade negotiations  for one side raising tariffs more than the other,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at  the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington.', '“If U.S. workers are more expensive than Mexican  workers, the only way to level the playing field is to do things that raise costs in  Mexico,” Bown said. ', 'Negotiating stronger environmental and labor  protections would be one way of doing this, as it would increase manufacturing costs in a  lower-income country like Mexico. ', 'The Trump transition leader for trade, Dan Dimicco,  declined Reuters’ requests for comment. DiMicco, who is under consideration to be  Trump’s top trade negotiator, is a former chief executive of steel giant  Nucor Corp. who has long fought for protections against unfairly traded  imports. ', 'In a YouTube video message published on Monday,  Trump vowed to quit the  (TPP), a proposed 12-country  Pacific-rim trade bloc. Although the TPP terms were settled more than a year ago, the  pact was never taken up by U.S. Republican leaders in Congress due in part to  anti-free-trade rhetoric in the presidential campaign.     ', 'Calling it a “a potential disaster for our  country”, Trump said his administration would instead negotiate “fair, bilateral trade  deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.”  ', 'His comments would appear to snuff out any hopes  among other TPP countries that the pact championed by President Barack Obama could be  revived under the new administration. ', 'Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said at a  Pacific Rim summit on Saturday that he would be willing to discuss NAFTA with Trump to  “modernize” the treaty -- but not renegotiate existing provisions. ', 'He said that modernization could include adding  environmental, labor and other provisions that weren’t contemplated when NAFTA was being  negotiated in the early 1990s.', 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met  with Pena Nieto on the APEC sidelines, said he was “keeping our options open” on trade  discussions with the U.S. president-elect. ', 'But if NAFTA is reopened, Canada will insist that  any renegotiation bring an end to a decades-old dispute over Canadian exports of softwood  lumber, said David MacNaughton, Canada’s ambassador to the United  States. ', 'U.S. producers claim the Canadian wood is unfairly  subsidized because it comes from federal lands and have threatened to seek billions of  dollars in tariffs, which Canadian officials say would make a “mockery” of  free trade.', 'For Mexico’s part, any concessions that would favor  U.S. industrial goods could be met with demands to increase U.S. import quotas for  Mexican sugar and protections for Mexico’s potato crop. ', 'And both Mexico and Canada would likely demand  greater access to compete for U.S. public sector procurements, now largely protected by “Buy  America” laws. A major Trump administration infrastructure spending program would  make this a more enticing target, Cutler said. ', '  Since NAFTA was enacted, total U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico  has quadrupled to $1.3 trillion a year, but the U.S. combined goods  trade deficit with Canada and Mexico has grown from $9.1 billion in 1993 to  $76.2 billion in 2015. ', 'NAFTA’s effect on U.S. jobs is disputed. Critics  such as the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute charge that it has led to the loss of  some 850,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, while proponents such as the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce claim the trade growth has added a net 5 million jobs in the  United States.   ', 'The non-partisan Congressional Research Service  concluded that NAFTA has had only a small positive effect on U.S. growth, but has helped U.S.  manufacturers become more competitive due to more efficient supply chains.', 'A renegotiated NAFTA could, ironically, end up  borrowing key elements from the TPP to stiffen provisions on environment, labor and digital  economy standards, trade experts said.', 'Mexico and  have already agreed in the TPP to  “fully enforceable” labor and environmental improvements, meaning that punitive  duties could be imposed on countries that don’t comply -- a major step-up from  NAFTA.', 'TPP also included provisions governing e-commerce  and cross-border data flows -- sectors that barely existed as NAFTA was negotiated in  the early 1990s -- to better protect intellectual property and ensure a free and  open internet.', 'Officials in all three countries say NAFTA needs modernization in  this area. Trump economic advisers Peter Navarro and Wilbur  Ross have suggested, however, that the TPP environmental, health and safety standards  aren’t strong enough.  ', 'In an economic white paper and various opinion  pieces, Navarro, a University of California-Irvine business professor and Ross, a billionaire  private equity investor who is being considered by Trump to lead the Commerce  Department, said they want future U.S. trade deals to include “prompt triggers and  automatic renegotiation if trade gains are not distributed fairly.” ', 'They also want “ironclad sanctions” against  currency manipulation, and “zero tolerance” for intellectual property theft. ', '“In any negotiation or renegotiation, our guiding  principle should be this: Enter into a free trade agreement only if it both increases total  trade and reduces our trade deficit,” they wrote.

of the WTO’s (World Trade Organization) governing body on Monday.', 'The administration of President Donald Trump no longer faces any legal obstacles for its set of previously scheduled sanctions against European goods that could now take effect Friday, after a three-person WTO tribunal of arbitrators earlier this month issued a ruling that allowed the enactment of $7.5 billion worth of countermeasures — an historically high amount.', 'According to a Geneva trade official, the U.S. ambassador to the WTO, Dennis Shea, told WTO members that the size of the award approved Monday documents a point the U.S. has long made, that European subsidies to Airbus had caused massive harm to the U.S. economy over the course of several decades.', 'In the absence of a last-minute negotiated settlement between Washington and Brussels, the tariffs will kick in on a medley of products that range from Scotch whisky, to French wine, Spanish olives and Italian cheese.', 'The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) that adopted the arbitrators’ Oct. 2 ruling is essentially the WTO’s general council, and consists of all WTO members.', 'The U.S. had requested the emergency meeting at the WTO’s headquarters on the shores of Lake Geneva, and the outcome was always going to be “in practice a foregone conclusion,” according to Joshua Paine, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute in Luxembourg, who focuses on international adjudication law.', 'That’s because of the DSB’s “negative consensus” rule, whereby any WTO member that wants to block a ruling must persuade all other members, including the country that initiated the complaint, to join it in voting against the decision.', 'According to the trade official’s account, the U.S. ambassador Shea said it had always preferred a negotiated settlement but that it hoped the countermeasures that take effect later this week would “encourage the EU to agree to a genuine cessation of its WTO-inconsistent subsidies and the adverse effects that flow from them.”', 'The outgoing European Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, told CNBC earlier this month that she had offered the U.S. fresh proposals on civilian aircraft manufacturing, and in a statement she had also said that if the DSB were to authorize the countermeasures, as was the case today, any U.S. decision to move forward with them would be “short-sighted and counterproductive.”', 'Airbus insists that it is now fully compliant with previous WTO rulings, and said it expects another WTO panel to confirm that compliance is complete before the end of the year.', 'Last week, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned that if American tariffs take effect on Friday, Europe will not have “any other choice but to also take measures.”', 'And so soon after a temporary truce between the U.S. and China began to appear possible, the economic implications of a fresh trade confrontation has been raising concerns among European government officials and investors alike.', '“The risk of a U.S. trade conflict with the EU continues to loom large,” said Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at the German private bank Berenberg, in a Monday research note.', 'Under the WTO’s definitions, the arbitrators’ ruling on Airbus is not a “punishment” and instead is a “remedy,” but next month the U.S. may also seek to impose separate and more controversial penalties on European auto manufacturers, predicated on a view that they represent a threat to U.S. national security.', 'The findings of a U.S. Commerce Department investigation had paved the way for that option to target European car imports, though Trump decided in March to offer more time for negotiations between the two sides.', 'The White House’s ongoing dispute with China has taken center stage since then though, and consequently little progress has been made between the U.S. Trade Representative’s office and the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch that oversees the bloc’s international trading arrangements.', 'At some point next year WTO arbitrators are expected to rule against Airbus’ U.S. rival Boeing, and U.S. tax concessions that have made it difficult for Airbus to compete with Boeing aircraft sales.', 'The level of countermeasures allowable in that ruling may be equivalent or even exceed those granted this month to the U.S., and European officials say that is what makes the imposition of U.S. tariffs ahead of that Boeing ruling unreasonable.', 'But experts insist that Trump is simply following a well-trodden path, and any U.S. administration would have taken similar advantage of the situation.', '“The EU has no negotiating leverage right now,” according to Rambod Behboodi, a partner at law firm King & Spalding LLP that focuses on international arbitration. “And it will not have any strength in negotiations until that Boeing arbitration ruling.”', 'Separately, the main dispute enforcement mechanism at the WTO is also likely to fall apart in December, when term limits will mean the membership of the organization’s court of last resort, the Appellate Body, shrinks from three to one. It is designed to have seven members, but the U.S. has in recent years vetoed all potential nominations and term extensions.', 'That could also prove problematic for the European Union as it seeks to strengthen its position in future discussions with the U.S. Public hearings scheduled at the WTO in early November will focus on yet another strand of the transatlantic trade dispute, the existing tariffs on steel and aluminum that were similarly enacted under national security criteria, and which the Europeans have also argued are not appropriate.', 'The U.S. could theoretically appeal any ruling against it that relates to those metal sanctions and, without an operational Appellate Body, that appeal would act as a de facto veto. This would mean the Europeans cannot legally retaliate within the WTO framework unless an alternative dispute mechanism can be formulated in the next few months.']",-1

9,2019-09-29T14:30:19+0000,"['In 2013 serial entrepreneur Nate Saal was at a chocolate tasting in Palo Alto, California, when it dawned on him that chocolate — like coffee, the other beloved “bean” from the equator — is something consumers could be making for themselves at home. On the spot, he hatched the idea that would become CocoTerra, a countertop appliance now in final testing phases that turns roasted cacao nibs into refined chocolate bars in roughly the time it takes to watch “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.”', 'The path from aha moment to finished product shows how much tinkering, sweat and careful alliance-building goes into bringing new technology like this to the $103 billion global chocolate market, particularly when you’re an industry outsider. Saal knew next to nothing about chocolate other than enjoying the taste.', 'Educated at Yale in molecular biophysics and biochemistry, he established his career developing and licensing software platforms at various Silicon Valley start-ups. But even after launching and selling highly complex products to companies like Cisco Systems, building a chocolate-making “robot” would require a significant learning curve.', 'It started with tons of YouTube videos. “I spent a year educating myself and taking classes on chocolate-making, chocolate chemistry, the physics of chocolate-processing equipment and also learning about growing, pruning, harvesting and fermenting cacao,” Saal says.', 'Making chocolate from nibs typically takes at least 24 hours and a fleet of finicky, expensive machines. But Saal — an avid DIY hobbyist and amateur beekeeper and winemaker — believed he could speed up the process for making chocolate by grinding, refining, conching, tempering and molding in one unified system. He says, “The technology around producing chocolate hasn’t changed in 150 years, and I thought, ‘Well, why not?’”', 'The U.S. market for premium chocolate alone in 2018 was close to $3.9 billion, according to Mordor Intelligence. Often referred to as “craft” chocolate, these mostly independent brands produce in smaller batches with emphasis on sustainability and conscientiousness about sourcing finer ingredients with fewer additives from cacao bean to bar. Though six global conglomerates, including Mars, Nestle and Ferrero Group, manufacture most chocolate consumed as candy, this smaller sector of craft makers is growing the fastest in a larger market already thriving.', 'According to Zion Market Research, global chocolate revenues are expected to reach approximately $162 billion by 2024, growing at an annual growth rate of around 7% between 2018 and 2024.', 'Tapping into that stream took patience and schmoozing skills. In late 2015, Saal brought on Karen Alter, a highly regarded start-up strategist and Intel veteran who is now CocoTerra’s chief operating officer. Together they began pitching angel investors at events that brought in the first checks. A contact Saal met at one gathering introduced him to noted design firm Ammunition (known for Beats headphones and the Café-X robot coffee bars).', 'Says Alter, “They were really excited about what we were building, believed in the product and wanted to help bring the first chocolate maker to market. It was the first big financial commitment for us as a company but was an important early engagement.” Ammunition became CocoTerra’s design partner early in 2017. “After lots of concepts, ideas and trials,” Saal says, “the answer to my question about the possibility of making chocolate at home was yes.”', 'The initial response from the chocolate trade wasn’t quite as affirmative. “I thought they were totally crazy when I first talked to them on the phone,” says John Scharffenberger, the San Francisco Bay Area-based vintner and chocolate maker behind Scharffen Berger Chocolate, the company credited with starting the American craft chocolate movement in the late 1990s. Hershey acquired Scharffen Berger in 2005 for around $10 million.', 'The CocoTerra team approached the industry godfather-like figure essentially as a cold call, and their risk paid off. “I saw the machine, met the management team and the engineers, and, most importantly, tried the chocolate, and went, ‘Geeze, Louise! This is really good,’” says Scharffenberger, who is now a CocoTerra investor.', 'During a private demo last June at a cooking school in Santa Monica, Saal turned several scoops of nibs into snappy solid chocolate in just under two hours. CocoTerra’s design breakthrough is a refining mechanism that uses stainless steel ball bearings to grind nibs into the tiny building blocks of chocolate. An active cooling system controls the temperature during the essential tempering process, which transforms liquid chocolate into solid form. The device also has a spinning centrifuge to dispense and mold chocolate into a unique ring shape of approximately 250 grams that can be broken up or eaten whole.', 'A companion app guides users step-by-step and includes recipes to tailor-make chocolate down to choosing the origin of the bean (as with coffee and wine, different cacao regions produce distinct flavors) and the cacao percentage (lower is sweeter).', 'Rather than positioning themselves as a David in an industry of chocolate Goliaths, CocoTerra chose to ingratiate themselves and work from within. Early on, Saal and Alter joined the Fine Chocolate Industry Association to meet and learn from various experts. They solicited advice at classes, and attended important chocolate events like the Northwest Chocolate Festival to establish relationships with farmers, chocolate makers and suppliers.', '“The chocolate industry, especially at the craft level, is very open and collaborative, as is the consumer tech industry,” Alter says. “People are excited about their craft and are happy to share learnings with new players. We went to chocolate, food and food tech conferences, worked our own networks, took advantage of most invitations that came our way. One thing leads to another. You just need to be willing to put yourself out there and be respectful of others’ knowledge and time.”', 'The company also chooses not to limit consumers to one specific chocolate brand or supplier the way, say, Nespresso does with its coffee pods. “It was never, ’Hey, look out chocolate world, we’re coming after you,” says Alter. “Our attitude was partnering with us is good for everyone. We’re raising awareness about a chocolate-making process that everyday consumers don’t know much about.”', '“As an industry, I think we are always up for new ideas that are shown to work, but a good story without proof doesn’t get very far,” says Greg D’Alesandre, Cacao Sourcerer of Dandelion Chocolate, another early tester who overcame skepticism and is now a CocoTerra collaborator. “The thing that impresses me most is how knowledgeable and driven Nate and his team are. They had an interesting basic concept with the vision to follow through and overcome whatever challenges came up.”', 'CocoTerra does not yet have a release date, though a source with knowledge of the company said the first units should be available by next year’s holiday shopping season. The plan is to sell direct to consumers at first with hopes to partner with retailers such as Williams-Sonoma over time. Saal says the company has raised more than $2 million in investments from “people who are excited about the potential for a table chocolate-maker, either because they love chocolate, or have relevant experience in related industries--food, wine, cacao--or have worked with us before, or just believe we can make it happen.”', 'Now the test will be whether home consumers are ready to add another make-it-at-home gizmo alongside their ice cream and bread makers. For success on a large scale, some analysts say CocoTerra will need to partner up beyond the smaller craft chocolate market, with a company with global reach, such as a Nestle.', '“I anticipate some niche appeal among chocolate and cocoa enthusiasts initially, but significant market traction is unlikely unless a top six chocolate player acquires or licenses the technology,” says Oliver Nieburg, sustainable food and drink analyst at Lumina Intelligence, referring to the big confectionary conglomerates. “That said, an at-home artisan chocolate maker may offer consumers an alternative to the conventional sugar-laden candy bar.”', 'Even after five years of R&D and the jitters that come with going all-in-one on a single product, one simple thought keeps CocoTerra going: “People love chocolate,” Saal says. “The enthusiasm for it is off the charts. If we can add to that enthusiasm by getting consumers more involved in this passion, we’re no longer in the chocolate business. We’re in the happiness business.”']",-1

That’s better than modern White House history would suggest.', 'Stocks have not done that well at the outset of new presidential terms.

But it’s worth reviewing what has been expected and what has been surprising about the direction in the stock market during Trump’s first 100 days, especially at the sector level. ', 'Energy had outshone nearly every sector during the early days of the past five presidential administrations. And when presidents are more energy-centric than others, it has helped. Not in Trump’s case. While energy stocks rose 11.4 percent in the first 14 weeks of President Bush’s new administration in 2001, and 11.3 percent in 2005, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) is down more than 6 percent since Jan. 20.', '(Source: CFRA)', 'Trump’s administration still looks to be positive for energy — especially traditional sources, including oil and gas. But oil prices — after a big recovery in 2016 — have been the culprit in a falloff for the sector. For investors who think the sector is attractive, CFRA recommends XLE as the broadest way to catch any energy gains. It invests more than 46 percent of assets in what Morningstar classifies as “giant” stocks, including global oil players like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The fund is low-cost and highly liquid.', '“If you are a believer in patterns based on past performance, then diversified sector ETFs are a good way to get exposure,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. Vanguard Energy (VDE) is another broad energy ETF featuring the same top three oil stocks, but assets are also diversified among exploration companies. ', 'More from ETF Strategist: The investing blind spot that causes US investors to miss outInvesting like Buffet without even knowing itThe Trump trade is now second fiddle in the world', 'Given that Trump wants to drill for more oil, the iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF (IEO) could still be a beneficiary of the new administration. It includes more U.S.-focused drillers, like ConocoPhillips and EOG Resources, as well as refining plays like Phillips 66.', 'Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research, said the SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) is similar to IEO, with a mix between exploration stocks and refining stocks that is about 75 percent to 80 percent/15 percent to 20 percent, but it has lots of smaller-cap stocks, so it’s more volatile. XOP has near-30 percent of its holdings in small-cap names, while for IOE the percentage of exposure to small-cap stocks is under 10 percent.', 'The price-to-earnings ratio of IEO is 17.43; for XOP the P/E ratio is 25. Five of XOP’s top 10 holdings have a market cap of roughly $5 billion or below, including Chesapeake Energy, currently its largest holding. None of IEO’s top 10 holding have a market cap less than roughly $19 billion.', 'The materials sector — which includes chemicals, paper and mining — has been another of the more consistent sector winners in recent history of new administrations. Materials stocks were strong performers in 2016, too. Rosenbluth pointed to the broad materials ETF that represents the S&P 500 materials subsector, the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB). Its main holdings include high-profile merger targets Dow Chemical, DuPont and Monsanto. “Company consolidation is taking place and driving prices higher,” he said.', 'And it has done OK, though the sector has trailed the broader market, up close to 1.3 percent since Jan. 20, according to Morningstar.', 'The smaller, SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME) mainly owns steel companies, like U.S. Steel, ripped after Trump’s election, but since he actually assumed office, it has declined by near-9 percent. U.S. Steel is down 13 percent since Jan. 20 — though its near-50 percent gain in the past year still looks good.', '“It could be a beneficiary of increased steel demand from U.S. companies,” Rosenbluth said.', 'Mishra also likes the smaller, Van Eck Vectors Steel (SLX), which has international holdings like Rio Tinto. “Trump is talking about building infrastructure,” she said, “so materials companies will do well.” It is also down more than 9 percent since Jan. 20.', '(Source: CFRA)', 'Technology has historically lagged other sectors at the beginning of new term — with Obama’s first term as an exception. Many pundits expected tech to trail under Trump as a global manufacturing and trade war rattled supply chains. That hasn’t happened — Trump has even toned down talk about NAFTA revisions and did not follow through on campaign rhetoric calling China a currency manipulator.', 'Trump did make overtures to tech CEOs under the guidance of his Silicon Valley backer, venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Technology stocks would also benefit if corporate profits held offshore, were allowed to be brought back to the U.S. on a preferential tax basis. Many big technology companies are big dividend payers. That would help explain tech stocks being up so much since Jan. 20, though there are indications tax reform will take longer than initially expected.', 'The Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) has generated a return of more than 6 percent since Trump took office, according to Morningstar. Its biggest holdings include stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which are among the tech companies that have had rising dividend payouts.', 'Market analysts were more positive on health care after Trump’s win because Hillary Clinton had been more vocal about drug pricing. While Trump made plenty of comments about drug costs and at his first press conference in six months, on Jan. 11, the then-president-elect even said drug companies have been getting away with murder, investors haven’t been fazed.', 'As for Obamacare and the health sector, also lots of talk and a major Trump failure, but little negative effect on stocks. The Health Care SPDR (XLV) is also up near 6 percent since Jan. 20.', 'Keith Lerner, chief market strategist for SunTrust, said health care will continue to be faced with headline risk that can result in price swings for the sector, but he pointed out that health care was the worst performing sector in 2016. He thinks any additional headline risks will create opportunities to buy on the dip.

Over the next decade, he turned that passion from a parking lot hustle into one of the first craft beer bars in Columbus, Ohio.', 'Castore eventually sold his bar to focus on brewing and co-founded Seventh Son Brewing Co. in 2013. There were about seven breweries in the Columbus area when Seventh Son opened, Castore said. Today, there are 55 in central Ohio. Nationwide, the industry has exploded from about 1,500 craft breweries in 2000 to 7,450 in 2018.', '“We got a hockey-stick growth to brewing industry right now,” said Bill Nootenboom, president of Stout Tanks and Kettles in Portland, Oregon. “The way people are consuming beer is changing — they’re doing it in neighborhood taverns.”', 'But independent craft brewers are increasingly concerned about headwinds as President Donald Trump’s tariffs increase prices on everything from aluminum cans to brewing equipment.', '“There’s really likelihood that fewer brewers can open,” said John Watt, founder of Stout Tanks and Kettles. “These are start-ups that a lot of the time are borrowing money from an uncle or parents. Darn near everything they need to buy is going to be impacted.”', 'The problems started for craft brewers more than a year ago, when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum in March 2018.', 'Castore says the price he pays for an aluminum can has increased from about 15 to 18 cents to about 19 to 24 — depending on how the can is treated.', 'Between Seventh Son and his other brewery, Antiques on High, Castore’s business produces about 7,000 barrels and sells 800,000 cans of beer a year throughout Ohio. He estimates increased can prices are costing him about $16,000 a year. For now, Castore hasn’t passed that on to consumers, but that will change if aluminum can prices continue to increase. “If it goes up another 20% we’ll have to figure something out — we can’t just keep eating it,” he said.', '', 'Castore isn’t alone. Rob Burns, co-founder and president of Night Shift Brewing in Everett, Massachusetts, says aluminum can prices have increased 16% since 2016 or about 2 cents.', 'Founded in 2012 by Burns and two buddies with about $125,000 borrowed from family and friends, Night Shift expects to brew 40,000 barrels this year or about 13.2 million cans of beer. Overall, Burns says his costs will go up by about $264,000 this year due to the increase in aluminum can prices alone.“We’re a small independently owned family business so every penny matters,” Burns said. “Not having a quarter of a million dollars is pretty significant. That’s an opportunity to create two or three jobs; that’s an opportunity to buy equipment and grow and generate revenue.”', 'The business environment for craft brewers, particularly those just starting out, is about to get more challenging. The Trump administration is imposing 15% tariffs on $112 billion of goods imported from China starting Sept. 1, including brewery equipment. Last year, the U.S. imported $35 million of brewery equipment from China.', 'Watt has helped more than 1,000 smaller-sized breweries get up and running across the U.S. since he founded Stout Tanks and Kettles a decade ago. Watt has hands-on experience on the supply and brewing sides of the industry. Before Stout, he founded Sonoran Brewing Co. in Phoenix, which he operated for about a decade before selling it and moving back to Oregon, his home state. Stout Tanks and Kettles works with start-up breweries to design equipment to their custom specifications. Stout sources its tanks from two factories on China’s east coast close to the ports. The smaller tanks that microbreweries use are labor intensive to fabricate, Watt said, and manufacturing the same equipment in the U.S. would be cost prohibitive for start-up businesses that are often family owned.', '', '“You could never afford to open a business if you had to pay double for same equipment,” he said.', 'With the 15% tariffs looming, Watt said he will have to increase prices and that means it is going to be more expensive for his customers to get into the brewing business.', '“We don’t have really big margins so the bottom line is we have to raise our prices,” Watt said.', 'Adrian Sawczuk is already running into this problem. He and his wife Dara have had plans to open a brewery in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for about two years now. Tidal Creek Brewhouse is slated as a 10-barrel operation that will make craft beverages in house. They’ve leased property and are going through the permitting and contracting process, but the tariffs have forced them to alter some of their plans.', 'Sawczuk planned to order $300,000 of brewery equipment from China. Now, he is scaling back his plans by reducing the number of fermentation tanks. He says this will reduce production from 3,000 barrels to 1,000 barrels of beer, or 66%. The brewery’s opening has also been delayed until the first quarter of 2020 and Sawczuk says he’ll likely hire fewer people.', '“That money in my mind is just an unjustified tax,” Sawczuk said of the tariffs.', 'Castore and Burns, for their part, don’t expect to take a hit right away because they operate established breweries that already made major capital investments. But Seventh Son and Night Shift do have plans to buy more equipment to keep up with demand as they continue to grow.', 'Night Shift, for example, has big plans to open a new facility in Philadelphia in 2020 that will have a 30,000 barrel capacity from day one and can scale up to 200,000 barrels.', '“It definitely factors into purchasing decisions,” Burns said of the tariffs. “We bought Chinese equipment in the past because it’s good quality and usually the fastest available equipment and often at the lowest price.”', 'Castore said Seventh Son is already putting off some purchases, such as higher-end lab equipment, as the company tightens its belt in response to the tariffs. “As we grow it will definitely affect us,” he said.', 'For Sawczuk, the abrupt increases in the tariff rates have created uncertainty that makes planning difficult.', '“It was 10%, now it’s 15% -- tomorrow it could be 20%, then it could be zero,” he said. “Uncertainty is never good.”']",-1

Ross  is a much more Trumpian figure than Lighthizer, with strong  personal ties to the president-elect (he worked on some of  Trump’s bankruptcies) and no government experience, but a shared  commitment to a GOP brand of protectionism — in Ross’s case  deriving from the small fortune he made investing in distressed  American steel producers who were temporarily rescued from ruin  by Bush-era protective tariffs.', '  Last but by no means least, Trump has tapped Peter Navarro for a  new job running something called the National Trade and  Industrial Council. Navarro is basically an anti-trade ideologue,  who, despite being a well-qualified economist, holds a view on  trade policy that essentially no one in economics agrees with.', ' Trump is creating a structure to act', '  Perhaps more important than the picks themselves is the fact that  Trump has set up a policymaking structure that should facilitate  protectionism.', '  Under the Tariff Act of 1930 (this is the Depression-era  Smoot-Hawley Tariff you may recall from history books), the  Commerce Department retains fairly broad discretionary authority  to slap foreign exporters with tariffs if they believe foreign  “dumping” is harming American businesses. At the time, Herbert  Hoover was president, a job to which he had ascended to after  serving seven years as commerce secretary under Presidents  Harding and Coolidge. That meant the then-new Commerce Department  was a high-prestige agency. In subsequent decades, however, it’s  become a bureaucratic backwater with little real policymaking  clout.', '  The true significance of Trump’s setup is he appears to be  altering that.', '  Normally the USTR’s office is bureaucratically powerful despite  its small size (this is symbolized by its physical location right  by the White House) and institutionally biased in favor of making  trade deals. Tapping an experienced trade lawyer animated by a  profound ideological and historical conviction that the GOP’s  20th century embrace of free trade is a mistake constitutes a  huge shift.', '  Meanwhile, the new Navarro-run NTIC means that protectionist  measures emanating from Commerce will be able to bypass the  interagency process at the White House that’s normally run  through the National Economic Council. The result is that even  though the traditional economic policy power jobs are in the  hands of a hedge fund manager who used to work at Goldman Sachs  and a top executive from Goldman Sachs, the structure is in place  for Trump’s team of protectionists to implement tough measures  aimed at blocking foreign imports whether or not they, or  congressional Republicans, like it.', ' Wall Street isn’t taking this seriously', '  During the fall campaign, good news for Donald Trump — like  James Comey’s infamous letter to Congress — was bad news for  American stocks. At the time, investors feared that a Trump  administration would lead to chaotic economic policymaking,  unpredictable trade wars, and other bad-for-business measures.  And when it first became apparent on election night that Trump  was, unexpectedly, going to win, stocks crashed.', '  But the market then swiftly rallied the next day and closed out  2016 with a boom.', '  Investors anticipated that Trump would slash corporate income tax  rates, which has the near-automatic effect of boosting dividends  and therefore share prices. They also foresaw a policy regime  friendlier to fossil fuel extraction and likely to sharply reduce  regulation of major financial institutions, meaning those sectors  in particular boomed.', '  Concern about trade wars, meanwhile, rather suddenly vanished. We  haven’t seen, for example, investor concern that Boeing’s ability  to sell planes abroad will be profoundly compromised by foreign  governments retaliating against American companies. But even  though the United States runs, on net, a trade deficit, we do  export a great deal around the world — especially airplanes,  agricultural products, financial services, high-tech products,  entertainment, and pharmaceuticals.', '  Investors’ complacency in this regard may be warranted. Despite  Trump’s rhetoric, small-scale trade wars have been a fairly  common fact of life in recent administrations. Bush was embroiled  in a years-long dispute with the Canadian government over imports  of softwood lumber, and his administration slapped massive  tariffs on imported French cheese to retaliate against European  objects to exports of American hormone-treated beef. The Obama  administration slapped tariffs on Chinese tires years ago, and  hit Chinese steel earlier this year. A dispute between the United  States and the European Union about bananas managed to drag  through the Clinton and Bush administrations only to be resolved  shortly after Obama took office despite the fact that neither the  US nor the EU grow bananas.', '  These various trade controversies have all been big deals to the  workers and companies directly affected, but none of them has  been significant on a macroeconomic level because the basic  tit-for-tat structure of tariff and retaliatory tariff has  prevented any of them from impacting really major industries.  It’s certainly possible that the Trump era will bring more of the  same — big talk about protecting American jobs followed by  climb downs when it turns out that American jobs can also be put  at risk by retaliatory measures.', '  Maybe the same will be true under Trump. But Wall Street  certitude about this is a little difficult to understand. Trump  certainly seems to be laying the groundwork for a serious effort  to curtail foreign imports into the United States, and nothing  about his personality suggests that he’s likely to back down  quickly in the face of countermeasures. The exact consequences of  this are difficult to predict, precisely because nobody’s really  tried anything like it in the modern era. But based on his picks  and his clear belief that trade controversies are good politics,  it seems much more likely than not that we are about to find out.', '', ' Commentary by Matthew Yglesias, a writer at Vox.

', '  In May, Pacific Crest analysts wrote that “differentiation”  of iPhones through marketing and a glass-like appearance “are  more sustainable differentiators than technology, in our view,  because they appeal to consumers’ vanity and desire for  status.”', 'More screen space and shapes', '  Thanks to innovations in screen technology, phones can now have wraparound screens, like the OLED screens used by the  Samsung Galaxy Edge series. Several reports have indicated that  Apple may move toward these more colorful screens. ', '  Samsung and Apple may eventually move to new form factors like scrolls, or foldable devices, and may experiment with different shapes, wrote Gene Munster, now a venture capitalist but then a senior research analyst at Piper  Jaffray. Glass could help accommodate new shapes and provide a clear casing for a wraparound screen. ', 'A push toward augmented reality', 'Apple CEO Tim Cook has already indicated his interest in augmented reality. Glass is see-through — which means a glass iPhone could potentially have transparent panels to augment reality, in combination with some of Apple’s new camera technology. This idea may seem out there, but Apple has already patented covers that leave both the front and back panels of an iPhone exposed. ']",102

And if you don’t own a car and want an  imported specialty item — say, Australian beef —  chances are you reach for your mobile device, place an  order and have the food delivered. Some Chinese shopping patterns  are roughly analogous to New York City living, which can be driven by how much you can carry on  public transportation.', '“Make no mistake: Although the pace is  slower and the course is bumpier, consumption growth is still  tracing a staggering trajectory,” according to BCG’s analysis.', '  Taking a macro view, Chinese leadership has encouraged phasing  out low-end exports in favor of the high-end manufacturing and  the service sector, which can encompass retail, hotel  accommodation, finance and real estate among other industries.', 'Hoping to chase more high-end manufacturing, some Chinese companies have already built manufacturing  plants — from the ground up — on U.S. soil.

And yet  commentary from around the world suggests almost no outside  investor or economist believes Beijing’s figures.', '  Although there has never been definitive evidence that Chinese  economic data is exaggerated, the widely-held theory says that  China’s National Bureau of Statistics will overstate growth in a  stability-minded effort to hide the truth about a slowing  economy. So instead of relying on government reports,  China-watchers analyze other metrics for a more complete  picture of the country’s GDP.', '  “Nobody knows for sure, but when we look at things that are  harder numbers to fudge...our estimate is growth probably about  3.5 percent versus roughly 7,” said Gary Shilling, president of  economic research firm A. Gary Shilling and Co.

And if you have the components, which would add to the  total, why are they not publicly available?” Straszheim  asked.', '  Strategies vary for divining China’s actual GDP, with some  economists parsing Beijing’s reports for what they think are  likely grains of truth, or even analyzing economic data  from important  trading partners like Australia. Commodity prices —  particularly copper, iron ore, and to some extent oil — are another  popular way of assessing Chinese growth.', '  For his part, Shilling said his firm models China’s possible GDP  growth on measures of rail traffic, electricity consumption, coal  consumption and debt. ', '  Billionaire distressed asset investor Wilbur Ross, meanwhile,  told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that he sees China’s actual growth at  about 4 percent on a similar basket of metrics.', '  The “reason is that if you look at physical indicators —  rail car loadings, truck loadings, cement consumption, steel  consumption, exports, natural gas consumption, electricity  consumption — none of those are consistent with 6.8 or 6.9,”  he explained.', '  Straszheim said his group uses data from sources it regards as  largely independent from government pressure, pointing to  commodity consumption among other measures.', '  But most of these indicators seek to measure the share of China’s  economy based on exporting, manufacturing, and capital investment  — and Beijing has made no secret that it sees the country  shifting toward an increasingly service-oriented economy. That could, in turn, potentially make it even harder for investors to  know the truth about China’s GDP.', '  “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out the growth in  old China for the past year or so has been somewhere around zero — it’s nothing like 6.8 percent,” Straszheim said, explaining  that the “new” China of services and consumer spending is tough  to measure in the absence of robust data from the private  sector.', '  Even international businesses operating in China find it  difficult to assess the state of the Chinese economy, according  to Roger Altman, founder of investment banking advisory firm  Evercore Partners.', '  “The business leaders I speak to invariably say ‘I don’t know  whether China is growing at 4 percent, or 5 percent, or 6  percent. I really don’t know despite having extensive business  there,’” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”', '  Derek Scissors, a scholar for the American Enterprise Institute,  pointed out that China’s own official numbers seem to contradict  one another.', '  For example, China’s Xinhua  reported that November railways cargo fell 15.6 percent  year on year, but the state statistics office said industrial  production through the year was up 6.1 percent. “What? Did they  just produce the goods and leave them on the factory floor and  they never went anywhere?” Scissors asked.', '  For insight into how much Beijing may be massaging its data,  Scissors said he is looking at reconciling official reports of a  15.4 percentage point increase in consumption’s share of GDP (to  66.4 percent) with reports on the state of manufacturing and  investment.', '  If China has made such significant strides in rebalancing, then  “old” China is doing worse than officially acknowledged —  and, conversely, the shift in economic drivers would have to be  less than the NBS says if manufacturing and investment are  actually at the reported levels, Scissors said.', '  Scissors puts the GDP figure at less than 4 percent: Much lower  than China says, but higher than the no-growth implications from  external indicators like import demand or money flight.', '  “All these calculations are kind of a joke, right?” he  acknowledged. “But if you use their domestic numbers as they  report them, there are some obvious contradictions, and if you  try to massage them, they all massage downward.”', '  But it’s important to remember that GDP is just a transaction  figure, and it does not necessarily represent the health of an  economy, Scissors said, explaining that Chinese income levels are  likely better measures on that front.']",1

The index is off around 47  percent from its 52-week high of 5,166.35, set June 2015.', '  “It is therefore high time for policy makers to come up with a  convincing package to support growth, one that includes greater  fiscal expansion, continued monetary accommodation and necessary  reforms to improve the supply side of the economies,” HSBC said.', '  Supply-side reforms were one option, including tackling  over-capacity in state-owned sectors and deregulating utilities  and service sectors, HSBC said. The bank expects details of  measures on these fronts to be released over the coming month in  the lead up to the National People’s Congress in March. ', '  Indeed, HSBC cited official data that showed the iron and steel  sectors had already seen 1.4-1.5 percent of their capacity cut  last year, with further cuts likely on the way.
