He cited examples of hires Hadrian has made from Chick-Fil-A or Walmart, with no prior experience manufacturing parts.', '“We’re getting to a point where they’re making spaceflight hardware within 30 days of joining Hadrian,” Power said.', 'Hadrian is pairing those newly minted machinists with those who have extensive experience in the field or in software, having hired talent from the likes of Meta, Stripe, SpaceX, and others.']",-1

The sector lost an average 1,333 jobs a month in 2016.', 'But ADP’s private sector payroll data, which includes March, is even stronger. It shows an average of 31,000 jobs a month were added in the first quarter, the best three-month period in the history of the data series, going back to 2006.', '“I think we’re probably seeing the best of the growth [in manufacturing] right now. We had a really good past three months and probably have a good solid three months to go. I think by the end of the year, it will be softer,” said Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi, who added that he doesn’t expect a decline, just a slowing rate of hires.', 'Economists are expecting the unemployment rate to remain at 4.7 percent for March, and average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.', '“Manufacturing is healing. It should be healing. It’s a shadow of what it was. The manufacturing sector, after being bludgeoned last year, is coming back. That’s good, but it’s not booming,” said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. Swonk said more manufacturing jobs in the mix could also mean higher wages, and there could be an upside surprise to the 0.2 percent growth expected in average hourly earnings.', '“Going from positive to negative alone is huge. You don’t even need big gains. It just stopped being a drag. The steel industry is starting to come back. Mining has bottomed as well,” she said. Swonk said the increase in U.S. rig count, which started rising with higher oil prices, has resulted in an increase in oil production activity, and that has ripple effects into steel and other sectors, like trucks.', 'Of the 235,000 jobs added in February, 28,000 were in manufacturing, a sector that had added only 7,000 jobs year-over-year. There were 8,000 mining jobs added that month, bringing total hiring in the sector to 20,000 since it hit a low in October.', '“The trade balance is stabilizing and we’re starting to export a bit more. The global economy is on firmer ground. The value of the dollar is more stable. Manufacturing took it on the chin when China stumbled and the dollar rose,” said Zandi. He noted that the trade-weighted dollar gained 15 percent between mid-2014 and mid-2015, which had repercussions on trade and corporate profits.', '“The economy has stabilized, and the dollar found its footing. That’s reflected in better exports, better trade balance, and that’s been a big plus for manufacturing,” he said.', 'Zandi said there was a reversal of an earlier big increase in product inventories that stalled manufacturing activity. Another positive has been the surge in auto sales last year. Economists, however, believe those sales have peaked after cresting at an annualized selling pace above 18 million vehicles in late 2016.', '“They’re weakening now, so as we move through the year, that’s not going to be the source of growth. It’s not going to be the source of new jobs, as it has been. Sales have peaked,” he said.', 'Construction has been a strong area for hiring, with 177,000 jobs added in the past six months according to government data.

Goods-producing [industries] were losing lots of jobs a year ago. They’re adding jobs. That’s why the [government] jobs numbers are holding up as well. The services numbers have been doing what they’re doing,” said Zandi.', '“It is kind of interesting from the political angle. That’s where Trump is focused: coal, mining, energy. If you look at that today, it’s working. There’s a difference between causation and correlation,” he said.', 'Zandi, whose firm crunches ADP’s payroll data using ADP data, said he expects to see a strong non-farm payrolls number, above 200,000 jobs. ADP reported 263,000 in its private sector payrolls report Wednesday, but a number of Wall Street economists said they were retaining their much lower forecasts because of potential weather impact in the government data.', 'JPMorgan economists said they were expecting 140,000 payrolls, and UBS said they are expecting 155,000. Goldman Sachs economists expect 170,000 payrolls, and say that their forecast could have been 30,000 to 60,000 higher were it not for the winter storms in March.', 'Zandi said one of the differences in the ADP data, is that it counts as employed those workers who are on the payroll but can’t make it to work due to weather. The government data, however, will not count a worker who does not show up to work for a week due to weather, if they are not paid.']",-1

In fact, tariff hikes are really tax hikes.', '\u200e Some of those 5 million jobs will be put in harm’s way. And if they sell less to foreigners, the trade deficit goes up, not down.', 'Since so many of the things Americans consumers buy today are made of steel or aluminum, a 25 percent tariff will likely get passed on to consumers at the cash register. This is a regressive tax on low-income families.', ' Trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs, because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always deliver an unhappy ending.', 'The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 signed into law by Republican President Herbert Hoover gave us, and worsened, the Great Depression.', 'Richard Nixon’s 10 percent import surcharge contributed to the stagflation of the 1970s.', 'George W. Bush tried to save the steel industry by imposing tariffs on steel and If those tariffs worked, we wouldn’t be having this discussion today. \u200eWe tried to save the color TV industry with protectionist measures and instead they wiped out the domestic production.', 'We aren’t persuaded by the Trump administration claim that we need to impose these tariffs for national security reasons. Despite stiff competition from imports, many specialty steel producers are doing just fine and actually exporting steel to Mexico and Canada.', 'Meanwhile, Canada is the number one exporter of steel to the United States. Does anyone really believe Canada is a national security threat to the U.S.?', 'What does worry us that Canada and Mexico are now both threatening retaliatory tariffs against America. This tit-for-tat trade breakdown could put NAFTA in serious jeopardy. That could inflict severe economic damage to all three nations, and a stock market meltdown.', 'Trump should continue to make American producers more competitive in global markets through tax, regulatory, energy, and other pro-America policy changes that bring jobs and capital back to the United States. That is happening at a furious pace right now as Trump has made America almost overnight the best and most reliable place in the world to invest. Steel and aluminum import tariffs work decisively against this goal.', 'Ronald Reagan in the 1980s invoked anti-dumping provisions against Japanese steel. It was one of his few decisions he later confessed he wishes he hadn’t made. \u200eTrump will come to learn the same thing, and we hope it is sooner, not later.', ' Kudlow, Laffer and Moore are cofounders of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity.

Can that entrenched trend be reversed?', 'A growing number of market experts believe the answer is yes. “I’m very optimistic,” small businessman Drew Greenblatt told CNBC’s “On The Money” in an interview. “We’re going to see an American manufacturing renaissance”  Greenblatt, chair of the National Association of Manufacturers and president of Baltimore-based Marlin Steel Wire Products, pointed to policies that Trump wants to enact as a potential catalyst to new hiring.', '“We’re talking about reducing regulations by 75 percent, cutting our tax rate from 40-something percent to 15 percent,” he said.  “It’s just going to make America more attractive to bring back opportunities to our country,” he added. However, in industries such as apparel, more than 97 percent of clothing and shoes are made overseas. Given the entrenched economic realities, others are skeptical that any government policy can spark a manufacturing rebound  “There’s not much that can bring most of those jobs back, ” retail consultant Jan Kniffen told CNBC in an interview.  “We haven’t made patterns in America, we haven’t made the product in America forever,” he said.', 'Kniffen added that the U.S. “would need factories, but those factories would have to be so automated, the jobs would be maintaining the equipment not producing the product.” That is because “the cost of producing abroad is so low and shipping not that much,” he said.  Greenblatt remained optimistic that at least some sectors could see a resurgence. ” I acknowledge some industries are not coming back here, it makes more sense to do it elsewhere. But things like making airplanes and bulldozers and cars, it’s going to grow here, it’s going to thrive here.”  Greenblatt’s Marlin Steel exports to 39 countries from its Maryland factory. He told CNBC that the company designs and fabricates wire baskets for automotive clients including Toyota Motor and General Motors.  “We make baskets for Caterpillar and Boeing,” he said. “These companies are building factories in America, growing factories in America and they’re poised for big expansion as these policies improve.”  Kniffen, however, sees a longer timeline.', '“I think what he just described is a 15- to 20-year program if you could do it in terms of training,” he said.', 'However, both men cited a significant lack of trained workers to fill available jobs. In a 2015 report, the Manufacturing Institute said that over the next decade, more than 3 million manufacturing jobs would need to be filled as current workers retire or move on to other jobs. However, because of the decline in necessary skills, barely a million of those positions will be staffed, in part because fewer students are receiving the necessary training in schools.  “There is a significant skills gap”, Greenblatt said. “We need schools to be teaching math, English, the STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] educations. These things are critical to create the talent pool so we can hire these people.”  Another trade change the Trump administration is considering is the border-adjustment tax, as part of an effort to fund a border wall with Mexico. The proposal would place a 20-percent tax on all goods imported into the U.S., but outgoing American-made goods would not be subject to the tax.   Kniffen told CNBC he was “conceptually” is in favor “of a cross border tax,” but cited significant risks. Some experts say a border tax would be passed on to American consumers, and may result in the loss of jobs in certain sectors. “I think it would bring back jobs, and we would get exports,” he said. “But in the short term the disruption would be enormous, my retailers would all go broke...and we wouldn’t bring those (retail) jobs back. ”  Kniffen added it “could be a net positive long term”. But “in the short term, it could be very painful.”', 'On the Money airs on CNBC Saturday at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets. ']",-1

I think we’ll get at least a 25 basis point cut. I’m thinking we’re not going to get 50 basis point cut...The Fed has been burned when it’s been bold,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust.', 'Roth said he believes the market is already pricing in a quarter-point cut, and he does not see the Fed’s rate cut as much of a longer-term catalyst for stocks. If it trims by a half percentage point, he expects just a short-term pop.', 'Economists believe the Fed will cut interest rates even though recent data has improved. That’s in part because Powell has stressed the Fed is focused on the global economic slowdown, trade wars and low inflation, and that it will do what it takes to keep the economy expanding.', '“The only real catalyst that would really help the market would be if there was a trade deal with China,” Roth said. “I think the likelihood of that is less than 10%. We’re very pessimistic on the possibility of a real deal with China prior to the [2020 presidential] election.”', 'So, in the void ahead of the Fed’s meeting, the market will be watching earnings.

If growth comes in as expected, it would be the first quarter where growth was under 2% since the first quarter of 2017. Economists are watching to see how consumer spending fared in the quarter, after a recent pickup and also whether business inventories are declining.', '“The data we need is not Q2. What’s at risk is the growth and magnitude of the Fed rate cut. I don’t think Q2 is going to have much impact on the Fed’s thinking,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It’s really how Q3 is progressing. It seems to me the economy softened in April and May and picked up in June with jobs data, retail sales and manufacturing sector.”', 'Chandler said investors will also be focused on the European Central Bank, which some economists believe could cut its overnight deposit rate to negative 0.5% from negative 0.4% currently when it meets Thursday. Chandler said odds are about 50% for the rate cut, which many also expect in September.', '“While we’re waiting for the Fed to figure out whether it’s 25 or 50 basis points, and we’re waiting for the ECB to get all its forms sorted out ... the emerging markets are pushing ahead,” said Chandler, noting Russia and Turkey could cut rates in the next several days, after similar moves in the past week by South Africa, South Korea and Indonesia.', '“It just makes the story more global. You’re seeing the trade numbers from China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea weaken. You’re seeing exports form China suffer. Exports from all of Asia are suffering,” he said. “The big surprise for China and Japan has also been on the import side. The declines in their imports is really someone else’s [drop in] exports.”', 'Dollar strength has been a consequence of the trade war, and Fed action could help turn it around.', '“If the Fed fails to move, you’re going to end up with an increasingly stronger dollar,” which impacts corporate earnings, Roth said.', '“The dollar is quite strong and is increasingly going to be a headwind for U.S. companies. It hasn’t appreciated that much in 12 months, but if we see a divergence in monetary policy between the U.S. and the rest of the world, you would see a carry trade develop where people would want to buy assets in the U.S.,” he said.', 'The dollar index was slightly higher on the week, but Wall Street has been focused on President Donald Trump’s negative comments on the currency’s strength.

During a hearing in March before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Lighthizer raised eyebrows among some lawmakers when he raised his voice at Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and dismissed her concerns about the administration’s trade policies as “nonsense.”', 'Jim Lighthizer said that his brother has found a rare kindred trade spirit in Mr. Trump, one who has empowered the trade representative to make the kinds of changes to the balance of international commerce that he always dreamed of. After decades as a Republican “voice in the wilderness,” he has now embraced his role as a blunt-talking “bulldog” who is empowered to carry out the president’s goals of pressuring countries to lower their trade barriers.', 'Although Mr. Lighthizer does not traffic in the bombast of his boss, he is well schooled in the art of the deal. In the 1980s, during a deadlock in negotiations with Russia over wheat policy, he presented his counterparts with a tally of the costs of traveling to and from Moscow and told them that if a deal could not be reached, he would not return. At that point, they came to terms.', 'That approach could come into play as the United States and Canada struggle to hash out their remaining differences.', '“In negotiations, you’ve got to be willing to pull the trigger and blow it up,” said Jim Lighthizer, a former Democrat in the Maryland State Legislature, who communicates almost daily with his brother. “If he tells you he’s going to do something, expect it to happen.”']",1

It showed that the unemployment rate was at 6.1% — significantly higher than the 2.7% registered in the last survey period between July 2011 to June 2012.', 'Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate came in at 36.9%, with a disproportionately lower percentage of women looking for work during the survey period. That number was comparatively lower than many other OECD countries.', 'The government argued that the numbers should be seen in isolation as they were derived using a new methodology.', 'But at least one economist expressed concern.', '“It is a very worrying trend,” Sanjay Mathur, chief economist for Southeast Asia and India at ANZ bank, told CNBC. He explained that there were several long-term trends that contributed to the relatively high unemployment figure.', 'First, growth in the business process outsourcing industry — a key source of employment in India — has slowed over the years as more companies shift to cheaper places like the Philippines. Business process outsourcing refers to instances where a company outsources non-essential operations to a third party.', 'The construction sector, another source of jobs, also weakened in recent years. Finally, Mathur said, India’s poor infrastructure set-up means the country cannot tap into opportunities that opened up when China exited a number of labor-intensive activities to modernize its economy.', 'In the short-term, the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017, and the unexpected currency reform a year earlier, also hurt many small- and medium-sized firms — and some had to shut down or retrench part of their workforce. That, Mathur said, also contributed to the unemployment figure but the situation is expected to be rectified in the coming years.', 'The latest employment data showed some Indian states fared better than others.', 'In states like West Bengal, unemployment was 4.6% — below the national average. But other states like Kerala, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu had relatively higher figures of 11.4%, 9.7%, and 7.6%, respectively.', 'The varying levels of unemployment in different states were a concern for some economists even before the latest jobs data were released.', '“There are very serious variations when you go from one state to the other,” Shamika Ravi, director of research at Brookings India, told CNBC in New Delhi in April. Ravi explained that it is the business climate in individual states that drive job creation, more so than policies implemented by the central government in New Delhi. “State-level policies have huge implications for local conditions,” she added.', 'For Sankalan Dutta, a telecommunications engineer working for Vodafone in Pune, those local conditions pushed him to seek employment opportunities away from Kolkata, the capital city in West Bengal, where he was working for about six months at the start of his career.', 'He told CNBC he started looking for better opportunities as the first job he had was not something he wanted to do. When one became available in Delhi, he moved.', '“Today, the (job) I’m working on is not available in Kolkata,” he said. “Even if it is available, it is very low in number. It’s very difficult for me to find a job in Kolkata that fits my profile.”', 'Overall, he said, it’s become harder to find the right kind of jobs in India’s IT industry. “It’s not like I’m at the same skill level. I’m continuously upgrading my skills. Still, it is getting difficult,” Dutta said.', 'Anurag Sarkar, an assistant professor at the Future Institute of Technology in Kolkata, echoed those sentiments. About 30% to 40% of the graduates from his civil engineering department get recruited right after graduation, he said. But many of them end up working in areas like sales and business processing, or at call centers, even though they are trained as engineers.', '“Their motivation drops,” Sarkar told CNBC in Bengali. He explained that those jobs get them so-called “easy money” where they’re able to earn a salary with little effort. It is detrimental to their long-term prospects, said Sarkar, adding that West Bengal needed more large-scale industries — such as manufacturing and steel — to drive private-sector job creation.', 'Many people who are unable to find jobs also end up starting small businesses.', 'Economists agree that better policy decisions are required — both at the central and state levels — to improve the conditions needed for job creation in India. In many instances, state governments can follow a different agenda than New Delhi, even if members of the same party are in charge.', 'Modi’s second term as prime minister looks set to be defined by his ability to pass tough, controversial reforms on the country’s labor and land laws. The expectation is that if those changes come through, it would potentially improve India’s global competitiveness, growth and create more jobs.', 'India is a services-driven economy but the country has a large pool of low-skilled workers who are better suited to do low-end manufacturing jobs, according to Priyanka Kishore, head of India and Southeast Asia at Oxford Economics. But those labor-intensive sectors are not growing and current laws work against the so-called economies of scale, she said.', '“It is in the benefit of an industrialist to actually have a smaller set-up than run a large factory,” Kishore told CNBC.', 'She explained that if existing laws can be changed to encourage labor-intensive industries to scale up, it would generate more employment. That said, Kishore felt it’s likely that the Modi government would initially focus on fixing the more pressing problems, including rural distress, before working to pass tough reforms to generate long-term employment.', 'For their part, states can implement policies to improve the quality of workers available by investing in better education for potential employees, according to ANZ’s Mathur. “It is not possible for a central government to ensure that education outcomes are good or favorable.”', 'He added that after the GST was implemented, state governments now enjoy a relatively larger share of tax revenue and there’s a case for them to “step up investment in infrastructure.”', 'Modi, for his part, has formed two high level cabinet committees that will be tasked with tackling the twin economic challenges facing India right now — unemployment and a slowdown in growth.']",1

Both aim to advance human progress and focus on start-ups they can mentor with their companies’ own technical expertise and market know-how.', '“Our goal is to get a window on innovation,” says Scott Darling, president of Dell Technologies Capital, who notes that Michael Dell reviews every single deal the fund invests in. “We need to plug into the external entrepreneurial ecosystem. This is so important, since the pace of technology is stunning.”', 'As Darling explains, the ROI on successful start-ups is so large that the dollars flowing into these ventures by investors has boomed. That’s because the market for these technology products is typically huge. In Dell Technologies’ case it has invested more than $600 million in about 100 investments over the last six years. Of these, there have been 40 exits and five IPOs, with a combined market value of over $50 billion, including Docusign, Cylance, MongoDB and Zscaler.', 'More from At Work:Perhaps money can buy you happiness — at least at workA third of US workers seriously considered quitting their job in the last 3 months. Here’s why', 'Nagraj Kashyap, corporate vice president and global head of Microsoft’s M12, a venture fund focusing on enterprise software, AI, cybersecurity and cloud computing, agrees. “Innovation isn’t limited to our corporate boundaries. It is an exciting time to see how AI is transforming the workplace. Already we see it becoming more distributed, more flexible and diverse.”', 'The success quotient for these corporate funds and the companies they invest in has been high for a key reason. Dell and Microsoft invest in companies they can help make commercially viable and often plug them into their product development, sales and distribution networks. This helps start-ups gain product adoption— and a first-mover advantage.', 'For example, Microsoft has partnered with corporate education start-up GO1.com after its venture arm, M12, led a Series B round investment of $30 million last June. The Australian start-up that emerged from the Y Combinator accelerator is the Netflix of training. GO1.com offers a SaaS subscription service that plugs into any software platform, allowing HR departments to tap 50,000 training courses — everything from compliance and leadership training to IT skills — in multiple languages for their workforces.', 'GO1.com is growing its service 300% annually, according to co-founder and chief operating officer Chris Eigeland. Its product has been integrated into the Microsoft Teams chat software, along with Microsoft Dynamics 365 enterprise resource planning and CRM software. This has helped the four-year-old start-up garner 1.5 million learners and more than 1,500 customers worldwide.', '“The biggest challenge employers face today is in reskilling and finding the right piece of training to suit their particular needs,” says Eigeland. “Advances in technology, a more transient workforce and a focus on specialization by profession are the trends we are seeing.”', 'Matthew Carroll, CEO of Immuta, a data governance start-up in Maryland that attracted funding from Dell Technologies in its $20 million Series B financing last year, also believes that employees are being swept up in a whirlwind of change. The company that is run by former U.S. National Security Agency techies has developed a method to govern how data is used by machine-learning algorithms without breaching privacy laws.', '“Very soon in the future, I believe every employee will have automation tools and they will be data analysts doing their jobs every day,” he says. Right now the speed at which companies are adopting AI, machine learning and data analytics is posing a serious risk.', '“Companies need to ensure data is being used appropriately and privacy is being respected without breaking any government regulations,” he says. “Machine learning is booming, and we still don’t know the long-term consequences of it yet.”', 'The companies that do this best will be able to attract the best talent. “Millennials are going to want to work for employers that use data responsibly. This will be a big issue for employees,” says Carroll, who contends that as a former intelligence operative, he looks at the world through a safety lens.', '“We think of our product as a control layer that determines who [man or machine] should see or use company data,” he says. Immuta’s SaaS enterprise platform connects to any data source in the cloud or on premises through any tool so data scientists don’t have to write code or copy the data. It lets legal teams build rules and controls onto the data so they maintain regulatory compliance.', 'Carroll sees a $30 billion market for automating data governance as machine learning goes mainstream in corporate America. According to Gartner, global business value derived from AI will reach a staggering $3.9 trillion by 2022. Yet legacy forms of data management for AI are counterproductive and not advanced enough.', 'That is why Dell is looking at potentially licensing the software and then bundling it with its own product offerings to sell to OEMs.', 'Using AI to empower an organization and boost efficiency is another area that start-up’s like Noodle.ai are targeting. The San Francisco-based start-up provides AI-as-a-service, explains Noodle.ai CEO Stephen Pratt. The company, which attracted $35 million in a venture capital round led by Dell Technologies Capital and TPG Growth last year, builds a customized in-house platform for clients called the Beast, which serves as the Office 365 of AI applications for general business purposes. It improves inventory and energy management, manufacturing and the supply chain.', 'Noodle.ai engineers and data scientists build three-component machine-learning systems that consist of a sensory engine that finds patterns in data, a prediction engine that calculates what’s likely to happen in a business, and a recommendation engine that surfaces actions to meet objectives. Results selected from the recommendation engine are fed back into the system, starting the cycle over.', 'The start-up’s clients include XoJet, one of the world’s largest private aviation platforms; and American steel producer Big River Steel. In XoJet’s case, Noodle.ai produced a learning algorithm that takes into account thousands of variables to determine the right prices for airfare, which boosted the company’s profitability by 5%. And for Big River Steel in Arkansas, it used more than 30,000 sensors and AI to predict how much electricity would be consumed by the mill’s machines so it could sell excess energy back to the electric company.', '“Empowering companies to be radically more efficient and supercompetitive is what we do,” Pratt says.', 'That is important for any size company but becoming harder as the talent crunch worsens — especially in emerging fields like AI and automation.', 'Recognizing the shortage of data science professionals, M12 invested — and Microsoft later acquired — Bonsai, a start-up that helps engineers, even those without AI expertise, build their own artificial intelligence models and incorporate AI into their business. Using what Microsoft calls a machine-teaching approach, it “abstracts … low-level mechanics” to enable engineers to specify and train autonomous systems to accomplish tasks in a virtual environment.', 'The huge market potential led Microsoft to integrate Bonsai’s technology into its own AI development toolset last year. It is now part of its autonomous systems group.', '“This technology is important, since so many companies are adopting AI and need to teach these systems,” says Mark Hammond, co-founder of Bonsai who is now general manager of business AI at Microsoft.', '“It allows companies to develop their AI capabilities without having to hire AI engineers as market demand grows,” says M12′s Kashyap.', 'Customers piloting the product now include Schneider Electric, Shell and Toyota.', 'As Kashyap points out: “AI will dramatically change the workplace over the next 5 to 10 years.

One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.', 'Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed’s quantitative easing programs. “We’re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,” he said.', 'Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. “Part of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it.

SWEAP boasts a 91 percent conversion rate to full-time employment at GE upon graduation, with 24 SWEAP graduates hired so far.', '“One of the things we’re hearing is kind of a departure from the traditional training method,” says FastStart executive director Paul Helton. “Companies nowadays don’t have that leisure where they can spend three, four weeks training someone, so we’re developing a lot more information-on-demand [like videos for special tasks]and really utilizing mobile devices, trying to do more on-the-job training that is a lot more effective and gets people out to the floor much more quickly.”', 'While swiftness might be a hallmark of FastStart, the long view is just as important. “We can custom-make the workforce that’s required, but we just don’t say ’Have a nice day” and walk away,” says Pierson. “We see these as long-term engagements.”', 'In the Shreveport area in the northwest part of the state, for instance, the state created a worker pipeline for pipelines: The $22 million Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering Technology at Bossier Parish Community College attracted German steel manufacturer Benteler to build a seamless steel pipe mill, the first most advanced of its kind in the country.

For the industry’s hundreds of thousands of workers, the bigger worry is their jobs.', 'Though West Texas Intermediate crude has only plumbed its new lows for about a week, some are already warning that energy workers could see layoffs sometime soon if oil doesn’t rebound.', '“A sustained drop in oil prices would cost the sector 50,000-75,000 jobs if employment returned to its low from a few years ago,” Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income, wrote in an email to CNBC.', '“During the downturn in 2015/16, U.S. employment in the oil sector fell by about one-third.

That, in turn, led the Saudis to cut their own prices and fanned fears of a global price war. WTI was trading Tuesday at $27.89 a barrel.', 'But trying to guess the size of future layoffs — or any lasting economic impact — is a trickier process, especially given the magnitude of the fall and lingering questions over Russia’s eventual cooperation with OPEC.', 'Historically, big declines in the price of oil tend to have a mixed impact on Americans. Quick sell-offs followed by equally quick rebounds can keep the impact to a minimum, but more sustained swoons can have real economic consequences.', 'On the upside, a fall in oil prices usually leads to cheaper gasoline at the pump and offers the vast majority of U.S. consumers the freedom to spend their cash elsewhere.', 'President Donald Trump voiced that optimism on March 9, when he touted the decline in oil as a catalyst for American consumer.', '“Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil.

Lofty oil prices courtesy of OPEC’s stronghold on global supply and a relative inefficient American supply chain kept prices above $100 a barrel.', 'But as the U.S. grew more focused on its energy independence and improvements to the production of shale oil, North American production began to reach critical levels. Combined with geopolitical rivalries among OPEC members and softer demand from a decelerating Chinese economy, the global glut in oil led to an eventual plummet in oil prices.', 'The damage was both large and size and persistent as WTI crude prices sank from its yearslong range above $100 a barrel to a low around $36.60 between August 2014 and January 2016.

64,2018-03-31T18:29:26+0000,"['Tony Bowling is 52. He was born, raised and still lives in Hazard, Kentucky, a small town in the southeastern corner of the state, deep in the heart of Appalachia’s coal country. Like many of Hazard’s roughly 5,300 citizens, he hails from a long line of coal workers. “Every male on both sides of my family, going back at least three generations, worked in the mines,” said Bowling, himself an underground miner for more than 10 years.', 'But like so many miners in Hazard, surrounding Perry County and throughout eastern Kentucky, Bowling was laid off, another victim of the coal industry’s steady decline nationwide, especially over the past decade.', '“The TECO Coal Corp. mine I worked for completely shut down,” he said, recalling identical fates with two other mining companies he’d worked for until being laid off. “I finally said enough is enough.”', 'That was in 2012. Two years later, still looking for a steady job, Bowling signed up for a 10-week training program at Hazard Community and Technical College (HCTC) to earn certification as an electrical lineman. He’s been working, aboveground instead of below it ever since — just not in Hazard. His job has taken him to Ohio, Florida, Maine, North Carolina and now to Puerto Rico. “I’m making more money now than I ever did in the mines,” he said, adding that he’s also an instructor in the program on weekends.', 'Bowling’s story is emblematic of the boom-and-bust history of the coal industry in Appalachia, a largely rural 13-state swath that runs from southern New York to northeastern Mississippi. And while he successfully switched careers, thousands of fellow miners in and around Hazard are unemployed, despite numerous job-training initiatives such as HCTC’s lineman program.', '“We’re still dealing with the aftermath of layoffs in the coal industry,” said Michael Cornett, director of agency expansion and public relations of the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program, a nonprofit, federally funded workforce development organization established in 1968 and headquartered in Hazard. “You don’t recover from the loss of 13,000 coal industry jobs [in eastern Kentucky] since 2011 overnight.”', 'Today only seven companies produce coal near Hazard, including Blue Diamond Coal, ICG Hazard and Cumberland River Coal. During the industry’s heyday, dozens of companies operated mines in Perry County. In 2008 the region produced 17 million tons of coal annually. It dropped to about 4.1 million tons last year.', 'Layoffs topped out in 2016, when the state’s coal industry slumped to its lowest point in 118 years, according to a report by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. The number of jobs statewide dropped by nearly 1,500 during just the first three months of that year, or 17.9 percent, leaving an estimated 6,900 employees in the industry. Eastern Kentucky lost 21.6 percent of its coal jobs during the quarter, while the drop in the state’s western coalfield was 12.2 percent. The last time Kentucky had so few coal jobs was 1898, when they averaged 6,399, the report said.', 'Today’s unemployment rate in eastern Kentucky ranges from 9 percent to 12 percent, said Jared Arnett, executive director of Shaping Our Appalachian Region, a nonprofit agency formed in 2013 as a coordinator for economic development and job creation resources in eastern Kentucky. “But the real number that speaks more to the problem is the labor participation rate,” he stated. “We run at about 44 percent, while the national average is 70 percent. That’s the crux of the challenge.”', 'It’s no secret that the U.S. coal industry has been struggling for years. Industry advocates often blame the Obama administration’s “war on coal,” specifically two signature policies to reduce fossil fuels’ carbon emissions — the Clean Power Plan, which never went into effect before the Trump administration moved to eliminate it altogether, and the Paris Climate Agreement, from which the United States has withdrawn.', 'A majority of economists, business and energy analysts instead agree that coal’s demise is due to a triple whammy: competition from much cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas, proliferated by fracking technology; growth in the solar and wind energy production; and tougher environmental regulations. In Appalachia coal production fell by nearly 45 percent overall between 2005 and 2015, according to a recent analysis by the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development agency established by Congress in 1965. As a result, since 2011 the entire region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs.', 'Hardest hit has been eastern Kentucky, which has endured the highs and lows of the coal marketplace for more than 100 years. Times were best when mining wide veins of high-sulfur, bituminous coal close to the surface was cheap and demand was high, and worst once miners had to dig deeper and demand dropped. Literally the fuel of America’s Industrial Revolution and growth, coal has fallen from providing more than half of the nation’s electricity as recently as 2000 to 30 percent in 2017.', '“Coal is only viable to extract when the price is very high,” said Chris Bollinger, an economics professor and director of the Center for Business and Economics at the University of Kentucky, which recently published the 2018 Kentucky Annual Economic Report. “It’s not now and hasn’t been for a while, and it isn’t likely to recover.” Plus, he noted, because coal from western states, including Wyoming — by far the nation’s top coal producer — is considerably cheaper than Appalachia’s, “even if there’s a big resurgence in demand, it’s not likely to be for Kentucky coal.”', 'At the same time eastern Kentucky is striving to employ out-of-work miners through a mix of local, state, federal and private programs, communities are dealing with endemic poverty, opioid abuse, aging infrastructure, environmental issues and a deficient K–12 education system. Other single-industry areas, such as Detroit and Pittsburgh with their auto and steel industries, respectively, have fallen on hard times. But whereas those cities generally rebounded, Hazard continues to whirl in an imperfect storm of circumstances, both natural and man-made.', 'Although jobs are in precious demand, a deep-rooted spirit of resilience abounds. “There is still a lot of hope in the region,” said Jennifer Lindon, president of the Hazard Community and Technical College, one of several entities tasked with not only developing a non-coal workforce but also attracting other businesses and launching whole new industries. She grew up in Hazard and returned after earning a Ph.D. at Mississippi State University, so she shares the local pride and heritage surrounding coal. “We had bumper stickers that said, ‘Coal Is King.’ I am not against coal.”', 'Yet Lindon also acknowledged the deleterious impacts of that legacy. “We knew we needed to diversify our economy,” she said, “but for whatever reasons we did not.”', 'The human toll is high unemployment coupled with a lack of opportunity for jobs nearby, although several manufacturers are planning new facilities within a couple hours drive from Hazard. Briady Industries, near Ashland, aims to open a state-subsidized $1.3 billion aluminum rolling mill by 2020, with the promise of more than 550 jobs. Silver Liner has said it will employ 50 people to assemble tanker trucks in Pikeville when its operations begin later this year. Last December, EnerBlu, a California-based advanced battery maker, announced plans to erect a $412-million gigafactory in Pikeville — on the site of a shuttered coal mine — slated to launch in 2020 and employ up to 875 workers.', 'In the meantime, HCTC offers training programs designed to put unemployed miners back to work right away. The most successful has been the lineman course Bowling completed. “We’ve trained around 186 people, mostly miners, in the program,” Lindon reported, “and we have a 90 percent placement rate.”', 'There’s a hitch, however. Most of those jobs are out of town, requiring linemen to be on the road during the week and travel home on weekends. Some jobs are even more demanding. Bowling, for instance, spoke to CNBC.com by phone from Puerto Rico, where he’s working for 120 days helping to repair the electrical system hit by Hurricane Maria.', 'HCTC has had to reconsider some of its workforce curriculum, recognizing a catch-22 that frustrates many community and technical colleges. “Should I train 100 people in advanced manufacturing when I don’t have a manufacturer in my area?” she said. “Or if I train them, does that mean [Hazard] will be more attractive to industry?”', 'Further complicating matters is that many miners, particularly older ones, lack college degrees, an unintended consequence for decades of landing good-paying mining jobs right out of high school. That excludes them from transitioning to careers that require high-level STEM degrees, so HCTC’s automotive, welding and HVAC certificate courses are popular.', 'Another persistent obstacle, said Cornett, ties back to Hazard’s coal culture. “From an outsider’s perspective, it’s a dirty, dangerous job, and how can anyone do it? From here, though, mining is not just a vocation, but an avocation,” he explained. “There’s a sense of pride and purpose, and nothing to be ashamed of. To see the industry downturn tears at the cultural roots of how people perceive themselves and where they live, because it pulls the rug out from underneath you.”', 'More from @Work:', 'The hot job market for workers over 50Silicon Valley reeling as Trump chokes a source of tech talent', 'The challenge, Cornett said, is to get miners to see themselves in a different light, and to reimagine how to take the skills they have and apply them to another occupation. Heavy-equipment operators, truck drivers, mechanics and engineers from the coal industry may be able use their know-how in a variety of businesses, including the fledgling drone industry that’s emerging in Hazard. “We’re trying to get the region as a whole to see itself not as it was, but what it can become.”', 'The region’s remoteness and mountainous geography have curtailed installation of broadband internet, creating a vexing impediment for a host of work options, as well as preventing companies from moving here. That’s why SOAR has made building out a high-speed network a top priority among its partners.', 'For example, broadband is essential to EKCEP’s Teleworks USA initiative, which prepares people for remote call-center work with companies located almost anywhere, either from home or one of eight wired hubs set up around the area. “Since January 2015, we’ve placed about 1,400 eastern Kentuckians in such jobs,” Cornett said. Training takes two weeks, and starting pay is $10 an hour; the newfound income has infused $30 million into the local economy, he added.', 'Computer coding schools across the country have been touted as a quick way for those without college degrees to get high-paying jobs, but only if they’re available. When a couple of former coal workers launched Bit Source, a software and web developer, in Pikeville in 2015, there was buzz about the region becoming “Silicon Holler.” The company hired 10 former miners as coders, trained through a EKCEP program called TechHire East Kentucky — from among 900 applicants.', '“We want to connect with employers who have real job opportunities that we can train people to fill,” said Arnett of such conundrums. “We’re finished with the ‘train and pray’ approach. So we’re building relationships with outside companies that will hire people from our region to work in our region.”', 'Make no mistake, though, there are still hundreds of coal miners working in Hazard and Perry County, including nearly 200 for Cambrian Coal Group, part of Booth Energy in Debord, Kentucky. “About 75 percent of what’s produced in Hazard is thermal coal,” said Cambrian president Mark Campbell, which is used in power plants, a dwindling market. Cambrian’s mines are also a source for metallurgical coal, an essential ingredient in steel manufacturing, a sector expected to benefit from President Trump’s recent 25 percent tariff on imported steel. “We’re optimistic that will create demand for our [metallurgical] coal,” Campbell said, but it’s too soon to predict if it will translate into new jobs.', 'What all this portends for the future of Hazard remains to be seen, though there’s little doubt that King Coal’s absolute reign is over. The consensus seems to be that the industry — and the culture it’s engendered — are too entrenched to completely disappear, nor will coal mining jobs, but certainly not enough to sustain the community. There’s widespread hope, too, that the many efforts to retrain former miner workers and to prepare the next generation for a variety of different careers will lead to the town’s survival.', '“Everybody realizes that nothing we do can change where the coal industry stands,” Arnett said. “I have neighbors and friends in the industry, and some still have jobs. But they also see their children and grandchildren leaving, and realize that other options are not a bad thing.”', '— By Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com']",-1

But some economists expect consumers to become a stronger force in the second quarter and make up for some of that.', 'Emanuel said he expects the  which surpassed its previous closing high of 2,930, in the past week, to reach a high of 3,000 this year. The S&P is up more than 3% in April so far, and earnings season has been mostly positive for stocks.', 'The S&P 500 gained 1.2% in the past week, closing Friday at 2,939, just under its all-time intra-day high of 2,940, from Sept. 21. The Nasdaq was up 1.9% for the week at a new closing high of 8,146. But the Dow was down 0.1% for the week, ending at 26,543, still 1.5% below its intra-day high.', 'The first quarter earnings season was expected to be the first negative quarter for profit growth in three years, but as of Friday, earnings growth looks to be flattish, based on actual numbers for companies that have already reported and estimates for others, according to Refinitiv.', 'According to Emanuel, the coming week’s earnings will be important, and now there are reports from big pharma. He said health care has become more attractive to him as it has come under pressure this year.', '“If you look at the rebound, that is only four months old, the easy money has been made and the easy money has been made in technology,” he said. “From our point of view, we like the places investors have had a more difficult time.” He said two of those sectors are health care and financials.', '“With regard to technology there has been an element of performance chase that has crept into the market,” he said.', 'Technology, since the start of the year, has been the best performing of the major S&P sectors, with a gain of 26%. Financials are up 18.4%, and health care is the worst performing sector, up just 2.5%', '“If you think about part of the reason the health care sector has been under such intense pressure recently, it is the expectation that legislatively, not only are prices rising less, but you could also have an element of deflation in that sector. Our view point is that is not likely to materialize,” Emanuel said. “We see the weakness in healthcare as much more a function of the majority of the universe is frightened by Medicare for all, and those that aren’t are frightened by the prospect of the Affordable Care Act being repealed. We don’t see either of those happening.”', 'Emanuel said he’s currently being selective in buying stocks, especially given risks to the market like unresolved trade talks between the U.S. and China; the slowdown in Chinese stimulus and weaker growth, particularly in Europe.', 'Monday', 'Earnings: Alphabet, Restaurant Brands, Loews, CNA Financial, Continental Resources, MGM Resorts, Canadian National Railway, NXP Semiconductor, AK Steel, Ethan Allen, Leggett and Platt, Texas Roadhouse, Transocean, Molina Healthcare, TrueBlue, Vornado Realty Kemper, Diamond Offshore', '8:30 a.m. Personal income/spending', 'Tuesday', 'Fed begins two-day meeting', 'Earnings: Apple, Amgen, Merck, Pfizer, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips, Mastercard, McDonald’s, Arconic, Corning, Encana, Eaton, Seagate Technology, Blue Apron, Chubb, Ingersoll-Rand, HCA, KKR, Vertex Pharma, Akamai, FireEye, Groupon, Advanced Micro, Mondelez, Samsung', '8:30 a.m. Employment cost index', '9:00 a.m. S&P/Case Shiller', '9:45 a.m. Chicago PMI', '10:00 a.m. Pending home sales', 'Wednesday', 'Monthly vehicle sales', 'Earnings: BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Clorox, CME Group, Estee Lauder, Royal Caribbean, Humana, Hilton, AMC Networks, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Sealed Air, Entergy, Johnson Controls, Yum Brands, Qualcomm, Host hotels, Allstate, American Water Works, Apache, Hartford Financial, Square, Suncor, Williams Cos, American Financial Group, Metlife, Marathon Oil, Cheesecake Factory, Fitbit, Owens-Illinois', '8:15 a.m. ADP employment9:45 a.m. Manufacturing PMI 10:00 a.m. ISM Manufacturing 10:00 a.m. Construction spending 2:00 p.m. Fed statement 2:30 p.m. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell briefing', 'Thursday', 'Earnings: Dow, Volkswagen, Delphi Automotive, Shake Shack, Tableau Software, Weight Watchers, U.S. Steel, Discovery, Kellogg, PG&E, Generac, Dunkin Brands, Wayfair, Under Armour, Cigna, Church and Dwight, Sotheby’s, Gilead Sciences, Activision Blizzard, Yeti, Schneider, Kimco, Expedia, Monster Beverage, Motorola Solutions, Fluor, Con Ed, Eldorado Gold, Beazer Homes', '9:30 a.m. Initial claims8:30 a.m. Productivity and costs 10:00 a.m. Factory orders', 'Friday', 'Earnings: Adidas, Fiat Chrysler, TransCanada, American Tower, HSBC, Nordisk, Dominion Energy, Noble Energy, CBOE Holdings, Equinor', '8:30 a.m. Employment9:45 a.m. Services PMI 10:00 a.m. ISM nonmanufacturing', 'Saturday', 'Earnings: Berkshire Hathaway']",-1

As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.', 'Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.', 'The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.', 'Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first.', 'There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.', 'This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and the power of American pride.', 'In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade -- the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.', 'In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.', 'In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.', 'We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.', 'But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.', 'Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future. The decision is ours to make.', 'We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.', 'Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.', 'Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.', 'In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.', 'Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.', 'We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.', 'We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.', 'We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty -- and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.', 'My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.', 'We have unleashed a revolution in American energy -- the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.', 'After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.', 'On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone -- almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.', 'If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!', 'We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.', 'This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.', 'Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.', 'In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.', 'And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population -- and far beyond.', 'Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing -- and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.', 'In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence -- and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.', 'When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.', 'Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.', 'We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.', 'As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.', 'The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.', 'Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.', 'As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.', 'This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.', 'Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.', 'No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.', 'Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.', 'Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.', 'Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.', 'Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.', 'The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in.', 'Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.', 'I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.', 'Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.', 'To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.', 'Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.', 'In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.', 'We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.” Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.', 'Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement -- and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.', 'My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.', 'It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall -- but the proper wall never got built. I’ll get it built.', 'This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.', 'San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.', 'The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.', 'Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.', 'As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.', 'No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before -- and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.', 'As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.', 'To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount -- reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.', 'We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.', 'Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods -- and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us -- I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.', 'Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.', 'I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried -- until now.', 'Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- or USMCA -- will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.', 'Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.', 'Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.', 'I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.', 'The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.', 'Already, as a result of my Administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.', 'But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.', 'I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.', 'No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.', 'Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.', 'Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: “Last Day of Chemo.” Grace -- you are an inspiration to us all.', 'Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.', 'To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.', 'There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.', 'To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.', 'Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God.', 'The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security.', 'Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military -- with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.', 'As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.', 'Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.', 'For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.', 'Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.', 'As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.', 'Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.', 'We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.', 'Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.', 'One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.', 'Our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.', 'Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.', 'As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.', 'When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.', 'Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.', 'I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.', 'In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.', 'Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole -- and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.', 'We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.', 'My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.', 'To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.', 'We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.', 'Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery -- but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.', 'Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall -- more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah’s 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah’s family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: “It’s the Americans.”', 'A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. “To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.”', 'I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight -- seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.', 'When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.', 'They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.', 'Why did they do it? They did it for America -- they did it for us.', 'Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.', 'Think of this Capitol -- think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.', 'Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.', 'What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?', 'I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.', 'We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them.', 'We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance -- or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.', 'This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.nd our choice to make.

Phase two will be figuring out how these services interact with each other and traditional bundled pay television.', 'Streaming services are theoretically future replacement products for pay TV — an anachronistic bundle of linear TV networks that cost somewhere between $60 and $100 per month. There’s strong evidence suggesting the general public has begun a movement away from traditional TV toward streaming. About 80 million U.S. households still subscribe to some form of satellite or cable TV, down from a peak of close to 100 million roughly a decade ago, according to LightShed Partners, a technology, media and telecommunications research firm.', 'Then again, 80 million U.S. households is still a huge number. More Americans still subscribe to cable and satellite TV than Netflix, which has about 60 million subscribers, or any other streaming service.', 'The result makes this moment in time an awkward one for the innovation cycle. Disney, Amazon, AT&T, Comcast and Apple are among the largest companies laying the groundwork for a mass transition in media consumption, but their products also work as complements to traditional TV rather than replacements. Still, there’s an assumption that streaming services will one day function as replacements, even if the end result is a bundle of streaming services that looks like a skinnier version of traditional TV with better user functionality that’s available on all devices all over the world.', 'This pattern of innovation is fairly common, said Brian Hindo, a partner at strategy consulting firm Innosight, who works with media, technology and consumer clients. Innosight was co-founded by Clayton Christensen, author of the seminal business book “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” which details the typical effects of disruptive innovation.', 'Just as cellphones initially operated as complements to landline phones and mini mills were seen as niche manufacturing factories for low-quality steel, streaming services will be incomplete offerings until they reach scale, said Hindo.', '“When disruptive products enter a market, they typically are worse in some meaningful way relative to traditional products,” Hindo said. “Their appeal will initially be to certain segments of the market who are willing to accept trade-offs for new benefits.”', 'At this juncture, the three new benefits for streaming services are lower price, new content and mobility, i.e., access to programming anywhere on any device. The drawbacks are lack of quality content, such as live sports, and a confusing array of options, rather than the one-bundle-fits-all approach of cable.', 'If streaming products can actually get to profitability — most of the major companies are predicting they will hit this point in three to five years — they will then be able to expand their reach and improve their offerings to accelerate the demise of cable TV, Hindo said.', 'Historically, publicly traded incumbents, such as Disney and NBCUniversal, have been poorly positioned to keep up with disruptors, said Hindo. They are too wedded to profitable models to purposefully innovate against themselves with niche products that come with disadvantages.', 'Then again, Disney and NBCUniversal know this. Their executives have likely read Christensen’s book and other common business-school textbooks about how to properly pivot.', 'NBC’s Peacock is perhaps the best example of traditional media’s purgatory between innovative disruption and supplemental add-on. According to people familiar with the matter, NBC will announce an advertising-supported version of Peacock that’s free to consumers but light on content, pairing it with a limited ad version for about $5 per month and an ad-free version that has Peacock’s full offerings for about $10 per month. Comcast customers and, eventually, other pay-TV subscribers will get access to all of Peacock with limited ads for free. In essence, NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast, is giving away Peacock as a bonus to those who subscribe to traditional television.', 'Why is NBCUniversal doing this? First, Comcast is a traditional cable company that, all else equal, would like you to continue to buy cable TV. Second, NBCUniversal makes about $6 per month per subscriber for its basic cable networks, which include CNBC, MSNBC, USA, Bravo, E!, Golf Channel and others, according to research firm S&P Global. NBCUniversal makes even more on regional sports networks, of which they own nine, that can cost several dollars per month per subscriber.', 'That means new NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell stands to lose $7 to $9 per month for a given household that cuts the cord on cable. Simply swapping cable TV for Peacock, a product that’s either free, $5 or $10, is probably going to be a money-losing proposition. Burke said last year he was targeting getting about $5 per month for every Peacock subscriber in advertising revenue. That’s a great new revenue stream. It’s not a great replacement revenue stream. ', 'That may be fine and dandy for a start-up or a private company intent on pushing disruption. It’s not so fine for a publicly traded company with a shareholder base and equity analysts making buy/hold/sell decisions on quarterly earnings results.', 'So Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and NBCUniversal chairman Steve Burke came up with a different plan: treat Peacock like an add-on service, not a replacement product. Disney, arguably Comcast’s biggest rival, has leaned into the disruption by making Disney+ just $6.99 per month with a full catalog of old Disney, “Star Wars” and Marvel movies and TV shows. Yet even Disney hasn’t made ESPN available outside of the traditional bundle, opting to keep the $9 per month per subscriber fees coming instead of accelerating the destruction of cable TV.', 'As I wrote here, AT&T has arguably been the most aggressive about putting together a kitchen sink streaming offering, HBO Max, that comprises much of the best stuff WarnerMedia has to offer. But while HBO Max may be the most robust streaming service as a replacement option for cable TV, it may actually be the least appealing complement for cable TV, at its relatively high price of $14.99 per month.', 'As a result, the winners of the streaming wars will go hand-in-hand with how quickly the traditional world of television unravels. Roberts and Burke have come to the conclusion that the transition from pay TV to streaming is best for NBCUniversal if that movement is as slow as possible. That may be the biggest “reveal” from Peacock’s presentation in New York.', 'Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']",-1

Yet major companies like Boeing and Whirlpool are also finding much to like in the administration’s muscular approach to enforcing anti-dumping and other less-used trade laws.', 'The first of those decisions came on Friday when the International Trade Commission ruled that US-based solar cell makers Suniva and Solarworld had suffered “injury” from cheap imports. The finding sets the stage for the ITC to recommend by November that the president order “safeguards” — or broad-based tariffs — on all imports of solar cells, giving Mr Trump the tariff moment he is said to crave. ', 'Similarly, Whirlpool is turning to the administration to restrict imports of washing machines made by South Korean competitors LG and Samsung, which the US company accuses of waging “a relentless assault on US manufacturers\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and the thousands of American workers they employ”. Like the solar companies, Whirlpool argues that traditional anti-dumping measures targeting specific products from individual countries have failed to stop cheap imports as the South Korean manufacturers have moved production around the world to avoid US duties.', 'Boeing, meanwhile, has drawn the ire of Britain’s Theresa May and Canada’s Justin Trudeau over a more traditional anti-dumping case it has brought against Canadian rival Bombardier. Many experts expect that case to be given the green light by Mr Trump’s commerce department on Monday despite lobbying and threats from the two US allies.', 'All three cases have prompted a question: would they have happened if Mr Trump was not president?', 'Trade lawyers in Washington say his administration has been good for business and invited a flurry of inquiries from US companies which see an opening to bring complaints that other administrations might have viewed with scepticism. But other experts are more cautious.', '“These are not cases that are out of the blue. They have been trying to stop these imports for years,” says Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “But would we have seen them under previous administrations? Maybe not.”', 'The question is particularly pertinent for the “safeguards” cases launched by the solar companies and Whirlpool.', 'Such cases are rare though not without precedent. President George W Bush in 2002 used the same “safeguards” law to impose temporary tariffs on steel imports. The Obama administration in 2009 employed a similar manoeuvre to restrict imports of Chinese tyres.', 'Past administrations have also soured on such trade actions. Beyond drawing the ire of trading partners, studies have shown both the Bush and Obama decisions caused more job losses than gains. One study found the Bush administration’s steel move led to 200,000 Americans — more than were employed in the entire US steel industry — losing their jobs due to higher steel prices.', 'In opposing the solar case, other parts of the solar industry — from home panel installers to companies such as Elon Musk’s Tesla — have argued that tariffs would raise costs and threaten more jobs than they would save.', 'Supporters of Mr Trump’s tough approach counter that protecting “upstream” manufacturing jobs and industries is more important to the US’s long-run economic health than “downstream” jobs.', '“America cannot afford to lose another manufacturing industry to imports, particularly one that combines high-tech and renewable energy like the solar industry,” the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group of manufacturers which back Mr Trump, wrote to the ITC this month.', 'Yet the battle over jobs is also more complex than that.', 'On the face of it Boeing’s case against Bombardier pits a US industrial giant against a Canadian competitor. But the opposition of the UK prime minister, which is based on 3,000 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland she is eager to protect, points to the company’s global operations, and her concerns are shared by some in the US.', 'In a letter to the Trump administration last month, members of Congress from Kansas and West Virginia complained that 2,000 Bombardier jobs in their own states were at risk. They pointed out that more than half of the parts in the Bombardier C series aircraft Boeing is trying to keep out are US-made.', 'Likewise, Whirlpool’s petition has been opposed by officials from South Carolina, where Samsung in June broke ground on a home appliance factory in a move that drew praise from the Trump administration.', '“Samsung’s investment is great news for South Carolina and the United States,” Wilbur Ross, Mr Trump’s commerce secretary, said at the time. “And it is a direct reflection of the fact that America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”', 'More from the Financial Times:  Why America’s tax and trade debate is wrong   Future of US solar industry placed in Trump’s hands Millennial coffee drinkers want farmers appropriately rewarded']",-1
