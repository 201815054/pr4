The new season of the zombie apocalypse show will begin October 6, but judging from some of the negative fan reactions in recent years, one might wonder if the show can still attract enough viewers to justify renewing it.“There wasn’t one single episode or event or death that made me walk away, but rather a culmination of bad episodes, poor storytelling, repetitive narratives and an undertow that pulled us further and further away from what first brought us together,” said writer Patrick Schmidt in a Fansided article titled, “Why I’m Breaking Up with ’The Walking Dead.” ', 'It wasn’t always like this. The show premiered in 2010 and by season five, it was a ratings sensation, pulling in 17.3 million viewers, which made it the most-watched show in cable television history. It became a pop-culture touchstone and inspired a spin-off show, “Fear of the Walking Dead,” as well as a themed cruise ship getaway called the “Walker-Stalker Cruise,” with zombie-themed activities and meet-and-greets with the show’s cast.', 'Sadly, dissatisfaction with the show began to build within the fan community and intensified during season eight, when large numbers of fans gave up on the show. In a piece called “Why People Stopped Watching ‘The Walking Dead,’” Looper’s A.J. Caulfield wrote what could have been the zombie saga’s post mortem.', '“Over halfway into its eighth season, ‘The Walking Dead’ has dipped to its lowest ratings since its freshman season — pulling in just 6.8 million viewers (down from the 11.44 million who tuned in to the season eight premiere) for episode 10,” he wrote.', 'Season nine received better reviews than its predecessors, but it may have been too little, too late. According to Variety, the last episode of season nine, which aired on March 31, was the lowest-rated finale in the show’s history.“In the Nielsen Live+Same Day ratings, Sunday’s finale averaged a 1.9 rating in adults 18-49 and 5 million viewers,” Variety said. ”[I]t is down approximately 44% in the key demo and 37% in total viewers compared to the Season 8 finale (3.4 rating, 7.9 million viewers).”', 'While all of this news would seem to indicate that “The Walking Dead” is now roundly unpopular, the eulogies have all been premature. Representatives for AMC would not comment for this article, but the 10th season is indeed on its way, which would seem to imply that the network believes the show still has an audience.Beyond that, production began in July on a second, as-yet-untitled spin-off of the show  and a standalone movie is also in the works. In other words, despite many fans’ grousing, the franchise is doing just fine. So why do viewers keep watching a show that they say they don’t like anymore?According to Vassilis Dalakas, professor of marketing and chair of the Department of Marketing at California State University San Marcos, it’s because of the “sunk cost” fallacy. Viewers feel they’ve made an investment in the show and they don’t want to waste it, even if it means losing an hour of their lives each week to something that feels like a chore.', '“It is hard to give up on it on season 10,” he said. “Essentially, this would be like admitting they wasted the past nine years they had been watching this show.', 'Writer Erika Holmes, herself a fan of “The Walking Dead,” attributed the show’s ability to retain viewers to what she called “the science of storytelling.', '“When we start a story, no matter how long or short it is, it creates an ‘open loop’ in our minds,” she said. “That means our brains naturally want a conclusion. We crave closure. The only way to close the loop is to watch until the end, even if it means venting our frustrations on social media or at the water cooler the next day.”', 'Andrew Selepak, media professor in the Department of Telecommunication at the University of Florida, agreed. He said that “The Walking Dead” is retaining enough viewers to remain viable because fans want to see which characters will make it to the final episode, even if that means watching a show that they say is offering diminishing returns.', '“Rick Grimes is gone, Carl is dead, Glenn is dead,” he said. “The only reason to keep watching is to see how our favorite character’s storyline ends.“For now, that may be enough to keep viewers tuned in. It may even be enough to justify the expansion of the franchise. But Selepak said that if the overall quality of the program doesn’t improve, viewers will want nothing more from the show than its ending. “We can only watch our favorite characters wander around doing the same thing over and over before we even stop caring about that,” he said. “At some point, we just want our favorite characters to ride off into the sunset and recreate the world.”']",-1

The waters allow domestic  goods, oil and raw materials to transit to destinations around  the world.', '  Circumnavigating the South China Sea to avoid conflict would be  more expensive for shipping firms as the waters serve as part of  the most direct sea route between the Asian and European  continents. The extra distance would involve massive extra fuel  costs.', '  Simon Lockwood, deputy managing director, marine at Willis Towers  Watson believes that a shift in the balance of power in a region  like this is unlikely to have an adverse effect on trading  vessels, but added this was providing the power shift “does not  coincide with open hostilities.”', '  According to the Financial Times Monday, China’s Maritime Safety  Agency has announced that it will carry out military exercises in  the South China Sea this week, though these are expected to be  within its internationally recognized waters. The drills are  third event of this kind announced by the Hainan MSA this year.', '  Industry voices say that shipping remains currently unaffected by  the build-up of military equipment in the region. Andrew Brooker,  a founding partner at shipping insurance firm Latitude Brokers  explained that “trade routes are not affected, therefore costs  are not increased and there is very little discussion amongst  operators in the region (of disruption).”', '  Commodity markets responded apprehensively to Tuesday’s ruling  last week, with Brent crude futures rising $1 per barrel on the  news according to Reuters. But, Maersk Line, the largest  container shipping company in the world, told CNBC that their  current operations in the area are normal with no change to  existing procedures.', 'Despite inflamed rhetoric directed at the U.S. and its allies  concerning the Hague’s ruling, China said in a government  statement on July 12 that it is, “ready to work with other  coastal states and the international community to ensure the  safety of and the unimpeded access to the international shipping  lanes in the South China Sea.”', '  Though some suspect that Tuesday’s decision in favor of the  Philippines could encourage other small countries in the region  to reassert their claim to areas of the South China Sea, Godement  believes that it is China who decides the direction in which the  situation will progress.', 'Follow CNBC International  on Twitter and Facebook.']",21

L3Harris, the result of a merger of Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies, ranks among the top six defense companies in the United States.', '“This was a brilliant combination that’s created the most high-tech operator in the industry,” he said.', 'L3Harris builds military products through four segments: Integrated Mission Systems, Space and Airborne Systems, Communication Systems and Aviation Systems. The merger allows the company to invest efficiently in innovation, which mirrors the merger of United Technologies and Raytheon, Cramer said. Some of the products it makes includes radios, air traffic control systems and space hardware, and the company plans to put 4% of its revenue into research and development in actionable intelligence, war-fighter effectiveness and spectrum superiority, CNBC reported.', 'Out of the major U.S. defense contractors, Cramer thinks L3Harris supports some of the most valuable projects with its technical expertise building equipment that affixes to ships and planes. Goldman Sachs earlier this month began covering the stock, issuing a “Buy” rating with a $240 price target.', '“They think the company can beat Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates in short order, and they believe L3Harris is poised to take market share in the Pentagon budget thanks to their technology-rich product offerings,” Cramer said. “They’re in some of the strongest parts of the defense sector, both companies had strong numbers the last time they reported, and management has a tremendous track record.”', 'Buying the stock here at about $180 is a bet on management’s ability to mitigate costs, Cramer said. CEO Bill Brown, who led Harris Corp., says the combined company is “an efficient solutions provider, and 40% of our total savings are going back to the customer in the form of cost-plus contracts that drive more affordability.” In two years, he will retire and be succeeded by COO Chris Kubasik, who was chief of L3 Technologies.', 'L3Harris is laboring to integrate the companies by optimizing the supply chains and reducing overhead expenses, Cramer said. The company is also offering shareholders a 10% dividend boost and initiating a $4 billion stock buyback.', '“Man, $4 billion — that is substantial. This is only a $44 billion company ... that means they’re planning to retire roughly 9% of the share count, including more than 5% over the next year,” he said.', 'L3Harris’ stock has rose nearly $20 since it closed in early July and trades at 18-times next year’s earnings estimates. That’s more expensive than its peers like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that sell for 15-times and 14-times earnings, respectively, Cramer noted.', '“However, I think L3Harris deserves the premium because it’s the most technologically oriented, difficult proprietary defense contractor there is. It’s probably the least levered to any individual project that might potentially be cut” in case the defense budget gets reduced in the future.', 'L3Harris will present second quarter earnings in a week.', '“I like L3Harris so much that I think you should be prepared to buy it if the quarter’s confusing ... and the stock pulls back,” Cramer said. “Although, get this: I would not be averse to you buying stock” ahead of time.']",15

The basis has widened dramatically in the past year for North Dakota soy farmers, going from about 70 cents to $1 per bushel to closer to $1.55 to $2 per bushel.', '“We always have a bad basis up here because of our location,” Morken said Friday. “But we’re probably 60 cents worse than a normal year plus what the market has gone down at the Chicago Board of Trade since the trade war has gone on.”', 'Morken, who farms in Casselton, North Dakota, has harvested about a third of his soybeans and plans to store the vast majority of it to wait out the trade war. There’s always a risk the trade war could last well into 2019 and leave farmers like Morken with full bins during the next harvest.', '“If this is still going a year from now, I don’t know what happens, because I’m not going to have room for them, my elevator is not going to have room for them, and nobody is buying them,” he said.', 'Michael Langemeier, agricultural economist at Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture, said the net benefits of storing soybeans this winter are attractive right now. “There’s a strong price signal to store now, and part of that is the high yields expected from the current harvest,” he said.', 'Soy farmers in other areas, including Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, also have been adversely affected by the trade fight with China, given that the commodity has fallen about 17 percent in price on the decline in the soybean futures market since China announced the tariff. But because Midwest states are more diversified in terms of customers, the basis widening tends to be less pronounced than in the Dakotas.', 'On Monday, Arthur Cos in the Arthur, North Dakota, area had a cash bid for soybeans of $7.03 per bushel, according to data on AgWeb.com. That was 89 cents per bushel below, or about 11 percent less than, what Ramsey Grain in Rochester, Illinois, was paying for the commodity.', 'Last year, the U.S. exported about $20 billion of agricultural products to China, and soybeans accounted for more than $12.2 billion of that amount, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.', 'China buys about two-thirds of the world’s soybean exports, using most of it for soy protein to feed roughly 700 million pigs in the country or to make cooking oil. The soy also is used for feeding poultry and to support the country’s fish farming sector.', 'With the lack of Chinese demand, there’s been an effort to redirect more beans south to river terminals where the commodity can eventually be shipped out of Gulf of Mexico ports. There are reports that port terminals and elevators in Louisiana are starting to experience congestion as more farm goods move down the Mississippi River.', '“They didn’t create this superhighway to connect production in North Dakota to the Mississippi River or to the Mexican market or to the Atlantic Coast,” said Steenhoek. “Yes, there’s still a way to get there, but it wasn’t built with that in mind to handle this huge surge of production.”', 'More than two-thirds of South Dakota’s annual soybean crop gets shipped to Asia, with most of it destined for China. Soybeans are the biggest crop grown in the state, rivaling corn and wheat.', '“We were possibly too reliant on China as far as a customer,” said Todd Hanten, who grows soybeans and corn near Goodwin, South Dakota. “We’re going to have to find new customers and new uses for our products, or we’ll have to change what we grow.”', 'Hanten said about 10 to 15 percent of his soybeans are harvested but weather has led to delays. He plans to market about one third of his crop this season and expects to get extra bushels from a strong crop to help cushion the blow of lower prices.', '“Things were really good for a while, and they may be very good again,” said Daniel Kowalski, an economist and vice president of CoBank’s Knowledge Exchange division. “But for the time being, where we are with trade talks, it’s just tough.”', 'Kowalski said China may pull back in the near term but he doesn’t think they can pull back in the long term. “They still need to produce or import pork, and they need to import soybeans, because they don’t have enough land. So this is a little bit of a game of chicken now with China to see who can outlast who.”']",-1

A historically black area, it has seen a big Hispanic influx in the past two decades, with more than three out of four residents now coming from one of those two groups. It is still living down its reputation, gained a quarter of a century ago, as the murder capital of the US: one out of every 571 of its residents was the victim of a homicide in a single year.', 'Things have improved since then. But over the same period, it has become the poor neighbour to some of the world’s richest companies. In one of the ultimate signs of the divide between the haves and have-nots of the western US, the municipal government of East Palo Alto didn’t own the rights to draw more from the state’s water reserves, which it would need in order to grow. In June this year, it took a gift of cash, from the private foundation set up by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, to buy the rights from a richer neighbouring town.', 'Zuckerberg’s personal interest in the area is understandable. Immediately to the north, his ever-expanding Facebook campus looms, a shining city alongside the salt marshes of the San Francisco Bay.

A community activist who grew up in East Palo Alto, she says that it was hard to get the company to address the impact of its headlong growth. “We tried the nice way,” she says. “They shot us down.”', 'Silicon Valley likes to think of itself as a harbinger of the future: not just a model for a new economy and a new way of working, but for a new social contract. At a time when the US is in a paroxysm of tribal discord, the tech industry’s young leaders promote themselves as the vanguard of an enlightened new generation.', 'Their industry welcomes immigrants: nearly three out of every four workers aged between 25-45 and employed in technical jobs in the area were born outside the US, according to Silicon Valley Index, an annual analysis of the region. Highway 101, the artery that connects the area’s cities, spreading 50 miles to the south of San Francisco, is replete with Teslas — although, in the current boom, most are likely to be idling in a traffic jam.', 'But to judge from what’s happening on tech’s own doorstep, there is nothing to be complacent about. San Francisco itself is in the midst of a contentious spurt of growth, bringing an influx of tech workers into the city’s poorer districts and pushing out Hispanics and African-Americans. Now, Silicon Valley, where the tech industry spreads out through a string of faceless office parks, is starting to show the tension too.', 'As space-age architecture edges closer to streets where homeless people sleep in their cars, the concept of two Americas is becoming painfully visible: one whose citizens have wealth, privilege and 21st-century skills; the other in which people are surviving day to day, facing arduous commutes or insecure housing if they are to make ends meet.   The price of the median home in East Palo Alto, at nearly $800,000, is still far below prices in neighbouring towns. But it has spiked from just $277,000 in 2012, after the real-estate bust. Long-time residents are being forced out; software developers are moving in. Bennett, 30, counts herself among the displaced.', 'After losing her home to foreclosure during the housing crisis, she moved to Oakland, across the bay.

We are at a point when we have to try something new, or all of our communities are going to change,” says Bennett. “We’re walking cautiously down this path. How do we hold big companies accountable in low-income communities?”', '“People all over the world are watching what will happen in Silicon Valley,” adds Salimah Hankins, a lawyer who represents tenants at risk of being displaced by the onrush of the tech giants. “I do give Facebook some credit. They do in general terms accept the impact tech is having. But it’s been a long road.”', 'It is an uneasy cohabitation. It took a lawsuit from the city of East Palo Alto to get the social-networking company to consider ways to mitigate the effects of its whirlwind growth. The result was an $18.5m grant to build affordable housing for people on low incomes.', 'But even leveraging that up with other cash will probably bring only 200 housing units, says Carlos Romero, an East Palo Alto council member and resident for more than 35 years. Estimates put the number of new jobs — many of them low paid — that are created indirectly for each new tech worker at between two and five, adding to the housing squeeze and greatly magnifying the impact of tech expansion.', '“The narrative that has been preferred by these corporations is that it’s all because of their largesse. But they were coerced to the table,” says Romero. “When all is said and done, it doesn’t address one 150th of the impact that the size of these developments will have.”', 'After nine years, Celia Cucalon, 56, is about to be evicted from her cramped, 300 sq ft studio apartment in Burlingame, a city between San Francisco and Palo Alto. A housekeeper and carer for elderly people in the area, she had been paying $1,035 a month in rent. But her building — which has five small apartments — was sold, and a few months ago the new landlord handed her a shock: a rent increase to $2,250, along with notice to leave in 60 days.', 'The rent inflation is a symptom of the speculators who are pouring into the area to cash in on tech money, says Hankins, the lawyer who has represented Cucalon. The building where Cucalon lives was last sold in 1996, for $340,000; this year it was listed at $1.475m. The chance to “re-tenant” the building with highly paid tech workers has driven up its value. Cucalon’s neighbours included a gardener, a restaurant worker and a medical assistant. Soon, they will all be gone.', '“House cleaners, nurses, servers in restaurants — they don’t earn that amount of money,” she says. “People who are taking care of the elderly and working in restaurants, they can’t afford to live here. Who is going to clean the houses in these areas?”', 'The tech industry is already under fire for a lack of ethnic diversity. While an influx of workers from India and east Asia has fed the Valley’s need for technical talent, other minorities are severely under-represented. For the region, the housing crisis will make the problem worse. “It’s disproportionately affecting Latinos and African-Americans,” says Hankins. “It has implications not only for the socio-economic mix but racial as well.” Of the district where Cucalon lives, Hankins adds: “Is it becoming a county where only if you’re wealthy and white you can live here?”', 'The housing crisis that is forcing Cucalon out has been decades in the making. Today’s Silicon Valley was carved out of a rich agricultural land of apricot and almond orchards. At the time the tech companies started to emerge, the region’s cities followed a simple plan: bring in jobs, not houses. This development bias is part of the legacy of California’s notorious Proposition 13, the 1978 referendum that saw the state’s voters severely circumscribe the ability of local governments to increase their property taxes. With little income to be had from homeowners, towns have instead relied on other sources of income, such as sales taxes. New offices also bring cash — without the attendant need to build more schools or take on other social costs.', 'It is the formula that produced the Californian dream. A neat ranch house on a small grassy lot and a commute down the highway to work in some faceless, sun-washed office park. But with the latest tech boom — as traffic clogs the highways and a shortage of housing makes it hard even for well-paid software developers to own a home — the old dream, for many, has evaporated.', '“People laugh when you travel around the country and say we have too many jobs,” says Lenny Siegel, the vice-mayor of Mountain View, where Google is based. “It can’t go on indefinitely. But it’s not showing any sign of slowing down.” ', 'Silicon Valley has long been a place of bubbles and busts, but something has changed. It is now in the midst of a long boom that depends heavily on a handful of globe-spanning tech giants, each of them rich enough to ride out any dips. The romantic local myth still holds that the next big idea is already being dreamt up in some Silicon Valley garage. But Facebook and Google have shown themselves adept at buying up whatever dreams they haven’t been able to crush.', '“We aren’t a start-up place any more,” says Stephen Levy, a local economist, of the dominant forces driving the tech economy. “We’re a big-company-dominated place. And these companies have very deep pockets.” The latest boom, running since the real-estate crisis, has already beaten the odds, he says. “There has not been a correction here — and there may not be.”', 'In the headlong race to grow, the campuses of the tech titans are turning into sprawling empires. The developments that Facebook has on the drawing board will take the number of workers in its complex of buildings along the Bay to as many as 30,000, estimates Romero, up from around 10,000 now.', 'Google’s plans are even more breathtaking. As well as adding a major extension to its Mountain View HQ, it has rented large parts of Nasa’s Moffett airfield to the south and is spreading like a rash through Sunnyvale, where it has bought up $820m worth of properties. Next in its sights: San Jose, the Valley’s largest city, where the internet search company recently announced plans to turn a ramshackle district of warehouses and car-repair shops into an urban centre. It will hold an estimated 20,000 new workers — as many as Google currently employs in all its Silicon Valley facilities. (Facebook and Google declined to comment for this article.) ', 'But it will take years for developments like these to materialise, not to mention the new transport links on which they will depend. Among the latter is a proposed urban hub linking high-speed rail, local rail and other transport connections — the biggest such project in the western US — to support Google’s giant San Jose expansion.', 'In the meantime, a chronic shortage of housing and poor transport links have sent people into the Californian interior to find homes, and condemned many to long and expensive commutes.', 'Leslye Corsiglia, a former housing director for San Jose, says cities well inland are already feeling the effects of Silicon Valley’s boom, as house prices rise and homelessness spreads. “People are starting to talk about a Bay Area nether region that goes all the way up to Sacramento,” she says, referring to the state capital deep inland.', 'Even professionals are finding it hard to hang on. The planning department for the city of Mountain View recently had 16 new proposals before it, 13 of them to add more homes, says vice-mayor Siegel. But the department said it could not take any of the projects on: an inability to hire town planners meant it was already overworked. “We need more housing for planners,” he says.', 'These pressures are causing a political shift, and forging unlikely alliances. Siegel describes himself as the last person to take a corporatist view of the world. He attended the Democratic party’s presidential convention last summer as a delegate for Bernie Sanders. But he is now counting on an alliance with the tech industry to make up for years of under-investment in housing. ', 'With its continued expansion at risk, Google, for its part, is getting into the housing business. It wants to add nearly 10,000 new homes alongside its headquarters extension, although it faces some opposition from a city council concerned about the impact on traffic of such rapid development. ', 'There have been other new alignments of interests. In the early 1980s, Siegel was among those agitating, unsuccessfully, for Mountain View to adopt rent control, to protect its low-income workers. It turned out to be the high-water mark of California’s rent-control movement: East Palo Alto, along with a handful of major centres such as San Francisco, adopted the protections. Then the idea fell off the political map for a generation.', 'The Bay Area’s homeowners — not usually predisposed to welcome anything that might depress real-estate values — are now coming around to the idea that rent control may be a good idea after all. When their children can’t afford to live in the area and they are worried about a lack of teachers, nurses and cleaners, the concept of regulation can suddenly sound appealing. Late last year, voters in Mountain View and Richmond backed rent control. Other local cities are weighing up similar proposals.', 'Artificially holding down prices can’t, however, make up for a severe shortage. Getting companies such as Google to help fill the gap could go some way to addressing the issue. But their interventions have also raised concerns locally about the rise of new company towns under the sway of the Valley’s giant corporations, says Siegel.', 'Those fears are overblown. The housing that Google hopes to build on land it owns — like the 1,500 homes recently proposed by Facebook to go alongside a development of its own — would be made available to anyone. Fifteen per cent of Facebook’s new housing units, and 20 per cent of Google’s, would be designed for low-income residents.', 'But it will take years for projects such as these to be approved and built. And, given the sheer scale of the expansion that is planned — and the low proportion of subsidised accommodation — it will still be a case of too little, too late.', 'This points to a troubling future for America’s tech heartland. The combination of the region’s ageing, rich homeowners and a shortage of new housing will inevitably lead to a slowdown in jobs creation, reckons Levy, who runs the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. “By 2025, you won’t have a lot of 75-year-olds who are working,” he says. The Valley is already worried about the impact of greater restrictions on US immigration. Add to that inadequate development, and the dynamism that has underpinned Silicon Valley’s success could stall.', 'Robert Aguirre, a former electronics engineer, is homeless again. Now in his sixties, he refers to the condition, with a philosophical shrug, as being “unhoused”. Demand for the kind of work that he specialised in, involving the testing of communications equipment, was shipped abroad years ago.', 'He has had two longer periods without a roof over his head before, one of which lasted a year and a half. For the past month, since being evicted, he has been sleeping on the streets of San Jose in a borrowed car while trying to find new digs. He makes it sound like no big deal. “If someone complains, the police ask you to move,” he says. “If not, they leave you alone.”', 'In the Valley, homelessness has become a suburban complaint. Lines of battered RVs line certain streets in places such as Mountain View, where the courts have said they can park for 72 hours at a time. The cities don’t even enforce those relaxed rules, as they try to come to grips with an issue that has become endemic. The cars and campers of the unhoused have also started appearing overnight in the parking lots of the region’s shopping malls.', 'For some of the Valley’s low-paid workers, there are few alternatives. “It’s not your pierced, drug-dealing, bipolar, downtrodden homeless,” says Siegel. “It’s the employed.”', 'In the shadow of the tech industry’s extreme wealth, the plight of the swelling ranks of the homeless — who now number some 7,000 in Santa Clara county, by some counts more even than in San Francisco — arouses a strong reaction.', 'Critics point out that the big tech companies like to think of themselves as socially progressive, adopting moralistic mission statements that often involve changing the world — with the unspoken promise that it will be for the better. But they have failed to deal with a problem that is spreading in their own backyard.', 'Sandy Perry is a minister at a church organisation set up to tackle homelessness in San Jose. He is driven by a deep religious conviction and, invoking the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr, considers housing a civil rights issue. “If you have resources, you’re responsible for taking care of your fellow human beings,” he says. “A lot of what [King] stood for is not remembered today — certainly not by the tech companies.” Instead of contributing to affordable housing, they “don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they park the money overseas”. ', 'According to opponents like Perry, technology, rather than offering solutions to these problems, is making things worse. It has already contributed to the fragmentation of society, but the coming wave of automation will also wipe out. many types of work. This, he argues, is partly why tech companies already treat their low-paid workers and contractors as expendable.', 'What money there is can seem like a drop in the bucket. Kevin Zwick, head of the non-profit Housing Trust Silicon Valley, has raised $20m so far from local companies via a bond issue to back low-income housing development. But he struggles to hide his frustration. “These companies have a lot of capital that they could invest in affordable housing if they wanted to,” he says.', 'He takes a stab at estimating how much spare cash the biggest tech companies are sitting on — and, guessing $50bn, undershoots by a factor of 10 — before adding: “If you just sliced off a per cent of that — that type of money would easily create tens of thousands of units through the Greater Bay Area.”', 'Apple, the richest company in the world, with $262bn of cash and investments, arouses the strongest reactions from the industry’s critics. Larry Stone, who as county assessor is responsible for coming up with the valuations on which property taxes are based, bristles at what he claims are the company’s hardball tactics on agreeing assessments.', 'But he is even more incensed by its lack of support for its local community — the kind of thing he says traditional companies used to care about. “I can’t stand cheapskates,” he says. “The largest company in the world could and should do more. They’re just not a community-oriented company. They should be giving to transportation, to education, they should be supporting non-profits for housing, social services.”', 'Apple says that it is “the largest contributor to the local economy”, and is “supporting schools and public works projects across the Santa Clara Valley”. It adds: “Cupertino has been Apple’s home for more than 40 years and we are proud to have a strong relationship with the community here.”', 'The fact that Facebook and Google have made housing part of their development plans shows they recognise that some action is needed — not least to protect their own businesses by not pricing future workers out of the market. This year, Google has taken the first step towards building homes directly for its own workers, with plans to put up 300 temporary apartments at Moffett Field. But even so it is impossible to deal with the full impact of the company’s surging growth. Says Siegel: “Google has done just about everything they could to solve these problems — except not grow.”', 'According to Bennett in East Palo Alto, Facebook representatives invoked Zuckerberg’s old motto — “Move Fast and Break Things” — when sitting down with local community leaders to discuss how to deal with the problems of gentrification.', '“I hate that,” she says. “While we need to move moderately fast, we don’t have the luxury of breaking things. Families are living this life and in danger of losing their homes.”', 'The difficult social and economic issues caused by the tech giants’ colossal success seem unlikely to bend to the kind of technocratic solutions their leaders often adopt. According to Stone, it will require something else — the kind of commitment to supporting local communities that, he says, Boeing showed in Seattle when he was growing up.', 'To him, the tech corporations seem more like insular empires than companies with deep ties to their local neighbourhoods. “The problem with this place is, most people come from somewhere else,” he says. “People in this area don’t have identity. That impacts the way people think about their community.”', 'From Stone’s office in San Jose, the low-rise tech sprawl spreads towards the horizon. “You can’t identify its boundary with any accuracy,” he says. “Silicon Valley is more a concept or an idea than a place.”', 'Richard Waters is West Coast editor of the Financial Times', 'More from the Financial Times: Trump’s China IP push puts big tech in a bindGermany puts Africa’s health on G20 agenda  Why a dumb phone is a smart move']",100

But online  buyers tend to be more targeted in their purchases, seeking  the best deal on a particular item, and are less  likely to spontaneously add extra items to their cart.', '  What’s more, because online shoppers have typically invested less  time and energy into their search than is required by  visiting a store, they’re more likely to shift their  attention away from a particular retailer, Mader said.', ' Read MoreRetail snapshot: Who’s winning on and  offline', '  “Online you’re always one click away from failure,” he said.', '  According to Pitney Bowes, nearly half of U.S. shoppers have  returned an online purchase through the mail.

He said he recently spoke with a small e-commerce company in Germany that  lowered its return rates from 50 percent to about 25 percent, just  by better describing its items.', '  “Twenty-five percent less returns makes a major difference,” he said.', '  The digital shift has made it easier for shoppers to  price compare. While that’s great news for consumers, it’s not so  great for retailers, particularly those who carry the same items as their competitors. ', '  This results in companies slashing their prices, in what pricing firm 360pi has called a race to the bottom. But this online transparency isn’t only tied  to price tags, Mader said.

Target at that time lowered its guidance for the fiscal year, citing a “difficult” retail  environment.', 'While sales across the industry remain challenging, particularly in categories like apparel, a flurry of holiday forecasts are calling for growth between 3 and 4 percent. The National Retail Federation predicts revenue will grow at a faster clip in November and December, rising 3.6 percent.', 'Like the NRF, Target CEO Brian Cornell pointed to a healthier economic backdrop — which includes low fuel prices and more robust employment — as two signs that shoppers will be ready to spend this holiday.', '  “I think we’re entering the holiday season with a consumer who is  feeling good about the state of play,” Cornell said.

This exclusive assortment includes  more than 100 unique “Star Wars” items, and throwback games  including The Oregon Trail card game.', '  Target is carrying the idea of one-off partnerships through to  its other major departments, including apparel, home, and food  and beverage. It’s more than doubling its roster of craft beers,  wines and spirits, from 700 to 1,500.', '  “We’ve got to deliver a unique, differentiated experience,”  Cornell said. ', 'Target’s blanket free shipping offer helped the retailer notch a  34 percent increase in its digital sales last holiday. Starting  Tuesday, the company will once again eliminate its minimum  spending requirement to qualify for free shipping. And because  Hanukkah runs though Jan. 1, Target will extend this promotion an  additional week this season, to end on New Year’s Day. This  should help relieve stress on both customers and its systems,  Cornell said.', '  The company has meanwhile rolled out the ability to ship from its  stores to an additional 600 locations, to shorten its delivery  window. And with 35 percent of its online orders getting picked  up in-store, Target has built more clear, attractive signs to  signal these areas to shoppers. ', '  “Last year we saw a huge surge leading up to Christmas,” Cornell  said. “We expect the same type of surge this year.”', 'Electronics weighed heavily on Target’s revenue during the fiscal  second quarter, with comparable sales in the category sliding  double digits. That included a 20 percent dip in Apple products.', '  Target is trying to breathe life back into the category this  holiday by highlighting virtual reality products  including PlayStation VR  and VR One Plus, as well as new connected-home products  such as Google Home.  It’s also invested heavily into Apple products, including the new  Apple Watch.', 'Since Cornell came on board at Target, he’s focused on bringing  back some of the “wow” factor the brand lost when it focused too  much on price. But he has admitted this year that the  company’s messaging has now skewed too far away from value.', '  While style will still take a front seat in much of its messaging  this holiday, 60 percent of its marketing will be focused on  value. That’s an increase of about 20 percent from last holiday.  As part of this initiative, Target will offer $10 off a $50  purchase in a different category each week, including home and  apparel.', '  It will also repeat a promotion that offers a deal on a different  item for 10 days, and highlight more low-price items at the end  of its aisles.', 'When Target rebranded the low-cost merchandise featured at the front  of its stores into Bullseye’s Playground, comparable sales in the  area grew more than 25 percent over the prior year. ', '  Target is once again tapping into that strategy with an upgraded  presentation for its seasonal items, which it’s dubbed  “Wondershop.” These shop-in-shops will sell 2,000 new holiday  products starting Nov. 1.', '  Fresh off its best year in more than a decade, Target is playing  up its home decor and entertainment categories, in an  attempt to make its stores a one-stop shop for party  planning. ', '  It’s also added 1,000 new products to its Cat & Jack kids’  apparel line, which launched in July and has been posting  double-digit growth “week after week,” the company said.']",100

The Pacific Maritime  Assocation, which represents employers, claimed longshoremen  began holding back crews after Halloween in order to pressure  employers, while the International Longshore and Warehouse Union,  representing dockworkers, claimed the opposite, saying that  employers are asking for only half the normal work  crews.
