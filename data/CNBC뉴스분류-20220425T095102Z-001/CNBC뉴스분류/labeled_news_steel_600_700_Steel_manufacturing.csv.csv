At last year’s annual meeting, over 24% of votes were withheld from each of the incumbent directors, indicating strong shareholder discontent. However, the company has cumulative voting, which would guarantee the group two seats if they chose to give up on majority and put all of their votes towards two candidates.

Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.', 'Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it.', 'So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.', 'And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.', 'Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.', 'Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.', 'Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans’ 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.', 'And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.', 'Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.', 'To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit.', 'A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 — slashing their tax bill in half.', 'This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system — and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.', 'We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year — forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone.', 'We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.', 'Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.', 'Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing — a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.', 'One of Staub’s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters’ education. Please join me in congratulating Corey.', 'Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.', 'This is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.', 'So to every citizen watching at home tonight — no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.', 'Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.', 'We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.', 'Together, we are rediscovering the American way.', 'In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is “in God we trust.”', 'And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.', 'Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans’ graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston: a job well done.', 'Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston’s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.', 'Americans love their country. And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.', 'For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.', 'Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.', 'We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.', 'And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve — and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.', 'I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.', 'All Americans deserve accountability and respect — and that is what we are giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers — and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.', 'In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.', 'We have ended the war on American Energy — and we have ended the war on clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world.', 'In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America’s autoworkers — so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.', 'Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States — something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing — for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming back.', 'Exciting progress is happening every day.', 'To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.', 'We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.', 'People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure — I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the “right to try.”', 'One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.', 'America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation’s wealth.', 'The era of economic surrender is over.', 'From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.', 'We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.', 'And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.', 'As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.', 'America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year — is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?', 'I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.', 'Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.', 'Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment — to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.', 'Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process — getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.', 'Together, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.', 'We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.', 'We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.', 'As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.', 'As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.', 'Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.', 'For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.', 'Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters — Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens — were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors — and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school.', 'Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320 million hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.', 'Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again.', 'The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.', 'So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties — Democrats and Republicans — to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans — to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.', 'Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez — he goes by CJ. CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.', 'CJ: Great work. Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.', 'Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.', 'In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise — one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.', 'Here are the four pillars of our plan:', 'The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age — that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.', 'The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country — and it finally ends the dangerous practice of “catch and release.”', 'The third pillar ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system — one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.', 'The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.', 'In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.', 'It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.', 'These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.', 'For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.', 'Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.', 'These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.', 'In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.', 'My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult — but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.', 'As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.', 'We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.', 'In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: “You will do it — because you can.” He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.', 'Ryan and Rebecca: You embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you, and congratulations.', 'As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.', 'Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.', 'For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.', 'As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet.', 'Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.', 'Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.', 'Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.', 'Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin’s selfless love for a fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a “V” for “Valor.” Staff Sergeant Peck: All of America salutes you.', 'Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.', 'In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.', 'So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay.', 'I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa’ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists — wherever we chase them down.', 'Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.', 'Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.', 'Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this recognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.', 'That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America’s friends.', 'As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.', 'When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.', 'I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.', 'My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.', 'But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.', 'North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.', 'We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.', 'Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.', 'We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.', 'Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June — horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.', 'Otto’s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight — along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve.', 'Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.', 'In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves — permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had — and he resolved to be free.', 'Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.', 'Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most — the truth.', 'Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.', 'Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.', 'It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that, together, they could light up the world.', 'That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.', 'Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.', 'Monuments to Washington and Jefferson — to Lincoln and King.', 'Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga — to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond. And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.', 'And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol. This living monument to the American people.', 'A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us — defending hope, pride, and the American way.', 'They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.', 'But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.', 'Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.', 'Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again.', 'As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.', 'As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.', 'Our families will thrive.', 'Our people will prosper.', 'And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.', 'Thank you, and God bless America.']",29

A proponent of a tough  U.S. position on China, Lighthizer has negotiated restrictions on  steel imports and was deputy U.S. trade representative in the  Reagan administration. ', '  Ideologically, that puts Lighthizer on the same page as Peter  Navarro, author of “Death by China” and Trump’s appointee to  head the newly created National Trade Council. Trump’s pick for  Commerce secretary, billionaire Wilbur Ross, will also be  involved with the trade council. ', '  “I could certainly see this group promoting tariffs that are not  WTO-consistent and saying, ‘Who gives a damn,’” said Charles  Freeman III, managing director at consulting firm Bower Group Asia and former  assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs. ', '  “Lighthizer comes from the days before WTO … and a lot of  trade people who come from before that era regularly talk about  WTO as unilateral disarmament,” Freeman said.', '  The Trump transition team and Lighthizer did not respond to CNBC  requests for comment.', '  The WTO was formed in 1995 and consists of a set of trade  agreements negotiated and signed by its members. Those policies  support free trade of goods and services across borders and oppose governments attempting to protect national  industries with subsidies and taxes on imports. ', 'But critics say  countries like China have been unfairly allowed to reap benefits  without cutting back on its own protectionist policies, to the harm of  other members like the United States. ', 'China was admitted to the WTO in 2001, and millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs fled the country for China in the months and years that followed.', '  Lighthizer is one of those free trade critics. In the closing  paragraph of a 2011 opinion piece in The Washington  Times, he wrote: ', '  “I think you’re setting up both a philosophical and a practical  way in which the U.S. government [is going] to renegotiate trade  agreements both with and without WTO,” said Gregory Husisian,  chair of law firm Foley & Lardner’s export controls and national security practice. ', '  “It’s going to be a continuation of the steel trade wars and  expansion of that to cover more products,” he said. ', '  Under the Reagan administration in the 1980s, Lighthizer  threatened quotas and punitive tariffs on Japan to help reduce  imports into the United States. At the time, the U.S. government also enacted  “voluntary export restraint” programs which limited auto imports  from Japan and global steel imports in the 1980s. ', '  Lighthizer then spent nearly three decades as a lawyer  representing U.S. steelmakers and other companies in anti-dumping  and anti-subsidy cases. ', '  “Lighthizer is the only one who has any trade law experience, and  his trade law experience is pretty darn deep. Not everyone in the  trade community is a fan,” Freeman said, also saying that  Lighthizer is “a very respected, and frankly feared, trade lawyer  in this town.”', '  With Trump yet to take office, it’s still unclear how far the new administration will push past existing trade frameworks such as the WTO. ', '  Lighthizer “seems to be talking about doing things that are  within the existing rules,” said Edward Alden, Bernard L.  Schwartz senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and  author of “Failure to Adjust: How Americans Got Left Behind in  the Global Economy.”', '  “He’s talking about a range of more aggressive action.

24,2018-07-30T11:00:26+0000,"['Harley-Davidson CEO Matt Levatich on Monday rolled out an aggressive “more roads to Harley” growth plan that includes an expanded lineup of lighter motorcycles, smaller urban retail stores, a new digital strategy and an international push as U.S. sales fall.', 'The Wisconsin-based company said it is launching by 2020 a new platform of 500 cc to 1250 cc middleweight bikes and an even smaller bike for emerging markets in Asia. The biggest Harley engines run at around 1,700 cubic centimeters and weigh more than 1,000 pounds — making the new lineup a significant departure from its signature HOGs.', '“We’re going to be doubling down on existing products. We’re going to invest in an all-new middleweight platform, which is a modular chassis and a very core engine technology to go in three dramatically different spaces: adventure touring, custom and street fighter,” Levatich said in a wide-ranging interview with CNBC’s Morgan Brennan. He also touched on politics and trade and Harley’s investments in overseas facilities that have drawn criticism from President Donald Trump.', 'Harley’s shares have fallen nearly 13 percent this year and profits have dropped as the 115-year-old company struggles to find a foothold among millennial buyers, who are turned off by the high prices for the heavy bikes. The 0.7 percent gain in international sales during the second quarter wasn’t enough to offset a 6.4 percent decline in the U.S. ', 'The company is expanding its push overseas, particularly in India and China, and it’s launching its first electric motorcycle, LiveWire, next year with additional models through 2022. Harley is increasingly investing in production facilities overseas to avoid tariffs. In India, tariffs double the cost of a bike.', 'Trump has criticized the company’s international investments. He said in a July 3 tweet that the administration was working with other motorcycle companies after Harley announced plans in June to move its European market production out of the U.S. because of retaliatory tariffs from the European Union. That was after he stirred up customer anger in a tweet a few days before.', '“Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I’ve done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won’t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors,” the president tweeted.', 'Levatich called Trump’s statements “unfortunate attention” to some tough decisions the company’s had to make in recent years. He said Harley works hard to stay out of politics. “We just deal with what we have to deal with; we are not a political organization. We’ve worked very hard to be apolitical in how we approach our business and our consumers, everywhere in the world,” he said.', 'While its bikes were once taxed at 6 percent in Europe, the new tariffs raised that to 31 percent. Harley-Davidson was already under pressure because of the Trump administration’s tariff that levied a 25 percent tax on steel and aluminum imports. India levies a 100 percent tariff against Harley’s motorcycles that are made in the United States. Harley-Davidson has facilities in Brazil, India and Thailand to tap those high-growth, emerging markets.', 'The company’s added costs from the global trade conflict could reach $100 million annually by 2019, according to CFO John Olin.', '“While Harley’s preference is to manufacture all of its bikes from the U.S.,” the company has had to invest in plants overseas over the last 20 years to offset costly tariffs that make its bikes unaffordable in other countries, Levatich said. “We’re only doing that because these are important growth markets for the company that without those investments we wouldn’t have access to those customers, at any kind of reasonable price.”', 'Bob Lutz, the former vice chairman of General Motors, empathized with Levatich.

The founder of Berkshire Hathaway is planning a special “golden  anniversary” publication, marking 50 years since he took a  controlling stake in the company.', '  Mr Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, are  independently writing their views of Berkshire’s extraordinary  journey during the past five decades—and what they expect  for the next five. Neither is changing a word of the other’s  commentary. Readers will be able to compare the two sets of  reflections and predictions, in addition to the regular annual  letter.', '  By writing about the next 50 years, the two men, who have a  combined age of 175, will be attempting to shape the future of  Berkshire — and their legacy — amid an intensifying  debate about what this unusual company will look like when they  are gone.', '  They took an ailing New England textile business and turned it  into one of the most successful investment vehicles in history,  through a combination of acquisitions in insurance and other  industries and a portfolio of equity investments in American  icons such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and American Express. Over the past generation, as  shareholders at other companies have demanded a focus on a core  business, Berkshire has only diversified more.', '  Now, with the addition of US power companies, one of North  America’s largest railways and a 50 per cent stake in Heinz, it  is probably the world’s most diverse conglomerate; it is  certainly the largest. With a market value of $358bn, it is  bigger than General Electric.', '  As Mr Buffett, 84, the company’s chairman, chief executive and  chief investment officer, has aged, the debate about whether the  ragbag entity should be split apart after his retirement has only  got louder. But the debate may be shifting. While he and Mr  Munger, the 91-year-old vice-chairman, insist that they have  built an enduring company with a culture all its own, investors,  analysts and long-time Berkshire watchers are focusing on more  nuanced questions of management structure.', ' More from the FT.com:', '  “The most important thing to Warren Buffett is, how can he  position Berkshire for the future so that it continues to  generate increased value for shareholders,” says Jay Gelb, an  analyst who covers the company for Barclays and who is invited  each year to pose questions to Mr Buffett at Berkshire’s annual  meeting. “I think this could be his most important annual letter  yet.”', '  Mr Buffett’s missives, which come out around the end of February  and run to 30 pages or so, are packed with nuggets of investment  wisdom, expansive pedagogical passages and jokes. The world’s  most successful fund managers, private equity bosses and  corporate chief executives cite them as influences and read them  just as voraciously as any small shareholder or business student.', '  Yet perhaps the letters’ biggest role is to be the glue that  holds Berkshire together, the philosophical foundation of a  confounding company.', ' Read MoreBuffett tops mostgenerous  philanthropist ranking', '  The forthcoming Buffett and Munger road maps for the next 50  years could act as companion to the “Owner’s Manual” Mr Buffett  wrote for Berkshire shareholders in 1996, in which he set out 15  guiding principles. These included a promise to seek solid  businesses and to hold them forever, instead of chasing quarterly  earnings and churning the portfolio. It also enshrined  Berkshire’s management culture, which leaves subsidiary company  bosses to run their own show, without interference from the head  office in Omaha, which is still staffed by just 25 people.', '  The annual letters include pointed exhortations against paying  dividends or taking on too much debt, all of which will be hard  for Mr Buffett’s successors to ignore, and which they can use in  answer to outsiders urging change.', '  “No one who steps into his shoes will have Mr Buffett’s authority  or credibility,” says Larry Cunningham, the law professor and  author, who has published an annotated anthology of the letters.  “To the extent that he can provide texts, rules, principles, it  will all be very helpful. It will fortify the successor.”', '  Such fortification may be necessary in an age where hedge fund  activists are gaining traction with their demands that companies  spin off divisions, halt investment, add debt to the balance  sheet and return cash to share-holders — actions which are  anathema to Mr Buffett. Close followers of the company say talk  of breaking up Berkshire will remain just that: talk. In fact,  several are betting it will be able to keep bulking up, both  under the present management and over the long run under Mr  Buffett’s successors.', ' Read MoreBuffett’s bad bets = a big year', '  Under its present structure, Berkshire can invest the cash from  its operating businesses and the premiums raised by its insurance  companies, giving it a financing advantage over others who must  arrange more expensive borrowing to do deals. Mr Gelb estimates  Berkshire currently has $25bn in excess cash to spend on  acquisitions. Its 2013 deal to buy Heinz in partnership with  Brazilian private equity group 3G Capital — which brought in  management expertise — will be a template for even bigger  purchases, he says.', '  “He is trying to put all the pieces on the board so that the next  CEO does not need make any overly challenging decisions,” Mr Gelb  said. “The Buffett estate will still own a substantial proportion  of the company, so it is not as if an activist can immediately  come in and demand changes. That allows the next CEO some room to  manoeuvre without having to worry about what the investor base or  analysts like me say.”', '  Bob Steel, the former Goldman Sachs banker who is now chief  executive of boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, says the  rise of hedge fund activism may be a boon for Berkshire, rather  than the threat it is sometimes thought of. It may find  acquisition targets more receptive to selling out.', '  “Mr Buffett has built a brand that is seen as a Good Housekeeping  seal. He is quite comfortable to let management run businesses  and to be supportive, so the brand makes him an attractive person  for companies to work with,” says Mr Steel.', '  “Activism will make the world a different place for lots of  companies. If more companies feel uncomfortable making  investments, such as spending on research and development, maybe  some of those companies will dial 1-800-WARREN and find that to  be an interesting alternative.”', ' Read MoreBuffett tops most generous  philanthropist ranking', '  If the future of Berkshire is not to be broken up but is in fact  to get even bigger and more diverse, then the question switches  to whether its current, minimal head office will be able to cope.', '  Mr Buffett has said the company will split his job between at  least three people when he is gone. There will be a chairman,  which Mr Buffett hopes will be his son Howard, a chief executive  officer and one or more chief investment officers. Academics who  have studied Berkshire and other companies think something more  radical may be needed.', '  “A key question is how to impose management change on an  underperforming division, when management change becomes  necessary,” says Bruce Greenwald, professor of finance at the  Heilbrunn Center for Graham and Dodd Investing at Columbia  Business School. “People trust Warren Buffett to be an expert in  every industry, but they are not going to trust any other single  person in that role. His successor would not have the bandwidth  or the credibility.”', '  In his recent book Berkshire Beyond Buffett, which was based on  interviews with many of the chief executives of Berkshire’s  subsidiary companies, Mr Cunningham floated the idea that the  company would need to group the subsidiaries and appoint up to 10  divisional presidents to act as a new layer of management.', '  This is what happened at Marmon, a mini-conglomerate of  manufacturing and services businesses assembled by Jay and Bob  Pritzker, which Berkshire acquired in 2007, says Mr Cunningham.', '  “Both companies were built through acquisitions over decades by  iconic figures who knew every bit of history and all of the  strengths and weaknesses, and when they left there was no person  on the planet who could have that knowledge,” he says. “Mr  Buffett’s successor might think ‘I cannot have 80 people  reporting to me, but I can divide that by 10’. It seems an  inevitable step that someone will have to take.”', '  Berkshire has already begun grouping results from its  subsidiaries under five headings: insurance; railroad; utilities  and energy; manufacturing; service and retailing, and finance and  financial products.', '  Meanwhile, Berkshire shares entered the golden anniversary year  close to record highs. They jumped by more than 25 per cent in  2014, in part because the company is more heavily oriented to the  improving US economy than others of its size, which tend to be  multinationals.', '  With Mr Buffett apparently in fine health, the transition to new  management may not be an immediate issue but it tops analysts’  lists of risk factors — and even the world’s largest  investors are fascinated by how events will play out.', '  “I ask myself all the time, when he is not there will Berkshire  stock go up or go down,” says David Rubenstein, founder of  Carlyle Group, the private equity firm. “And I don’t know. It  could go up on the theory that if you broke it up there is more  value to it, but it could go down because people think there is  nobody who could possibly do what he has done.”', '  Howard Marks, founder of Oaktree Capital Management, whose own  regular investment letters have a wide following, is also  watching closely. “They will divvy up the job and, by definition,  the person or people managing the money won’t be the greatest  investor in history, so it will regress toward the mean,” he  predicts. “But hopefully not all the way.”', '  As Messrs Buffett and Munger put the finishing touches to this  year’s letters, they are doing so with eyes as firmly on the  future as on the past, with the aim of guiding their successors  in managing and investing for the long term.', '  After Mr Buffett is gone, the letters will remain. And if the  message of the letters endures, so too may Berkshire Hathaway.']",-1

Once considered the great American success story —  — the shale oil boom that powered the state cooled considerably when the price of oil began falling the following year. Production is rebounding now as prices rise, but not before an exodus of college-educated workers hit the state.

The state also does poorly on costs, technology and innovation, education and access to capital.', 'One might think that the rising oil prices that powered Texas to the top of our rankings this year would also help Alaska. After all, North Slope crude oil tends to command a higher price than the Texas variety, and Alaska officials say production is up in response to the higher prices. But everything is relative. Alaska oil is also more expensive to produce, and the Department of Revenue is forecasting output to level off.', 'And then there is that budget deficit.

It comes in the midst of a Commerce Department investigation into whether all vehicles coming into the United States pose a national security threat, which could be used justify a tariff.', '“For consumers, there would be no benefit,” said Ivan Drury, senior manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, an online auto research guide.', '“If you artificially inflate the price of some cars to be uncompetitive, you give the lower-priced cars a buffer to raise their prices,” Drury said. “At the end of the day, it would just mean higher prices for everyone.”', 'Automakers and business groups have sounded the alarm that tariffs would wreak havoc on the industry.', '“Tariffs will lead to increased producer costs, increased produced costs will lead to increased vehicle costs, increased vehicle costs will lead to fewer sales and less tax receipts, fewer sales will lead to fewer jobs, and those fewer jobs will significantly impact many communities and families across the country,” the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said in a statement Wednesday.', 'Trump’s latest auto tariff threat came on the heels of the European Union imposing its own 25 percent duty on $3.2 billion worth of imported American goods. The EU’s action was in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum that went into effect June 1.', 'As it stands, it’s uncertain whether any of the threatened auto tariffs could become reality or are simply negotiating tactics by the president. However, the auto-related national security probe was initiated using the same part of the law that Trump used for the new tariffs on steel and aluminum.', 'If new duties on foreign-made autos were to be imposed, car buyers would see prices rise fairly quickly.', '“There isn’t more than about 60 days of inventory at dealerships, so it wouldn’t take more than a month or two to affect consumers,” said Jeff Schuster, president of Americas Operation and Global Vehicle Forecasting for researcher LMC Automotive.', 'The breadth of an auto tariff would initially dictate what segments of car sales are affected. For instance, if Trump followed through on his threat specifically against the EU, it would largely affect luxury brands that ship from Europe, such as Mercedes-Benz and Audi, Drury said.', 'Exactly how much prices would rise would depend on whether automakers pass on the full increase to U.S. buyers.', 'For illustration purposes: If a full 20 percent tariff against EU imports were passed on to consumers, the starting price of a 2018 Mercedes SL Roadster would jump by $17,640 to $105,840 from its current $88,200.', 'Meanwhile, if the tariff were imposed on all imports regardless of country of origin — which could come about from the Commerce Department evaluation — a broader swath of the market would be affected.', 'More from Personal Finance:Social Security benefits buy 34 percent less than in 2000, study shows', 'LMC Automative’s Schuster estimates about 8 million imported cars would be hit in that scenario. About 17.5 million cars were sold in the United States last year.', 'The average price of a new car is about $34,600, according to Edmunds data. Again for illustration purposes: If an import cost that amount, a 20 percent increase would translate into an extra $6,920, for a total of $41,520.', '“If you add that kind of increase, you’d be looking at consumers replacing a substantial number of those vehicle purchases with used cars, or they’ll delay their purchase,” Schuster said.', 'Some foreign automakers manufacture various brands in the United States. Those cars would not be subject to tariffs.', 'At the same time, interest rates are rising, which already is making the cost of borrowing more expensive. The average rate paid on a five-year loan for a new car is 4.78 percent, according to Bankrate.', 'Consumers also have been stretching their loan terms to accommodate higher prices, with the average length of a car loan at 69.5 months, recent data from Edmunds show.

Sixty  percent of families with more than $1 million in investable  assets already work with a financial advisor. Eighty percent of  our clients never have had an advisor.

The manufacturing layer is the mutual funds and ETFs.  Then there are the custodians, such as Fidelity Investments and  TD Ameritrade, both of whom we work with. The third layer is the  advisor—for example, LPL Financial or Raymond James and, at  the highest end, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street private bank  groups. We are additive to that topmost layer.

Among them, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Italian far-right Northern League, who has openly embraced the U.S. president’s push for more tariffs. ', 'Salvini, 44, took over the party in 2013 from its founder, Umberto Bossi. He has been an omnipresent media figure who has used the country’s growing economic discontent, and wariness about immigrants, as a vehicle to reach voters. The PM candidate is in favor of Italy’s exit from the euro which he has called a “Germany currency” that has damaged Italy’s economy. With Italian elections on March 4, Salvini made a pledge: “If Italians will choose me as prime minister I will [impose tariffs] like Trump. I will defend Italian workers and entrepreneurs even if it means putting up tariffs to protect the ‘made in Italy’ brand.”', 'Salvini’s party has been gaining ground ahead of Sunday’s elections in Italy. Austerity policies and unpopular reforms have empowered the populist parties in Italy as they have in Greece and elsewhere in Europe. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement, the far-right Northern League and Brothers of Italy, another far-right eurosceptic party, have accumulated great power over the pro-European forces expressed by the ruling Democrats and Silvio’s Berlusconi Forza Italia party. Italy’s weak economic growth which lags the rest of the euro area has given these populists ammunition. Currently, Italy has 1.5 percent GDP growth versus 2.4 percent for the rest of the eurozone. The eurosceptic Italians are accusing globalization for the economic weakening of Italy and this narrative has become popular with many in the electorate. They point to the fact that 20 percent of Italy’s manufacturing industry, which was the largest in Europe after Germany’s prior to the adoption of the euro in 2002, has been destroyed, and about 40,000 companies have disappeared.', 'Adopting political positions against globalization, similar to President Trump, they preach that the economic backwardness of Italy has its roots in the immensely degraded political culture of the country’s elite, which, in the last few decades, has negotiated and signed countless international agreements and treaties without ever considering the real economic interest of the country and without any meaningful planning of the nation’s future.  The far-right eurosceptic parties argue that previous governments never recognized that indiscriminate opening to Asia’s light industrial products would destroy Italy’s once leading industries in the same sectors. They also accuse previous governments for signing the euro treaties without taking into account the implications that handing monetary policy over to the ECB would have on Italy’s national sovereignty.', '“Nearly a decade after the global financial crisis, real disposable incomes per capita in Italy are still below pre-euro accession levels and have fallen behind other euro area countries.This reflects the persistent under-performance of Italy’s economy, particularly productivity,” Emilios Avgouleas, a professor of banking law and finance at the University of Edinburgh, told CNBC. The eurosceptic parties rhetoric resembles President Trump’s on many other issues, including immigration and protecting the country’s borders. They blame the previous governments for signing the Dublin Regulation — a European Union law that determines the EU Member State responsible to examine an application for asylum seekers seeking international protection under the Geneva Convention — knowing perfectly well that Italy is not even remotely able to patrol and protect its borders.', 'In this context, one possible result in the Sunday elections could be an outright victory for a center-right coalition that not only includes Berlusconi’s party but also the Northern League and Brothers of Italy, with the strongest of the three choosing the next prime minister. In an effort to control the far-right forces, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said on Thursday he would stand as candidate for prime minister for Berlusconi’s Forza Italia in the March 4 vote.  The most desirable outcome for markets and Europe would be a grand coalition, or a national unity government, of centrist political forces including both the Democratic party and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party. Although the anti-establishment Five Star Movement could emerge as the biggest party under the present circumstances, it could prove difficult to find enough allies to form a government.', 'The rise of nationalism in Italy is not surprising. For years Italians have suffered through economic crisis and stagnation. Unemployment remains at a high of 10.8 percent and wage growth is below 1 percent. Its high public debt, 132 percent of GDP, is the second-highest in the 19-country eurozone after Greece.', 'No doubt the outcome of the election will determine how political tensions with the EU will unfold.  A drama similar to the one that happened in Greece after left-wing Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras won the prime minister seat could happen.', 'Economists hope that politics will not stall the Italian economy’s road to recovery. Last year, the country’s gross domestic product grew at a rate of 1.5 percent, its fastest pace since 2010, and is expected to maintain that momentum this year, according to the IMF. Italian shares have been among the best performers in Europe. The country’s 10-year bond yield, a key measure of its borrowing costs and investor confidence in its fiscal sustainability, has remained low, hovering around 2 percent. ', 'But ahead of the election some unease has crept into markets, leading to underperformance in the bond market. Economists worry how the populist agenda could affect Italy’s economic growth prospects in the future. ', 'Analysts’ have warned that a possible predominance of eurosceptics could lead Italy’s 10-year yield premium over German bunds from 140 basis points today to 260 basis points, a level not seen since 2013. This would be harmful for Italy. According to the IMF, for every 100 basis points increase in Italian spreads, the higher borrowing costs are passed on to the real economy, depressing growth by 0.4 percentage points.', 'More from Global Investing Hot Spots:The truth about diversifying abroadIf Trump thinks he’s taking steel tariff trade war to China he’s wrong', 'Why Warren Buffett loves loathed Israeli drug stock Teva']",-1

They will be key players in whatever strategy Hackett implements over the next several quarters. Being longtime industry veterans, they may likely provide a counterweight to Hackett, who built his career largely outside the auto industry.', 'Hinrichs has operations experience, having risen through the ranks in various manufacturing, logistics, and material planning functions. Farley, on the other hand, comes from a sales, marketing and customer-care background, with experience in higher-end auto brands.', 'Both have deep international experience.', 'And though Hackett has the CEO job now, either Farley or Hinrichs could end up with that post in a few years, said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson, in a note sent Monday.', '“First, we’d suspect that new CEO Jim Hackett will likely be a medium-term CEO,” wrote Johnson, “with a successor to be groomed over the coming years (perhaps in 3-4 yrs).”', 'With Farley and Hinrichs “now respectively managing the business units and some of the key business functions, it appears both are vying to take over as CEO after Hackett’s work is complete,” Johnson said. “Both have big challenges and perhaps the board’s thinking is this will motivate them to cut deeper, act faster, etc.”', 'Under Hackett, Johnson expects potentially more cost cutting, possibly even more than was seen under Mark Field’s tenure as CEO.', '“If there was one area where Ford was admittedly soft in more recent years,” Johnson said, it was around exceeding expectations of profitability.”', 'It might be one of the factors putting downward pressure on Ford stock. Ford stock has been down roughly 16 percent over the last year, whereas shares of GM, Toyota, Volkswagen and Honda are all up.

', '“For example, profits on the new F-Series, while solid, appear to be less than they could be due to decisions on commodities, such as steel and aluminum,” Johnson said. “A new role of head of global operations would allow these issues to be addressed.”', 'Since 2012, Hinrichs has been executive vice president and president for the Americas, running Ford’s North American and South American business units.', 'Prior to that, Hinrichs was group vice president and president of Asia Pacific and Africa beginning in December 2009, and served as chairman and CEO of Ford China from November 2010 to December 2011.

Jaffa oranges symbolized the country’s exports until the 1970s. Textiles played a large role and it is known internationally for its diamond trade and its strong position as an arms exporter.', 'Now the high-tech boom that Israel has been experiencing for some two decades has the potential to make it a player in many industries where traditionally it has not figured very prominently, says Avi Hasson in an interview with CNBC. He was, until April, chairman of the Israel Innovation Authority, as the Office of the Chief Scientist was rather pointedly renamed last year.', '“Traditional definitions of high-tech and low-tech are out of date. Everything is getting technologized. There’s not a single sector that’s not being disrupted, or that doesn’t benefit from innovation,” says Hasson. He tells how, during his six-year term, he fielded daily visits from executives of multinational companies from all kinds of industries, seeking new technology.', 'Israel’s edge in innovation is illustrated by the country’s number two ranking on the subject in the World Economic Forum’s 2016-2017 Competitiveness report. Israel’s overall competitiveness ranking was 24th, ahead of some major economies, like China and South Korea but well behind most of Western Europe, the US and several Asian economies.', 'The relative health of Israel’s high-tech industry is itself hotly debated among analysts and observers. The Innovation Authority’s 2016 report, looking at Israel’s relative drop in three leading indices in 2015, even sounded a warning: “It is difficult to ignore the overall picture indicating erosion in Israel’s competitive situation.”', 'The mood has considerably brightened since then, with the industry raking in record investments in 2016 and then in March this year seeing the biggest deal in its history with Intel’s acquisition of autonomous driving technology company Mobileye.', 'Whatever the fluctuations in its relative global standing, high-tech remains leading in the Israeli economy. It makes up about half of the country’s industrial exports. But, warns Hasson, it may not be enough.', '“It’s a tremendous achievement, world leading, high productivity etcetera. But it only employs about nine percent of the workforce and the other parts of the economy are not performing as well, for example in their productivity, in their connectivity to the global value chains,” notes Hasson.', 'He says that macro-economic data shows that there is a big productivity gap between some traditional industry sectors in Israel and their peers in the OECD. Also, the ability of Israel’s more traditional industries to access international markets is limited.', 'The Innovation Authority actively tries to address that problem. He says: “We’ve created several programs that are oriented toward the traditional industries, like food and steel and textile and plastic, really trying to ignite innovation in those sectors. The same goes for the services sector, things like financial and also construction.”', 'Traditional industries have many different reasons for not always being able to innovate as quickly as they would like to. They have, for one, much less access to capital, both domestically and internationally than the high-tech sector.', '“When you come and say let’s do a high-risk R&D project that in three years’ time, if successful, will take you to the international market, there’s a leap of faith that needs to happen,” says Hasson. The Innovation Authority has introduced measures to mitigate that risk.', 'Israel, “is never going to be a manufacturing powerhouse,” like the U.S. and Germany, says Hasson. But that doesn’t mean it cannot have its success in other industrial fields, helped by high-tech.', '“Textile used to be a huge industry in Israel, I’m talking thirty years ago, and then it all but disappeared,” says Hasson.', '“Today there are 15,000 people working in textile industries in Israel. But if you look into the companies, these are not low-tech companies. It’s smart fibers, nonwovens, all sorts of pretty high-tech textiles. The same thing goes for food, and the same would go for plastics by the way, which has done remarkably well in terms of its global performance.”', 'The innovation potential is not limited to fields Israel is already involved in. High-tech brings new industries to the country, says Hasson. This can happen when large international companies acquire Israeli high-tech ones.', 'He mentions Mobileye and other autonomous driving technology firms as an example of how Israel can gain access to entire new industries: “Ten years ago Israel wasn’t a player in automotive, now I would claim it’s a leading player. Why? Mostly because the car has become digital, connected and autonomous and that part we know how to do even if we’re not automotive experts. The same goes for digital health and a lot of sectors where the players are looking for innovation. Today Israel stands out as at least a place to visit when you’re considering expanding.”', 'The same can be true within the high-tech industry. Acquisitions can actually help create new export opportunities, he says: “There are acquisitions that are now exporting billions of dollars outside Israel and employing a lot of people and I don’t know if that would have been the case if the companies had remained independent.”', 'Amid all these developments, Asia will play an increasingly important role for Israel, says Hasson. The Innovation Authority has made it a target, not only in terms of market but also as a place for collaboration in innovation. Asian interest in Israel over the last two to five years has been “staggering”, he says.', 'There’s a high degree of complementarity between Israel and countries such as China and Japan, even though these are very different, says Hasson: “Israel always supplies that cutting edge, out of the box innovation and there you have the scale-up, the manufacturing and, naturally, the understanding of the local market.”', 'He counts making headway in the region as one of his achievements in office. “You can really see that happening for Israel in a big way, in China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and so on,” he says with evident enthusiasm.', 'Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

But doing so with anything short of a deal-signing — which Trump said in October was the next step — would mark the fifth instance this year that he delayed or canceled tariffs as a gesture of goodwill, further exposing him to criticism that the “phase one” deal exists only as a talking point.', 'Enacting the tariffs would cause its own problems. Republicans and Democrats alike would worry the White House was gambling with a U.S. economy already seeing some cracks in its strength. American farmers, many in swing states, would see exports further shrink and endure deeper financial suffering, not to mention continued retaliation.', 'And Chinese negotiators, already frustrated with Washington doublespeak and insisting that tariffs be removed would likely walk from negotiations, says Stephen Myrow, managing partner at Beacon Policy Advisors.', '“Most people around President Trump are telling him that’s a big risk,” the former Treasury official told CNBC. “Throwing everything on right now would be a pretty big political miscalculation.”', 'Dan DiMicco, a former steel executive who shares Trump’s propensity for tariffs and often shares trade advice with him, said the president will win in either outcome.', '“Going into this date, President Trump has a lot of latitude depending on where the talks are really at, which no one outside of him and his team know,” DiMicco said. “He really is in a no-lose situation.”', 'Since the October truce, information about the state of talks has been nearly impossible to glean. U.S. readouts of principal-level calls stopped in early November, leaving interested parties to rely on information funneled to Chinese state media.', 'U.S. officials have used phrases like “short strokes” and “millimeters away” to emphasize that a deal is in the home stretch — without indicating what, exactly, is left to negotiate of the deal that was announced as complete on Oct. 11. ', 'Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic advisor, said Friday that there are a “few buttons that have to be buttoned” to wrap up talks, but acknowledged that there could be a watershed mid-month.', '“The fact remains that Dec. 15 is a very important date with respect to a ‘go,’ or a ‘no-go,’” Kudlow said on Squawk on the Street.', 'And Trump has given mixed signals about his inclination to do a deal: Within the space of one day this week, he suggested a deal could be more than a year away, then after a 400-point market sell-off, he suggested the talks were going well.', 'Dan Clifton of Strategas Research Partners says Trump stands to benefit politically if a deal is reached in the near-term that solves a limited number of low-hanging issues, like rolling back tariffs and restoring export markets. American incomes would rise – and the manufacturing- and ag-heavy states would see their fortunes reverse.', '“Not coincidentally, these are the states Trump needs to win the most in the electoral college,” Clifton tells CNBC.', 'Business groups have leaned on their executive members to provide dispatches from the ground. Anna Ashton, director of business advisory at the US-China Business Council, says positive signs have been emerging.', '“We hear from both sides that the negotiators are close to a deal, so there is reason for optimism that we will not see new tariffs this month,” Ashton said. “But as you know, they’ve been close to a deal before, only to have intractable differences resurface.”', 'Officials have acknowledged the pain this particular round of tariffs could exact on the U.S. economy. Originally set to go into effect Sept. 1, White House officials urged Trump to delay them to limit the economic impact going into the Christmas season. They are now set for Dec. 15.', 'The list includes items that were excluded from prior tariffs primarily because of a potential impact on consumers and voters. In May, Mnuchin told lawmakers that the U.S. economy had been largely insulated from the tariffs because of this structure but acknowledged that would change if the goods in the December list were hit by tariffs.', '“The way these tariffs were designed was, the last tranche is really the consumer issue,” Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee. “The last tranche is subject to the president’s approval.”']",-1
