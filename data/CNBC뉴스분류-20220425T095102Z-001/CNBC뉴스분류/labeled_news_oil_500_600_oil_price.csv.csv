But in the back half of the year, commodity watchers anticipate new headwinds for the oil market.', 'The upshot is Wall Street expects a moderate recovery for oil in 2019. Investment banks see Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, averaging about $68-$73 a barrel next year. Forecasts for U.S. crude mostly fall in a range between $59-$66 a barrel.', 'Last week, Brent briefly dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time since July 2017, while U.S. crude bounced off a 1½-year low at $42.36. Both benchmarks have lost more than 40 percent of their value amid darkening forecasts for growth in oil demand and surging output from top producers the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia.', 'While the outlook looks brighter in 2019, end-of-year research notes are filled with warnings that oil prices could spike or slump outside of that range. The risks range from closely watched macroeconomic factors like the U.S.-China trade dispute to underappreciated threats emanating from refineries in Asia.', 'The key drivers behind the anticipated rally in the opening months of 2019 are OPEC policy and North American oil production.', 'OPEC, Russia and several other producers in January will launch new production cuts that aim to remove 1.2 million barrels per day from the market. The producers began capping output in January 2017, but lifted the curbs in June ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC’s third-biggest producer.', 'The alliance will get a hand in course correcting from Alberta, Canada.

While China has been sopping up lots of crude, it has also been churning out huge volumes of refined products like gasoline. The firm warns that a glut of Chinese fuel could create contagion throughout the global oil market.', 'According to RBC, “continuing down the path of the current elevated refinery run rate would intensify gasoline balances that are already downward spiraling and potentially kick off a domino effect in which a gasoline glut created in the East ultimately reverberates westward and results in an oil market led lower by an oversupply of refined product.”']",100

Goldman believes Iranian exports will drop by about 1 million bpd to 1.4 million bpd. In that scenario Brent could settle back into a range between $70 and $80 a barrel before year end.', 'Currie believes more Saudi and Russian barrels are on the way, and production from the long-dormant Saudi-Kuwaiti neutral zone could start up within months.

Those waivers, along with the refusal of some nations to fully comply with the sanctions, will slow the loss of Iranian barrels.', 'In Barclays’ view, OPEC members have enough spare capacity to cover the drop in exports. Cohen also believes the market is putting too much stock in media reports that Saudi Arabia is “comfortable” with oil prices above $80 a barrel.', '“The recent increase in prices has gone too far, in our view. Although prices may continue to rise from current levels in October, the market is ripe for a correction,” he said in a research note Tuesday.', 'RBC Capital Markets stresses that Iran’s response to the sanctions will determine whether the rally can continue.', 'Helima Croft, RBC’s global head of commodity strategy, expects Iran to become more antagonistic — restarting some nuclear activity and increasing support for regional militant groups — but expects the regime to avoid outright military conflict. However, if Iran seeks to disrupt oil shipments through busy Middle East waterways, ramps up cyberattacks and withdraws from a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, Croft says the market could add a $10 to $15 a barrel premium to oil prices.']",100

At the end of the day, the loss of market share for Iran is a gain for the rest of the region. Other than letting others pocket money for the barrels you no longer can sell, you could target those barrels and maybe in the process push the price up and put some pressure on the Trump administration which doesn’t want to see higher gasoline prices.

Likewise, OPEC members Libya and Nigeria were exempt from the original deal in 2016 due to ongoing internal conflicts that curtailed their oil supplies.

Moscow can balance its budget with Brent crude around current levels, and cutting output requires negotiations with a web of partly state-owned energy firms and private companies.', '“I think its possible that Russia just won’t be involved in any kind of tangible way,” said Derek Brower, a director specializing in political risk at RS Energy Group. “If anything, Russia will give verbal endorsement to cuts but then in practice not really do much in terms of restricting supply.”', 'Brower also believes there’s a high likelihood OPEC’s official statement will leave the market parsing its policy. The key, he says, is the baseline that OPEC sets for production cuts.', 'If the group sets the baseline at this month’s levels, when Saudi output likely hit a record 11 million bpd, the cuts would have less impact than if they were compared to a month when OPEC pumped less oil.', 'For the moment, those details appear to be undecided, and analysts say Saudi and OPEC leaders have been unusually quiet in the lead-up to the meeting.', '“I think everything is still in play,” Brower said. “There is no agreement on the baselines as things stand.

In April West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, plunged below zero and into negative territory for the first time on record. Meanwhile May is shaping up to be WTI’s best month ever, going back to the contract’s inception in 1983—an astonishing turnaround month-on-month.', 'Improvements on both the demand and supply side of the equation have pushed prices higher. Data shows that people in the U.S. and China are starting to hit the road again, while producers around the globe have cut output at record rates in an effort to prop up prices.', 'The contract has jumped more than 70% in May and posted four straight weeks of gains, but some traders warn that the near-term outlook for oil remains uncertain, and that prices could head back into the $20s after settling around $33 on Friday.', 'Additionally, part of WTI’s blistering rally this month is due to the historic low from which it bounced. Prices are still about 50% below January’s high of $65.65, significantly cutting into profits for energy companies, which are often saddled with debt. A number of U.S. energy companies have already filed for bankruptcy protection, including Whiting Petroleum, which was once a large player in the Bakken region. If prices stay at depressed levels, there could be more casualties.', 'Still, the market has shown signs of rebalancing itself, and analysts say that if demand continues to improve and producers keep wells shut-in, the worst could be over for oil.', '“The oil market rebalancing continues to gather speed, driven by both supply and demand improvements ... These improvements are taking out the risk of a sharp pull-back in prices although we re-iterate our view that the rebalancing will take time,” Goldman Sachs said in a recent note to clients.', '“We believe that the next stage of the oil market rebalancing will be one of range-bound spot prices with the most notable shifts being a decline in implied volatility as well as a continued flattening of the forward curve without long-dated prices rising yet,” the firm added.', 'While demand for petroleum products fell off a cliff in April, the outlook is improving as  economies around the world begin to reopen. Raymond James, which has been tracking shelter-in-place orders, said that of the 3.9 billion people worldwide who have been under lockdown at some point since January, 3.7 billion, or 95%, have experienced some sort of reopening.', 'Chinese demand for oil in April rebounded to 89% of what it was a year earlier, according to IHS Markit, and the firm expects May demand to be 92% of 2019′s level. During February’s low, demand in China, the world’s largest oil importer, fell to just 40% compared to a year earlier.', 'In the U.S., all 50 states have begun the reopening process to varying degrees, which means people are once again driving. Data from the Energy Information Administration has shown an uptick in gasoline demand, although there’s still a way to go before the pre-coronavirus levels are reached.', '“All eyes are on demand ... this is mainly a demand problem,” said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence at Enverus. She sees WTI hovering around the $20s to mid-$30s mark in the near-term, as demand continues to come back. “We’re expecting Q3 will look better from a supply/demand balance standpoint. You need a market that’s in equilibrium to start seeing higher prices, and so Q3 is really the first quarter where we’ll see that happen, because a lot of the demand is supposed to come back,” she added.', 'Evercore ISI echoed this point, writing in a recent note to clients that supply will continue to outpace demand in the second quarter, but that by the third quarter the “tide will turn,” at which point demand will exceed supply.', 'On the other side of the equation, historically low oil prices forced producers to shut in production at a record rate. Beginning May 1, OPEC and its oil-producing allies took 9.7 million barrels per day of production offline, after agreeing to the deepest production cut in history during an extraordinary, multi-day  meeting in April.', 'Then, earlier in May, Saudi Arabia said that, beginning June 1, it would voluntarily cut an additional 1 million bpd, on top of its portion of the cuts agreed to by OPEC+. Kuwait and UAE were among the other cartel members that followed suit and said they would also exercise additional cuts.', 'Norway, Canada and the U.S. are among the other nations that also announced well shut-ins as oil prices plummeted.', 'The latest figures from EIA show that U.S. production has dropped 1.6 million bpd below the March high of 13.1 million bpd. Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are among the companies that have scaled back operations.', 'Darwei Kung, head of commodities at DWS Group, said that the rebound in oil prices is riding on lasting production cuts. But if prices rise enough that producers, including those in the U.S., ramp up output again, there’s a chance that OPEC+ could abandon its cuts in an effort to gain market share.', '“We view the most important consideration for the supply part of the equation is the ability for OPEC+R countries to stay with policy to maintain price stability,” Kung said. “In doing so, they have to commit to the production cuts even if a third party, such as [the] U.S., increase production as the oil price recovers.”', 'As the oil market begins to re-balance itself, traders say another big risk is a possible second wave of coronavirus cases and subsequent return to shelter-in-place restrictions. Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities at Bank of America, said this would have “devastating consequences.”', 'The firm said that the rebound in prices has come faster than expected, and forecasts WTI averaging $32 per barrel this year and $42 in 2021. Bank of America expects international benchmark Brent crude to average $37 this year. The contract settled at $35.13 per barrel on Friday and is also coming off a fourth straight week of gains.', '“It is not clear if the rest of the world [outside China] can successfully prevent major reoccurrence of COVID-19 spread, given the disparity between countries or states within a country on containing the disease. A second wave of infection can change the recovery for oil demand significantly,” added Kung. He noted that souring relations between the U.S. and China could be another headwind for oil going forward.', 'The WTI contract that plunged into negative territory in April was for crude that was set to be delivered in May. With storage rapidly filling, including in the U.S. hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, no one wanted to take delivery of oil as demand was expected to remain depressed throughout May and into June.', 'Enverus’ Johnson said this was the “painful period” needed to force companies to shut-in production, and that prices dipping into negative territory was the market functioning correctly. “We’re definitely not out of the woods,” she said, before adding that the set-up looks much better in the back half of the year.', 'Barclays has a similar forecast, writing in a recent note to clients that oil prices will “remain volatile as participants try to find a path through the extreme distortions caused by a fall off the cliff in demand and a lagged supply response.” For 2020 the firm sees WTI averaging $33 per barrel, before rebounding to $50 per barrel in 2021.', '- CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed reporting.']",-1
30,2018-05-14T17:55:32+0000,"['In a significant shift in thinking, several economists contacted by CNBC now believe a rise in oil prices may not produce very much, if any, drag on U.S. growth.', 'Some even contend that the nation’s new oil-producing prowess make a rise in prices “a wash” for growth.This is a complete about-face for old metrics where it was practically automatic for economists to mark down growth when oil prices rose.But the rise of the United States to become the world’s second-largest oil producer has changed the calculus for how rising energy prices affect the economy. Consumer pain at the pump is now seen as an offset to an extent by increases in capital spending by U.S. oil companies and by gains in the growing number of regions producing energy. And what once would have been a massive surge in the oil trade deficit, which would subtract from gross domestic product, is now offset to a large degree by U.S. oil exports.“We think the effect will round to a wash,″ said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist with J.P. Morgan Chase. “Our prior modeling would likely have produced a slightly more adverse impact, perhaps annualizing to a quarter point off growth for two consecutive quarters.“Now, Feroli sees a roughly 0.2 percent decrease from lower consumer spending offset by a 0.2 percent gain in capital spending.To be sure, economists contacted by CNBC said they could not be sure if the positives would offset the negative at any oil price. A return to prices over $100 a barrel could overwhelm the consumer and exert a strong negative drag on the overall economy.', 'In addition, oil has an outsized effect on American consumers’ psyche, beyond the actual costs. A sustained period of $3 a gallon for gasoline could weigh on confidence and spending. Finally, there could well be a mismatch in the timing of an offset to lower consumer spending from capital spending so that one quarter shows a drag while the next one exhibits a boost.John Ryding of RDQ Economics is not quite ready to say it’s a wash, but he offered: “You’re not looking at the kind of magnitude that we used to think about oil prices hurting the U.S. I think that it’s less than a third of the impact that it used to be.“Ryding said the biggest issue will be one of distribution. Higher oil prices amount to a wealth transfer from consumers to shareholders, and from oil-consuming regions to oil-producing regions. But this time, a lot more of the money will stay within American borders with the question of how petrodollars get divided inside the country.', 'The rethink of the oil price impact is borne of the recent decline in prices in 2014 and 2015 and its failure to boost the economy. J.P. Morgan in a research note did what few economists do these days: They went back and looked at their errors.It found the oil price impact on consumer spending ended up being 0.7 percent less than what it would have expected, and the drag from capital spending was 0.2 percent more. Put simply, lower oil prices added less to consumption and took away more from investment than the old forecasting metrics would have implied.Some Federal Reserve officials have learned the lesson. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told CNBC on Monday that the negative consumer effects and the positive investment effects “more or less washes out.”“This will also encourage U.S. production, and compared to years past, oil prices have a more neutral effect on the U.S. economy,″ Bullard said. “It used to be a big oil shock was probably bad news, … but now I think it’s neutral.“A key to the offset is whether and by how much companies step up to invest. Many investors and lenders were burned in the last price runup so the sector could have some difficulty attracting long-term capital. And, productivity continues to improve in the oil sector, meaning fewer rigs are needed to extract the same amount of oil as even five years ago. Finally, some of that capital equipment will be imported, a drag on the U.S. trade deficit that will offset at least some of the surge in oil exports.But that’s at the margin of a stark change in the U.S. energy profile. U.S. oil production has surged from a low of 4.6 million barrels a day in 2005 to a new record high of 10 million bpd. It’s risen 13 percent in just the past year, following the price of oil higher.Importantly for balance of payments, the result of more U.S. production is a sharp decline in imports, which have fallen by 42 percent in real dollars since 2005, while exports are up 318 percent. That is, they have gone from a basically a negligible amount to a meaningful offset to imports.']",-1
