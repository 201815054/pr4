In all twelve of these filings, Starboard has had a positive return on its investment and their average return on the twelve is 71.62%, versus an average of 23.23% for the S&P 500 during the same time periods.', 'Starboard believes that the company trades at a deep discount to peers and should take one or more of the following actions (i) improving gross margin by rationalizing its manufacturing footprint, (ii) reducing cyclicality and boosting FCF conversion by exploring a fab-lite model and (iii) continuing industry consolidation.', 'ON Semiconductor is a premier semiconductor company that focuses on power and sensor products. The company sells products across diversified, attractive end markets with the automotive and industrial markets making up almost 60% of revenue. These markets have a long runway for growth with long product life cycles. Approximately 80% of the company’s revenue has 3-plus years in product longevity and about 50% is 7-plus years, making this a very stable business. Also, because the company primarily focuses on analog and power components and sensors, it is positioned to win business regardless of end product features.', 'Since 2007, the company has spent approximately $6 billion buying companies to strengthen its product portfolio and improve its competitive positioning.  Over the long term, the company has had slow and steady revenue growth, but has seen recent declines. In 2019, revenue declined due to broad weakness in the semiconductor industry, driven by an inventory correction and the trade war with China. In 2020, the company suffered because of the Covid-19 crisis. Specifically, the company suffered because of its fab-heavy model which includes a heavy fixed cost base. Despite strong end market exposure and product positioning, results have lagged both management’s plan and peer medians – the company has a 9.2% operating income margin, much lower than management’s target plan of 22% and even more significantly lower than its peers - 33.7%. As a result, the company is trading at the widest disparity to peers in years, with a pro forma EBITDA multiple of 7.3x versus 16.5x for its peers.', 'Keith Jackson has been CEO of the company for 18 years and has done a tremendous job of building the company through organic growth and acquisitions. However, now is a time not for growth but for integration and rationalizing operations to run more efficiently. This was not management’s forte and the company is now at an inflection point where they can bring in the right CEO for this point in its life cycle – Jackson has already announced that he will be retiring as of May 2021.', 'Starboard sees multiple ways to win at the company. The first opportunity is to rationalize the manufacturing footprint and improve utilization rates to improve gross margins. The company suffers from excess costs since it has not fully integrated its acquisitions or realized other synergies from its acquisitions. The company has 12 manufacturing facilities all over the world, and could easily operate with only 3 – 7 facilities. The company has already begun to take steps in the right direction, moving from smaller and outdated facilities to better equipped facilities with excess capacity, and Starboard believes there are even more opportunities here.', 'Next, Starboard believes there is an opportunity to shift to a fab-lite model which would allow for more stable gross margins, more flexibility to meet surges in demand and deal with downturns, higher free cash flow conversion and better returns on capital. Moreover, external foundries are often better at manufacturing and more efficient, so this could result in even better pricing and quality for the company’s clients. Maxim Integrated is an example of a company that moved to a fab-lite model and now does 75% of its business externally. As a result, Maxim has been able to increase gross margins by almost 500 basis points, reduce capex from 10.5% of revenue to 2.5%, and is now able to have much more stable margins during downturns. It is the fab-heavy model that the company presently employs that is likely the biggest contributor to its inferior EBITDA multiple valuation relative to its peers.', 'The final opportunity here is strategic. Starboard sees an opportunity for continued industry consolidation and believes that the company is uniquely positioned as a scaled asset trading at a discount. While the company has historically been an acquirer, it could make an attractive target for a number of strategic buyers. There has been significant industry consolidation and in the last five years, transactions have occurred at a median multiple of 17.2x, higher than where the company trades today at 10.6x. Moreover, in between CEOs is an ideal time to explore a sale and with an activist involved, it almost automatically puts the company in play.', 'With the company at an inflection point, it can benefit from adding Starboard directors to the board on many levels. First, with all of its success in the semiconductor industry and one of the largest networks in the industry, there is nobody better to help identify, evaluate and negotiate the CEO succession. Secondly, Starboard has an extensive history of improving margins from a board level, particularly in technology companies.

That’s really … the reason for our ‘intention to float’ message,” he added.', 'In March, Volvo Cars — which is headquartered in Sweden but owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group — said it planned to become a “fully electric car company” by the year 2030.', '“There is no long-term future for cars with an internal combustion engine,” Henrik Green, Volvo Cars’ chief technology officer, said at the time. “We are firmly committed to becoming an electric-only car maker and the transition should happen by 2030.”', 'Volvo Cars is one of a number of automakers looking to make the transition to fully electric vehicles. In July, Germany’s Daimler said its Mercedes-Benz brand would “be ready to go all electric at the end of the decade, where market conditions allow.”', 'In February, Ford said its entire passenger vehicle range in Europe would be “zero-emissions capable, all-electric or plug-in hybrid” by the middle of 2026, with a “completely all-electric” offering by 2030.', 'This transition comes as major economies also lay out plans to move away from the internal combustion engine.', 'The U.K., for example, wants to develop a net-zero transport sector by 2050, stopping the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero tailpipe emissions.', 'Elsewhere, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, is targeting a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from cars and vans by 2035.', 'All the above changes are taking place while global car manufacturers continue to battle the impact of a global semiconductor shortage.', 'On Tuesday, figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed that 215,312 cars were registered in the U.K. during September 2021. This represents a decline of 34.4% compared to the same month in 2020, with the SMMT describing it as the “weakest September since 1998.”', 'In a statement, the industry body said the “ongoing shortage of semiconductors” had impacted vehicle availability.

Still, if China successfully develops its own semiconductor industry, that could ultimately hurt American companies that have reaped big profits in the country.', 'Last month, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on a U.S. blacklist that required American firms to obtain government permission to sell to the company. The telecommunications equipment maker relies on some key components from U.S. firms and software from Google and Microsoft. Washington has granted a 90-day reprieve for now, but the threat remains a major problem for the company. ', 'Other firms, including Chinese surveillance titan HikVision, are reportedly also being targeted. Huawei rival ZTE faced a similar situation last year, which significantly damaged the company.', 'While China has made no secret that it wants to develop its own semiconductor industry in the past couple of years, experts said that recent events have given new priority to that drive.', '“The Huawei incident has indeed stimulated the development of China’s domestic chip industry,” Gu Wenjun, analyst at China-based semiconductor research firm ICWise, told CNBC by email. He wrote in Mandarin and his comments were translated by CNBC.', 'Beijing highlighted semiconductors as a key area of the Made in China 2025 plan, a government initiative that aims to boost the production of higher-value products. China aims to produce 40% of the semiconductors it uses by 2020 and 70% by 2025. That’s backed by tens of billions of dollars of investment from Beijing into the country’s chip industry.', 'Last month, the Chinese government also announced tax breaks for homegrown semiconductor companies and software developers.', 'Currently, only 16% of the semiconductors used in China are produced in the country, and only half of those are made by Chinese firms, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In other words, the country is still reliant on foreign, largely American, technology.', 'That fact, along with Beijing’s backing, has helped kick China’s tech companies into action. Huawei has its own “Kirin” series of processors for its smartphones and even a 5G modem that can allows devices to connect to the newest version of the mobile internet. Huawei’s chips are designed by its subsidiary HiSilicon, which has said it’s prepared for such a move by the U.S. and can weather the storm.', 'China’s other technology giants are considering their own silicon. Smartphone maker Xiaomi told CNBC last year that it was exploring developing a chip that could power artificial intelligence products and Alibaba has begun work on its own AI processor.', 'Design is one part of the puzzle in creating chips. The other is getting the manufacturing right. For example, Huawei’s chips are designed by HiSilicon — the largest semiconductor company in China, according to market research firm International Data Corporation — but then they’re manufactured by a separate company in Taiwan. There are signs, however, that China is even ramping up manufacturing of semiconductors.', '“I expect the current tension between the U.S. and China will only invigorate the spending in China on technology including software over the next five years,” said Mario Morales, program vice president for enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC.', 'The development of China’s own chip industry could hurt U.S. companies, according to ICWise’s Gu. He said the world’s second-largest economy could build closer ties to other countries like Japan and South Korea and create its own semiconductor “ecosystem” — in which America would play only a small part.', '“At present, the global industrial system is dominated by the United States, and there may be a parallel ecosystem ... where the United States is not dominant. This is very unfavorable for the long-term development of the U.S. industry,” Gu told CNBC.', '“If the United States blocks the Chinese industry for a long time, it will inspire China to lead another ecosystem, which in turn will be a long-term disadvantage to the U.S. semiconductor industry,” he added.', 'Already some U.S. firms have reported worries about the potential results of Huawei being on the U.S. blacklist. Qorvo, a maker of radio frequency products, said sales to Huawei and its affiliates accounted for $469 million, or 15% of its total revenue, in the fiscal year that ended on March 30, 2019. It lowered its revenue outlook for the year, citing Washington’s actions against Huawei.', 'Lumentum, another Huawei supplier, said sales to the Chinese firm accounted for 18% of total revenue for the three months that ended on March 30. Lumentum also revised its revenue guidance lower for the subsequent quarter.', 'Despite all its advances, China’s semiconductor industry won’t overtake its competitors anytime soon.', 'One of the biggest challenges for China will be finding and developing new suppliers if American firms remain off limits.', 'For one, Huawei’s HiSilicon still relies on basic chip design from Softbank-owned Arm. Even though HiSilicon produces processors for its devices, the architecture is from the British firm. The chip designer recently suspended business with Huawei to comply with the U.S. blacklist of the Chinese firm. Huawei will need to find an alternative to Arm, which is the biggest chip design firm by market share.', 'The next biggest companies are Synopsys and Cadence, but both are American and so are likely to be off limits for the Huawei unit, too.', 'For Gu, that all adds up to China only closing the gap with the U.S. on semiconductors “within a decade or two.”', 'Other analysts projected that more investment and an expanded talent pool may grow China’s semiconductor industry.', '“This will not be easy, it will be a long journey but I do not underestimate the Chinese ecosystem given the talent that continues to move back into the region to drive more innovation and scale,” IDC’s Morales said.', 'And, eventually, China might be able to wean itself off of U.S. technology.', '“If China as a whole is able to acquire the right human resources talent, companies, and partnerships, it should still be on track to create a homegrown semiconductor industry over the next decade without access to American tech,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.', '—CNBC’s Hilary Pan contributed to this report.']",102

Going into 2021, the company is Needham analyst James Ricchiuti’s top pick. To support his even more bullish stance, the five-star analyst bumped up the price target to $91 (20% upside potential) from $75, in addition to reiterating a Buy rating.', 'Ricchiuti acknowledges that CLH shares “have a low bar to clear,” as it was one of the few names in his coverage universe to drop in 2020 and was outpaced by several of its competitors. According to the analyst, two COVID-related factors played a part in this lackluster performance.', '“The shock from COVID dampened an expected recovery in CLH’s Safety-Kleen (SK) used-oil recycling business while the core Environmental Services (ES) business also was dinged as the effects of COVID rippled through the broader economy,” Ricchiuti explained.', 'However, the tides could be turning for the company in 2021. “With improving macro data, including higher manufacturing output, we expect CLH’s core incineration and landfill services to see stronger demand in 2021. Even if the recent COVID spike causes the recovery to pause, CLH has something of a natural hedge in the ES business, as it will likely drive more high-margin COVID emergency response business,” the Needham analyst noted. Additionally, he expects to see a gradual recovery in the SK segment next year.', 'On top of this, the increased focus on ESG could benefit CLH, “both in its oil-recycling business and given its leadership position in safely handling hazardous waste and capabilities in responding to a variety of environmental emergencies,” in Ricchiuti’s opinion.', 'Therefore, given that the stock is trading at less than 10x Ricchiuti’s 2021 adjusted EBITDA estimate, the risk/reward profile is “attractive.”', 'Landing a top 100 ranking, Ricchiuti is currently tracking a 68% success rate and 21.6% average return per rating.', 'The travel industry as a whole was leveled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but Cowen analyst Helane Becker sees Southwest Airlines as a top pick for 2021.

However, the path forward over the next six months will be challenging. We believe Southwest shares remain an attractive option for participating in airline recovery upside without taking on outsized downside risk, compared to peers,” Becker opined.', 'Although some investors have expressed concern about when LUV will see traffic, capacity, revenue and profits rebound to 2019 levels, Becker notes that these questions don’t necessarily apply to this airline company. 2019 saw headwinds related to the MAX grounding hamper the company. As the aircraft returns to service, the analyst believes the cost outlook will improve and growth will accelerate.', 'Becker added, “Southwest’s cost structure has the most to gain from a normalized schedule as they’ve staved off furloughs and are carrying excess pilots due to the MAX grounding.

And if that’s what the members want to do, then that’s what we will do.”', 'Meanwhile, several senators are working on versions of a stock-trading ban, including a new effort from Warren, D-Mass., and Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines. Many of the bills proposed so far, including one backed by Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Mark Kelly of Arizona, would require incoming members of Congress to place their stock portfolios in a traditional blind trust.', '“When you’re elected, you’re here to serve the people, not the elite, and [a stock trading ban], I think, is a step forward, an important step forward, to restore the faith and trust of the American people in this institution,” Daines told CNBC on Wednesday.', 'McCarthy, the House minority leader, and other top Republican lawmakers have in recent weeks discussed with donors ways they could campaign on the issue of limiting lawmakers’ equity ownership.', 'If there’s any subject that unifies the most conservative Republican and the most liberal Democrat, it’s a deep skepticism of China and a motivation to ensure U.S. economic competitiveness.', 'Americans’ views on China are as frigid as they’ve ever been, according to survey results released by Gallup last year. Its polling found that some 79% of Americans view Beijing as “very” or “mostly” unfavorable.', 'That may be part of the reason the Biden administration has retained many of the hardline economic and national security measures first imposed under Trump. Biden, though, has traded his predecessor’s openly bellicose language and tit-for-tat tariff exchanges for a more subtle strategy — one that seeks to check Beijing through global alliances and by reducing U.S. reliance on Chinese commerce.', 'One big bipartisan effort that could reach Biden’s desk in 2022 is the pending legislation to modernize U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and otherwise bolster competitiveness with the communist superpower.', 'The Senate first passed a $250 billion version of the measure — the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act — in June on a bipartisan basis. That bill was the product of almost every Senate committee with input from a range of Republicans and Democrats, and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., took the lead in guiding it through that chamber.', 'Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., cheered the legislation’s goals when the bill cleared and said he’d have liked an even-more-pointed piece of legislation.', '“As a China hawk and a fiscal hawk, I would have liked for this bill to take a more focused and aggressive approach to the China threat – but this is a strong start,” he said in a statement. “The Chinese Communist Party is working overtime on cyber, AI, and machine learning so that they can become the world’s preeminent superpower.”', 'The House took months to review and pass its own version of the bill, but finally did so on Friday in a $350 billion bill titled the America Competes Act.', 'That measure, however, cleared the House almost entirely along party lines after the chamber’s Democrats sought to use proposed changes to trade policy to add protections for U.S. workers. The House bill included language to help remedy racial disparities and inequalities; the Senate draft did not include this language.', 'Still, the versions share similar core ambitions like enhancing domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign sources by reinforcing the U.S. supply chain, Morgan Stanley policy strategist Michael Zezas wrote in early February.', 'Small differences in the two bills have forced lawmakers from each chamber to form a conference committee to reconcile the versions. For example, Senate Republicans may insist the final legislation add bolder language to confront Beijing and strip out proposed contributions to the United Nation’s Green Climate Fund.', 'But Zezas remains optimistic that lawmakers will ultimately come to a compromise.', '“Conditions have long been conducive for enactment of a bill of this kind given the entrenched, bipartisan skepticism of the US-China relationship among voters and policymakers,” he wrote.', 'Another potential area for bipartisan policy partnership is on cryptocurrency regulation.', 'Democrats and Republicans are both eager to develop a framework in which the nation’s many crypto investors, issuers, miners and exchanges can market digital assets. The market is like the “Wild West,” according to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has has repeatedly asked lawmakers for legislation.', 'Better guidelines, codified rules and regulations could at the very least work to protect investors from the price volatility that has thus far dogged many digital assets. Even bitcoin, one of the world’s most popular digital assets, isn’t immune: Its value has declined by more than 33% over the last three months.', 'All signs point to a major piece of legislation from Lummis, a Republican freshman senator from Wyoming and a crypto-industry supporter, in the coming weeks. While the details of the draft are not yet available, her legislation is expected to include input from a range of government agencies and tackle many currently unanswered questions faced by the industry.', 'The industry and regulators have asked Congress to offer guidance on which assets belong to varied asset classes, protections for retail investors and clarity on the jurisdiction of the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve.', 'It’s likely that progressives like Warren will want to make their own changes to the Lummis bill given well-documented disagreements about how much regulation the industry needs and how much risk it poses to investors. Still, such a massive piece of legislation is likely to be debuted with the support of at least one moderate Democrat.', 'Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, stressed the bipartisan desire for more legislation over digital assets on Tuesday during a hearing to assess the Biden administration’s recent report on stablecoins.', '“We need legislation. We agree on that,” he said in prepared remarks. “Currently, there is no federal law to address digital assets. With nearly a quarter of American adults now invested in crypto, we must move quickly to put in place a framework that clearly defines the rules of the road.”', 'One of the most divisive issues facing Congress is whether — or how — to change the nation’s voting laws.', 'Senate Democrats failed in January to pass a voting rights bill to combat a wave of new ballot restrictions in states across the country. The majority had hoped to establish national standards for ballot access as a way to undermine new voting rules Republican state legislatures have imposed in the wake of the 2020 election and Trump’s defeat.', 'But one area of bipartisanship remains.', 'A bid to revise the Electoral Count Act of 1887 in the aftermath of the historic election two years ago has lawmakers on both sides of the aisle looking to tighten the rules around future contests.', 'Trump and his allies tried to use the vague language in the law to overturn the results of the election and deny Biden’s victory. Specifically, the former president claims that then-Vice President Mike Pence could have acted unilaterally Jan. 6, 2021, as the presiding officer of the joint session of Congress to reject states’ electoral votes. Pence refused to do that, and a mob of Trump supporters invaded the Capitol, delaying Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory.', 'Pence, who last week disavowed Trump’s claim, said there is “no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.”', 'In an effort to head off similar battles in the future, a bipartisan group of at least 15 senators have begun work on shoring up the language in the law.', 'Their proposal would clarify that the vice president has no power to reject a state’s electors, give states additional time to complete legitimate recounts and raise the threshold for Congress to consider objections.', 'Currently, a valid objection only requires one lawmaker from each chamber.', '“On Jan. 6 [2021], I was shocked to learn that it only took ONE Senator and ONE House member to object to a state’s results,” wrote Tom Block, a policy strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors.', '“Plus, there is the confusion sowed by former President Trump on the role of the VP in counting electoral votes,” Block added. “There appears to be broad bipartisan support for taking action to update the 1887 Act.”', 'Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia have galvanized members of both parties to consider whether Congress should spend more on the American military as part of the next attempt to fund a government budget.', 'Democrats and Republicans are locked in talks about overall spending levels for the current fiscal year and are expected to pass a short-term stopgap bill to thwart a partial government shutdown later this month.', 'The White House has thus far called for a 15.9% increase in nondefense spending for fiscal 2022, but only a 1.7% bump to the armed forces budget.', 'The GOP has ridiculed that disparity in recent weeks as geopolitical tensions worsen between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine. The Pentagon is urging Congress to reach a deal that would allow it greater flexibility and ability to respond to changing threats across the globe.', '“The biggest issue where a bipartisan agreement will need to be reached is funding a government budget for the remainder of fiscal year 2022,” Block wrote. “There is widespread agreement that with changing geopolitical forces the U.S. needs to adjust its military spending and that will require decisions beyond the static spending that is inherent in a continuing resolution.”', '“The two sides are talking about an omnibus spending bill with new funding split between defense and nondefense,” he added. “I think this may be the biggest bipartisan legislative accomplishment/need this year.”', '— CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed to this article.']",28

These metrics factor in the number of ratings published by each analyst.', 'Here are five stocks that were recently upgraded by Wall Street’s best-performing analysts:', 'Based on operating margin catalysts as well as its valuation, ON Semiconductor just scored an upgrade from Baird analyst Tristan Gerra. Now rating the stock a Buy, the top analyst also increased the price target from $38 to $48 (29% upside potential).', 'While management guided for revenue that is less than the seasonal norm, Gerra remains unfazed.', 'Expounding on this, the analyst stated, “The company’s aggressive inventory shift… along with a very significant rebound in utilization rates enabled them to gain share in 2Q by outshipping competitors, in our view. We do not view management’s preliminary 3Q below-seasonal revenue outlook as the sign of a coming downcycle, but rather a capacity limitation with the potential for the company to exceed second-half expectations on better supply availability.”', 'On top of this, the semiconductor company has been working to improve its mix. These efforts will be bolstered thanks to the current “tight supply environment,” in Gerra’s opinion, rather than if ON was operating in an over-supply environment.', 'All of this prompted the analyst to note, “Investors for the medium-term should be rewarded with significant upside both from an ongoing upcycle and likely the most significant turnaround in the company’s history. Cost initiatives, mix and pricing should catalyze further gross margin expansion in both 2H and 2022 as product repositioning initiatives gain momentum.”', 'Gerra is currently tracking a 62% success rate and 20.4% average return per rating, according to recent data provided by TipRanks.', 'In a research report entitled “The Retail ‘Shift’ Appears Here to Stay,” Roth Capital analyst Darren Aftahi makes the case for e-commerce name Shopify. In addition to upgrading the stock to Buy, he also set a $1,530 price target, suggesting 37% upside potential.', 'Looking at the company’s 1Q results, the numbers “once again” beat Aftahi’s raised and above consensus expectations “as growth accelerated across all key segments and metrics.” Total revenue growth reached 110%, and total gross merchandise value or GMV came in at $37.3 billion, reflecting 114% year-over-year growth and besting the analyst’s call by 11%.', 'According to management, the strong result was driven by growing traction and integration across social media platforms, as well as additional international expansion. International GMV growth exceeded that of North America, which implies “SHOP’s growth was more than just a U.S. stimulus check dynamic,” in Aftahi’s opinion.', '“While SHOP may not be able to outgrow its upcoming ~90%+ topline growth rates, it appears clear the company is continuing to gain market share and grow on the outskirts of the pandemic… International expansion acts as one of the major upside catalysts for SHOP where it will begin to invest more directly, and its portfolio of merchant solutions, internationally, has barely scratched the surface, beyond payments,” Aftahi commented.', 'With this in mind, the analyst bumped up his forecast for FY21 revenue by roughly 3%.', '“When we look at multiple catalysts through international expansion and organic plan upgrades to Plus, alongside commentary April GMV has been on-par with 1Q trends, we see growth remaining quite healthy for this best-in-class e-commerce/tech name,” Aftahi said.', 'Landing among the top 66 analysts tracked by TipRanks, Aftahi boasts an impressive 44.5% average return per rating.', 'Following its 1Q21 earnings release, Oppenheimer’s Timothy Horan sees Cogent Communications as a compelling play within the internet, ethernet and colocation services space.

In addition, gross margin was up by 200 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter.', 'Looking ahead, management gave long-term, multi-year targets of 10% annualized revenue growth and 200 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. As a result, post-earnings, Horan is “incrementally more positive on growth.”', 'When it comes to the netcentric business, it has bounced back to growth thanks to international expansion and retreating customers. What’s more, according to the Oppenheimer analyst, corporate customers have been forced to close branch offices due to the pandemic. However, after peaking in the middle of the fourth quarter, churn has seen a significant improvement, with corporate purchasing activity (DIA) also getting a boost. To this end, the analyst estimates corporate revenues will gain 2% to 3% quarter-over-quarter when stabilized.', 'It should also be noted that this stock trades at a 3.6% free cash flow yield, which is “attractive” in Horan’s opinion, for a name “growing free cash flow in the mid-20% range over the next two years.” The company is also making an effort to cut costs and increase unit growth, “supported by its low-cost positioning.”', 'Summing it all up, Horan stated, “Fundamentals are improving as we exit the pandemic and CCOI trades at an attractive valuation, which has created a buying opportunity. Long-term, we think the company is positioned to take share in both corporate (~20% market share today) and netcentric (~25% market share today) as the low-cost provider of internet services in a commoditized market.”   ', 'Supporting his position on TipRanks’ ranking of best-performing analysts, Horan has achieved a 67% success rate and 17.5% average return per rating.', 'Cirrus Logic’s high valuation and concentration of revenues from Apple had previously kept Needham’s Rajvindra Gill on the sidelines.

This target suggests that shares could gain 31% in the year ahead.', 'Although Gill acknowledges that the recent earnings results and guidance were “disappointing,” he points out that “the numbers were attributed to revenue recognition timing, where the company is selling camera controllers for use in camera modules, where lead times are shorter than the rest of components, and thus are shipped earlier.”', 'Further explaining his bullish thesis, Gill noted, “New opportunities are emerging, including potential content gains at Apple with a new Power IC (with a $1 ASP). Net, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in FY22 and believe stock is compelling here.”', 'Looking at the analyst’s current iPhone dollar content estimates, they land at about $4.20 ($5.20 with an additional $1 ASP for the Power IC). This is set to be integrated into iPhones in Fall 2021.', 'Additionally, CRUS is working to expand beyond the audio domain with its high-performance mixed-signal chips. According to Gill, the “22nm chips could translate to either more digital processing closer to the analog or a radically smaller or more power efficient chip.”', 'What’s more, the company is making a significant effort to grab market share with Android-based phones with haptic controllers.

Highlighting Combat Systems in particular, it saw a 6% gain in the quarter. He added, “In addition, Marine’s long-term visibility on platforms such as the Virginia and Columbia class submarines, the defense business becomes an execution story in the medium-term.”', 'On top of this, the defense backlog is currently at more than $77 billion, which equates to roughly 2.6 years of related segment revenue. According to Arment, this will be supported by recurring submarine awards as well as a “growing pipeline” in Technologies, which closed out the quarter with $30 billion in proposals.', 'Although commercial aerospace demand recovery has been slower, bizjets are an entirely different story, with flight activity spiking. “As travel restrictions ease internationally, we expect activity to pick up further and aid out-year results,” Arment commented.', 'It should also be noted that even though aerospace profitability will be under pressure this year, Arment believes this will reverse in 2022, with higher volume expected.', '“Paired with an improving top and bottom line at Aerospace, we see potential for GD to return to its premium stance amongst the primes,” the Baird analyst opined.', 'Overall, Arment has delivered a 64% success rate and 13.8% average return per rating.']",19

', '“We expect strong earnings upside to Samsung Electronics’ (SEC) earnings in 3Q20, led by the set device (mobile and TV) division,” Kim said in a note. “In addition, we see multiple catalysts for SEC in 2021 on opportunities from 5G, memory and foundry, which should drive a rebound in its share price, in our view.”', 'Samsung shares hit an all-time intraday high of 62,800 Korean won ($52.84) in mid-January on hopes of a strong 2020. But after the coronavirus pandemic spread globally, shares fell as low as 42,300 Korean won ($35.59) in March, amid the broader global market sell-off. Since then, the stock has recovered, but is still below January’s record high.', 'Part of the pressure on shares has also come from weakness in the prices of DRAM, a type of memory semiconductor that is a key driver of Samsung’s business.

Meanwhile, he forecasts operating profit to come in at 10.5 trillion Korean won ($8.83 billion), up 29% on the quarter and 35% higher on the year. That is above market expectations. ', '“While we assume SEC to maintain cost savings amid COVID-19, we expect a sharp rebound in sales of smartphones and TVs to drive robust earnings upside in 3Q20,” Kim said.', 'Samsung could sell 79 million smartphones, up 46% quarter-on-quarter, according to Kim. ', 'Kim said he forecasts that profit for the two business units that house smartphones and TVs will outgrow the component division, which includes semiconductors and displays, for the first time since the second quarter of 2016.

', '“It seems Samsung is benefitting from Huawei’s woes in Europe and Latam and anti-China sentiment in India,” Rana told CNBC by email.', 'Indeed, while Huawei managed to become the number one smartphone maker in the second quarter and overtake Samsung for the first time, it did so by gaining a huge market share in China. Meanwhile, its performance in international markets took a hit. Huawei is feeling the effects of U.S. sanctions which have cut off its access to Google Android on its most recent flagship handsets. ', 'Huawei said on Thursday that it would bring its own operating system, HarmonyOS, to its smartphones next year. ', 'Samsung released two high-end smartphones in the last few weeks.

', 'In the third quarter, Rana in his note said that there has been a rush of orders from Huawei and other smartphones makers looking to “benefit from Huawei’s woes” for memory chips. That has led to so-called DRAM inventory to remain “stable,” giving Samsung an “edge in contract ASP (average selling price) negotiations” with device manufacturers. A stable supply is better than too much supply as it allows Samsung to have higher bargaining power on prices.', 'Kim said that trends including upgraded processing units in servers and the release of new gaming consoles will also help Samsung’s gaming division. Both Sony and Microsoft are releasing flagship consoles this year. ', 'Samsung is also one of the leading chip foundries. That means it manufactures semiconductors for other firms. Earlier this month, Nvidia launched a new range of GeForce RTX 30 Series of graphics processing units (GPUs) and chose Samsung to manufacture them. ', 'Analysts are expecting more major deals in other non-memory areas. ', 'CLSA’s Rana forecasts non-memory revenue to increase to 30 trillion Korean won ($25.24 billion) by 2022 versus 18 trillion this year with operating profit nearly doubling over this period to 3.8 trillion won ($3.2 billion).

It was not immediately clear whether Tesla would make similar changes to cars manufactured in or shipped to the U.S.', 'The omission indicates that Tesla had to make changes beyond what the company has publicly revealed to keep its factories and sales going from the final weeks of 2021 on, as the world faced an ongoing chip shortage that has affected everything from cars to laptop computers. It also means Tesla can’t turn all its existing cars into driverless vehicles with a mere software update, undercutting what CEO Elon Musk recently said on an earnings call:', '“My personal guess is that we’ll achieve Full Self-Driving this year at a safety level significantly greater than a person. So the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self-driving via software update, I think, might end up being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history. We shall see.”', 'Internally, Tesla employees said that adding “level 3” functionality, which would allow a driver to use their Tesla hands-free without steering in normal driving scenarios, would need the dual electronic control unit system and therefore require a retrofit at a service visit. They also said that the exclusion would not cause safety issues, since the removed part was deemed a secondary electronic control unit, used mainly as a backup.', 'At the time this manufacturing change was underway in Shanghai, CEO Elon Musk wrote in a tweet: “Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it’s not over!”', 'Tesla has struggled with manufacturing challenges throughout its history, but the completion of its Shanghai factory in 2019 helped it increase production, expand margins, and gain market share beyond North America. This latest decision reveals new pressures as the company pushes further into the mainstream, and aims to deliver on Elon Musk’s promises of a self-driving future.', 'Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on this story.', 'The specific item omitted is an electronic control unit in the electric power assisted steering systems, which translate steering wheel movements into wheel turns on the street.', 'Before cars used so many electronic components, vehicles would rely on a pump, steering rack, and pinion to translate steering wheel movements into turns.', 'Richard Wallace, principal advisor for HWA Analytics in Ann Arbor and veteran transportation safety researcher, explains how that’s changed.', '“There’s still a mechanical component of course. But in today’s vehicles, when you ‘turn the wheel’ you are providing an electronic signal telling your car to go left or right.”', 'Electric power assisted steering systems today also enable driver assistance features, Wallace notes, like the ability to automatically keep a car in the center of a lane.', 'Tesla removed the component because engineers deemed it redundant, primarily installed as a backup. Omitting the control unit will also save Tesla money near-term, as long as no problems arise as a result of the altered system.', 'There’s some precedent for the company removing options or components for business reasons. For example, last spring, Tesla removed lumbar support from passenger seats in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to lower costs.', 'On January 26, 2021, Musk said during an earnings call that Tesla had faced down a “chip hell of many chips” in 2021. The company had a hard time obtaining “the little chip that allows you to move your seat back and forth,” he noted, along with other “basic chips.”', 'He did not mention the altered power steering systems.', 'Other automakers have taken similar steps, but typically make temporary cuts to options that aren’t part of a vehicle’s core functionality.', 'For example, in March 2021, General Motors said it was building some of its 2021 light-duty pickup trucks without a fuel management module, a move that hurt those trucks’ fuel economy. It blamed the chip shortage for the move.', 'Tesla currently offers several levels of driver assistance functionality in its cars. A basic version, dubbed Autopilot, comes with every car. Drivers can also buy a more advanced version, called Full Self-Driving, or FSD, for $12,000 or $199 a month (in the U.S.).', 'When Tesla made the decision to exclude an electronic control unit from its steering racks, there was an internal discussion about whether to notify customers, two employees told CNBC. These people asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company.', 'Employees also discussed whether omitting the part would degrade any functionality in or reliability of customers’ cars. They worried whether the “depop,” or exclusion, of this component may interfere with customers’ ability to use FSD features.', 'Ultimately, they decided the tweak did not rise to the level of customer notification -- at least until Tesla is ready to launch “level 3,” or hands-free driver assistance features.', 'Tesla vehicles can still use the current “level 2” versions of its driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (or FSD), without the dual-control steering system.', 'But employees told CNBC if Tesla launches a more sophisticated FSD update, owners with the affected cars who use that premium system will need to get a steering rack retrofit from a Tesla service center.', 'Generally, Tesla relies on service technicians to install missing parts or to repair or replace broken parts, before a car is delivered to a customer, making service a kind of extended arm of Tesla manufacturing.', 'Most of the cars with the single electronic control unit were going to customers in China initially, where FSD is not seeing significant uptake. According to internal communications seen by CNBC, just over 1% of all Tesla customers in China opted for the premium driver assistance package at the time they placed an order for a new car.', 'More recently, tens of thousands of the affected vehicles were exported to customers beyond China, including in Australia, the UK, Germany and throughout Europe, employees told CNBC.', 'CNBC asked HWA Analytics’ Richard Wallace whether removing an electronic control unit from a power steering system in a modern vehicle could pose a safety risk.', '“If something like a chip or an ECU is not providing additional functionality, if it is truly redundant, you may be able to turn it off or leave it out. With chips and software, there’s a little bit of wiggle room. I can reassign stuff here and there,” he said.', 'Much depends on a vehicle’s computing architecture, said IHS Markit Senior Principal Analyst Phil Amsrud.', 'He said, “I cannot think of a case where an automaker would say ‘You know what? We’ll take a component out of that module, even though it was there for a good reason and we’ll hope nothing happens.’ Going from a dual chip to a single chip variant in a vehicle can make a system simpler and make it better in some cases. But they’d really need to do a lot of validation.”', 'Most automakers would spend 1,000 hours on testing or more to make any big changes, he estimated. That can take upwards of four months. It can also take years for quality or safety issues to become clear after changes are made.', 'Tesla employees told CNBC that the company spent less than a few weeks discussing the change before moving ahead and didn’t view it as a big deal -- more of a chip-famine survival tactic.', 'The company had previously produced earlier models that featured a power steering system with only one electronic control unit, and that gave them greater confidence. So too did Tesla’s frequently touted ability to push software updates “over-the-air” to vehicles to refine their functionality if needed.']",104

But earlier in this month, Tokyo unexpectedly imposed tighter controls on one portion of that network: The supply of certain chemicals from Japan to South Korea.', 'Those chemicals are used by Korean manufacturers to produce semiconductors, and are crucial for making components — including memory chips, microprocessors and integrated circuits — that can be found in many modern-day electronic products.', 'Given the widespread use of semiconductors, companies that test and make them are often seen as a barometer for the health of the global economy.', 'Global sales of semiconductors grew 12.5% to reach $474.6 billion in 2018, according to research firm Gartner. Signs are pointing to falling sales this year with several large semiconductor companies slashing earnings estimates amid deteriorating demand.', '', 'Already, the U.S. and China are locked in a year-long trade war that has dampened the global growth outlook. Now with tensions between Japan and South Korea also heating up, it could make things worse.', '“The ongoing trade dispute between Japan and South Korea could have serious consequences to the global semiconductor industry if a resolution cannot be identified in the near term,” Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at consultancy IHS Markit, wrote in a note last week.', 'Japan announced on July 1 it would restrict exports of three chemicals to South Korea: fluorinated polyimide, resist and hydrogen fluoride. Those high-tech materials are used in the production of semiconductors and display screens. Tokyo cited “inadequate management” of the chemicals — which some reports said could be diverted for military use — as a reason to impose restrictions.', 'The curbs came into effect on July 4 and Japanese exporters must now seek permission each time they want to ship any of the three chemicals to South Korea. That process takes about 90 days.', 'In addition, Tokyo said it plans to strip South Korea off some preferential treatment in its trade ties with Japan. Such a move, which is expected by August, would involve removing South Korea from a “white list” of countries deemed trustworthy by Japan.', 'If Tokyo goes ahead with its plan, Japanese exporters will need licenses to ship to South Korea some 850 items that could be used in weapons-related applications, according to IHS Markit.', 'Japan produces around 90% of the world’s supply of fluorinated polyimide and resists, and about 70% of hydrogen fluoride. Japan’s global dominance of those chemicals will make it difficult for South Korean companies to source for alternatives when their supplies are disrupted by Tokyo’s exports curbs.', 'Even if they manage to find alternative sources, the companies “may either encounter quality issues or fail to get adequate supplies to fulfill their production orders,” according to a report last week by Lloyd Chan and Shigeto Nagai, economists at consultancy Oxford Economics.', '', 'South Korea is home to semiconductor giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, which supplied 61% of components used in memory chips globally in 2018, IHS Markit said.

They didn’t provide inventory figures for SK Hynix, but cited a local media report as saying the company told customers “the current situation is manageable near-term.”', '', 'Still, any prolonged disruption of Japanese exports of the crucial chemicals to South Korea could cause a global shortfall in memory chips supply, and as a result, push up prices, warned Biswas from IHS Markit.', 'There could be a contagion effect, and the U.S. and China might also feel the pain given that both countries rely on supplies from South Korea, the economist noted. American electronics firms with production sites in both the U.S. and China, or either one of the two countries, are especially vulnerable, he said.', '“If supply constraints arise in South Korean memory chip production, the price of memory components could significantly increase due to the inability of the other memory suppliers to meet global demand,” said Biswas.', '“End products, including servers, mobile handsets, PCs and a variety of consumer electronics would be impacted,” he added.', 'As a result, consumers from all over the world may have to pay a higher price for those products.', 'Relations between Japan and South Korea have not always been warm.
