But in all likelihood, we won’t.', 'The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives — when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms — Americans turned to their government for a fix.', 'In the last half-century, lawmakers and regulators set up a regime to improve the safety of automobiles and other manufactured goods, to break up a telephone monopoly that controlled much of the nation’s communications and to loosen the fatal grip that tobacco companies held over American society.', 'We are now at another great turning point in the global economy. A handful of technology companies, the Frightful Five — Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, the largest American corporations by stock-market value — control the technological platforms that will dominate life for the foreseeable future.', 'Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.', 'Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants’ power through government — and, if so, how.', 'There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year’s presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.', 'On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five — Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech. And, as my colleague Cecilia Kang notes, media, telecom and other industries are pushing these arguments on both sides.', 'But there is little to suggest we’ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.', '“Individuals, lawmakers, we’re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,” said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.', 'Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)', '“Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,” Mr. Lynn said. “Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I’d bet a lot of money a year from now we’ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.”', 'More from The New York Times:', 'Square, the Twitter Boss’s Other Company, Could Pass It in ValueCisco and Google Find Mutual Interest in Cloud ComputingRussia’s Favored Outlet Is an Online News Giant.

Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we’ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They’re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.', 'They’re creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence — a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.', 'But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets — Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.', 'Apple’s iPhone is the world’s most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.', 'Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon’s annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmart’s sun.', 'Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five’s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.', '“We’ve all become a bit cyborg,” writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in “World Without Mind,” one of several new books examining the giants. “What we need to always remember is that we’re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.”', 'The complicated nature of the Five’s power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.', 'Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon’s growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.', 'Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it’s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn’t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.', 'That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year’s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn’t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.', 'Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.', '“We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,” said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.', 'Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company’s culture — which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.', 'A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants. But that’s a big if.', '“The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?” Mr. Reback said. “Had we been more diligent, we wouldn’t have nearly the problems we have today.”', 'Follow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter @fmanjoo']",-1

When somebody is shooting at that rate, the police force may have saved maybe even hundreds of lives by reacting as fast as they did. You’ve got 325 million people in this country, and a certain percentage of them, their brains don’t work like brains should.', '[On current market valuations]', 'Well, valuations make sense with interest rates where they are. I mean, in the end you measure laying out money for an asset in relation to what you are going to get back, and the number one yard stick is U.S. governments.', 'When you get 2.30 on the ten-year, I think stocks will do considerably better than that. If I have a choice of the two, I’m going to take stocks at that point. On the other hand, if interest rates were on the ten-year were five or six, you know, a whole different valuation standard for stocks. And we’ve talked about that for some time now.', 'Interest rates are gravity. If we knew interest rates were going to be zero from now until judgment day, you could pay a lot of money for any other asset. You would not want to put your money out at zero. I would have thought back in 19 -- I mean, 2009 that rates would not be this low eight years later. It’s been a powerful factor, and the longer it persists, the more people start thinking in terms of something close to the rates they’ve seen for a long time. The one thing I’m sure of is that over time stocks from this level will beat bonds from this level. If I can be short the 30-year bond at 3 percent or something and long the S&P 500 and just have it put away for 30 years, stocks are going to far outperform bonds. The question is which variable is going to change. Everybody expects interest rates to change. But they’ve been expecting that for quite a while.', 'I don’t try to guess the stock market: I find businesses I like. But if I were to guess: if interest rates -- if the ten-year moved up to 5 percent, stocks would be somewhat cheaper.', 'It’s been so wide I’ve written about it in annual reports. Stocks have been so much more attractive than bonds for a long time now and that’s partly intentional on the part of the fed. I mean, they want assets to increase in value and the way to do it was to reduce that gravity force of higher interest rates.', 'I think they expect it to increase, but the question is how much. If three years from now interest rates are 100 basis points higher than this, stocks will still be cheap at these prices. If it’s 300 or 400 basis points, they won’t look cheap. Janet Yellen doesn’t know what she would do three years from now. She’s got more of a job than --that’s a simple factor of the stock market. It’s interesting because the fed has said that they would like to see 2% inflation. That’s fairly recent.

It wouldn’t do any good to think about [who will be the next Fed chairman].', 'I wouldn’t know the answer in the end.

But we don’t pay any attention to it. If they really think they could figure it out, they might as well play the bond market. They don’t really have to get over to the stock market. I can’t remember a decision we’ve ever made based on the Fed, except for the fact that I felt that Bernanke and Paulson and Geithner, but I felt the Fed would do the right thing in the fall of 2008.

If something happens that changes the tax rate significantly on January 1st, it would pay me something -- assuming that they would reduce rates on capital gains or corporate rates. It would pay me to sell the losses now and defer the gains until next year. I think there’s a lot of that going on because I think there’s an expectation that if they reduce -- that if they have a tax act, it will be -- they will cut the rates -- certainly corporate rates. It would be kind of foolish to have a gain now and pay 35% tax on it if by waiting a few months you were likely to pay 25%.', 'So it actually very seldom enters into our thinking.', 'On balance we would rather sell things with losses than gains.

While bilateral trade issues were discussed, it appears the recent spat over Canadian dairy products didn’t come up.', 'Regardless, the status of NAFTA looms large for both countries, with much bigger things than milk or lumber hanging in the balance. The Trump administration formally notified Congress May 18 that it would initiate negotiations with Canada and Mexico to modernize NAFTA. That sets into motion a 90-day countdown for the first formal round of negotiations, and the administration expects to hold the first such talks no earlier than Aug. 16.', 'U.S. agriculture leaders are closely watching efforts to change the 23-year-old agreement, which some claim is unfair to American producers of dairy as well as fresh produce growers. Others, however, disagree: They suggest the North American Free Trade Agreement’s benefits include increasing overall trade and boosting demand for U.S. pork, corn and even California wine.', 'The Trump administration has accused Canada of essentially shutting out U.S. dairy producers in so-called ultrafiltered milk, which is used to make cheese, yogurt and ice cream. The president called the Canadian action “a disgrace” in April and also tweeted about it: “Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult.”', 'Canadians reject claims the incentives they have to buy domestic milk concentrates are protectionism and argue they shouldn’t be blamed for excess milk capacity by American dairy producers.', 'Speaking to reporters Saturday at the G-7, Trudeau was pressed on NAFTA specifics he had discussed with Trump. The Canadian prime minister said they “talked about a broad range of issues,” going on to list softwood lumber, aerospace and steel but he never mentioned dairy trade.', 'Agriculture is only a small part of NAFTA, with electronics, automotive and aerospace manufacturing also seen as critical elements of the renegotiation.', 'In a statement from Trudeau’s office, the two “reaffirmed their commitment to the deepest economic partnership in the world. Trade between our countries supports job creation on both sides of the border and the growth of the middle class, and in 2016 was valued at nearly $882 billion.”', 'Playing out in the background, however, are concerns about whether North America will remain a bastion of free trade. Last week, the National Pork Producers Council released a white paper on the benefits of NAFTA, and pointed out that Mexico is the second-largest export market for U.S. pork, and Canada is the fourth-largest market.', '“Disrupting U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada would have devastating consequences for our farmers and the many American processing and transportation industries and workers supported by these exports,” the white paper said.', 'Nonetheless, Trump has remained steadfast in its criticism of NAFTA.', '“The fact is NAFTA, whether it’s Mexico or Canada, is a disaster for our country,” Trump said in April.', 'However, Canada and Mexico were the first- and second-largest foreign markets for U.S. goods in 2016. Exports to Canada totaled about $266 billion in 2016, while Mexico was $231 billion.', '“Canada is by far and away the bigger partner,” said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics in Los Angeles. “We actually import more from Mexico than we export.”', 'For California, agricultural exports to Canada have more than tripled in the past 15 years, and exports to Mexico have had similar results, according to state figures. California-produced nuts are the top export to Canada in dollar value followed by wine. Canada also is the top foreign market for many of California’s popular fruits and vegetables.', 'The Wine Institute, a San Francisco-based trade group representing California wineries, said California wines are the most popular import table wine category in Canada and beat even French wines. Also, under NAFTA, wine exports to Mexico have grown sharply, but still remain small when compared with Canada.', 'Yet the Wine Institute said in a letter last month to the U.S. Commerce Department that there are several challenges it still faces when entering the Canadian market.', '“Canada maintains discriminatory and burdensome nontariff trade barriers impeding U.S. wine exports,” Tom LaFaille, vice president and international trade counsel for the wine group said in the letter commenting on trade deficits. For example, he pointed out that some provinces in Canada have “rules denying equal access for U.S. wines to grocery stores.”', 'Meanwhile, Mexico — a frequent source of Trump’s ire — is also taking some heat. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in April called on the Trump administration to investigate “Mexico’s unfair trade practices” as it relates to specialty crops.', '“Unfortunately, the current trade environment created under NAFTA is anything but a fair and level playing field for Florida’s producers,” he said. ', 'Regardless of its flaws, most major U.S. ag groups support modernizing NAFTA and do not want to see it ditched.', '“Mexico and Canada are two of our largest export markets for the commodities and products raised on U.S. farms and ranches,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall in a statement released after Congress was notified of the NAFTA renegotiation. “America’s farmers and ranchers value them as customers and trade partners.”', 'Corn and corn product exports today account for just more than 30 percent of U.S. farmer income, and Mexico is the top export market for corn while Canada is also a major market for corn as well as ethanol, according to the National Corn Growers Association.', 'Some Mexico lawmakers have suggested the country should switch to buying corn from Argentina, a move that would be a blow to U.S. farmers in the Corn Belt states where Trump enjoyed strong support during the election.', 'Indeed, Mexico is looking to reduce its dependence on its northern neighbor, even though there is close proximity to the U.S. and easy access via rail, truck and ports.', '“Our first strategy is to continue shipping to the U.S. market,” said Ramon Paz, a strategic advisor for the Avocado Producers and Exporting Packers Association of Mexico. “Our second strategy is diversify — and we are working on that too.”', 'Paz just spent a week in China and said that market is the “most attractive” from a future standpoint. He also said Mexican avocado producers are returning to the European market and also doing more promotions to push growth in Japan, the third-largest market after the U.S. and Canada.', 'According to Paz, nearly 40 percent of the avocado exports come from Mexico packinghouses that are subsidiaries of U.S. companies. He said these packing facilities provide benefits to U.S. investors, and keep avocados supplied year-round to U.S consumers.', '“There is no harm for the California producers but benefits actually,” Paz said. “Imports of avocados from Mexico have increased demand in such a way that nowadays California producers sell all they can produce.”', 'Paz said avocado producers in California are “getting more money for their crop” given the strong demand today for the fruit.']",1

We issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have.', 'You go to other countries, and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations. They are a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. I want regulations because I want safety. I want environmental, all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. You don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.', 'We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We’re not going to let it happen any longer. We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.', '[I] met with general, now Secretary Kelly, yesterday, and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we’re going to have a wall that works. We’re not going to have a wall like they have now that is either nonexistent or a joke. We ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are.', 'We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. Court system has not made it easy for us. And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, an unsafe ruling.', 'Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters — and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defending our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result, they already are. I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I’ve heard 80 percent, I find that hard believe. That’s just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is — that circuit in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil.', 'But we are appealing that and we are going further. We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people and that’ll be done sometime next week in the beginning or middle at the latest part.', 'We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone pipeline and Dakota Access pipelines, thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of the government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn, and they didn’t say that and I’m reading the order and I say why aren’t we using American steel? They said, that’s a good idea. We put it in.', 'To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington D.C., I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials, and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.', 'We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It’s a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare. They fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the republican people that our representatives are representing. So, we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. Bring our jobs back to this country, big league.', 'It’s already happening. Big league. ', 'I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before. General Kelly. We have great, great people, makers with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.', 'Now look, fair trade. Not free. Fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore. You know, every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t, but for the most part, that would be a tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan creating 2,000 new american jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know, you were here. General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave, and if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left, and these jobs, these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.', 'Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Wal-mart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. They’ll be many, many more, many more. These are a few that we’re naming.  Other countries have been taken advantage of us for decades, decades, and decades and decades, folks, and we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.', 'And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our constitution. Highly respected. Should get the vote from the Democrats. You may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or another. He should get there the old fashioned way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it, there’s never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time, and we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we’re just getting started. We will be giving a speech as I said in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 p.m., I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say God bless America, and let’s take some questions.', 'Mara? Mara, go ahead, you were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.', 'Reporter: [ inaudible ]', 'Mike Flynn is a wonderful person, and I asked for resignation, he respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who’s with us today, and I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn’t have to do that because what he did wasn’t wrong. What he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves, in this room, were given that information. Because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem.', 'You know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all, you know,  “fake news” fabricated deal to try to make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people supposedly involved with all of this. They know nothing about it, never in Russia, never made a phone call, never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news.', 'The nice thing is I see it starting to turn where people are now looking at the illegal — I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information, and let me just tell you, it was given out so much.', 'For example, I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential classified call, but I called Mexico, and in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s nice, I spoke to the president of Mexico, had a good call, all the sudden it’s out there for the world to see. It was supposed to be secret.', 'Supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case, same thing with Australia. All of the sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this.', 'And I’m saying, the first thing I thought of when I heard about it, is how does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves, but more importantly, the people that gave out information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really a shame.', 'Trump: Yes, go ahead.', 'Reporter: Why did you keep your vice president in the dark for almost two weeks?', 'Trump: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, looked at the information, and he said, “huh, that’s fine.” That’s what they are supposed to do.', 'They are supposed to be — he just didn’t call Russia, he called, and spoke to both ways, I think, there were 30-some odd countries, just doing his job. You know, he was just doing his job.', 'The thing is he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember, so either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision, but he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember, and that just wasn’t acceptable to me. Yes?', 'Reporter: Since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence, and if so, what was the nature of the conversations?', 'Trump: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big long front page story yesterday, and it was very much discredited, as you know. It was— it’s a joke. The people mentioned in the story, I noticed they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.', 'They weren’t even a part, really, I mean, there was such a minor part. I had not spoken to them—I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him or ever met him, and he actually said he was a very low level member of, I think, committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him.', 'Now it’s possible I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I never met him, I never talked to him ever, and he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call, looked at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera, and the other person people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but represented various countries. That’s what he does. People know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, by the way, a respected man, a respected man, but I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people... and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. He said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it forcefully. Most of the papers do not print it because it’s not good for their stories.', 'So the three people they talked about all totally deny it, and I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia.', 'President Putin called me up nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific, but so did almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.', 'That’s the exception. Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that there are people probably from the Obama administration because they are there. We have new people going in place right now, as you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA, James Comey at the FBI, Dan Coates is waiting to be approved. I mean, he’s a senator, a highly respected one, and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.', 'Just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, the Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times story yesterday. And it talked about — you saw it, front page — so director of national intelligence just put out, acting, a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community — this was just given to us — is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.', 'So they took this front page story out of the Wall Street Journal top, and they just wrote the story, but it’s not true.', 'I’ll tell you something. I’ll be honest. I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but never seen more dishonest media than frankly the political media. I thought the financial media was much better and more honest, but I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.', 'How do they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me or how do they write a story in the New York Times put it on the front page. That was the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And It was nasty. And then they called, they said, we never said that. We like Mr. Trump. They called up my office. We like Mr. Trump. We never said that.', 'And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women. I have to tell you. Totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction, and, frankly, I then went on to other things.', 'Okay. Go ahead.', 'Reporter: Mr. President, you said today that you have biggest electoral margins since Reagan with 350 electoral votes, and, in fact, president Obama got 365 -- [Trump mumbles in response] why should America — [ Trump tries to protest in response] why should America trust you when you accuse the — [ inaudible ]', 'Trump: Actually, I’ve seen that information around. It was a substantial difference, do you agree with that?', 'Reporter: You’re the president.', 'Trump: Okay. [laughing]', 'Reporter: Can you tell us, can you determine that General Flynn never wronged you? What evidence — did you ask your transcripts [inaudible] you said you’d aggressively pursue [inaudible]', 'Trump: We are.', 'Reporter: [inaudible] review of the intelligence community — what can you tell us?', 'Trump: First of all, about that. We now have Dan Coates, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo, and James Comey, and they are in position, so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, a very successful man, and he’s offered his services, and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of, but I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that, you know, I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out easily on its own.', 'As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong. You know, really didn’t think — really what happened after that — but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and thought about it. Well, I said I don’t see, to me, he was doing the job.', 'The information was provided by, who I don’t know, Sally Yates, and I was a little surprised because I said, “Doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there,” but he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought it was not acceptable as far as, as far as, the actual making the call. In fact, I’ve watched various programs, and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal.', 'You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So, and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man. Yes, john?', 'Reporter: What will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today [inaudible]', 'Trump: I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks.', 'They’re put out by people either in agencies you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved and just as an example. So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act.', 'You know what I say, when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Cause all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was, honestly, I was really, really surprised.', 'But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen. But that wasn’t that important to call. It was fine. I could show it to the world, and he could show it to the world, the president, who is a very fine man, by the way, same thing with Australia.', 'I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked, but it was not that important. But then I said to myself, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information? Very important, very, you know, I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?', 'So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public. In a way, that was almost a test, so I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina. We were dealing with this case on Mike Flynn, all the information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times, and I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I deal on the Middle East? What’s happening when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?', 'We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty. Yes? John?', 'Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify, because it’s a very important point, can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign, and on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?', 'Trump: Well, the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said. You saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.', 'So one thing that I felt it was very important to do, and I hope we can correct it, because there’s nobody I have more respect for— well, maybe a little bit, but than reporters, than good reporters. It’s very important to me. Especially in this position. It’s very important.', 'I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and over the course of time, I’ll make mistakes, and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with it. But I’m not okay when it is fake.', 'I mean I watch CNN, and it’s so much anger, hatred, and just the hatred, I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying now, it’s okay, Jim, you’ll have a chance.

People, you have a lower approval rate than Congress — I think that’s right, I don’t know Peter is that one right? I think they have, I think I heard lower than Congress. But, honestly, the public would appreciate it. I would appreciate it.', 'I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true, but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval in the cabinet. Numbers are crazy. Some of them had them approved immediately. I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.', 'And that’s all they’re doing is delaying. You look at Schumer the mess that he’s got over there. And they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay.

That’s fine. I think it would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it. And everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jim.', 'Reporter: The first part of my question is can you definitively say [inaudible]', 'Trump: I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.', 'Now, when Wikileaks — which I have nothing to do with —comes out and happens to give, they are not giving classified information. They are giving stuff, what was said in an office about Hillary cheating on the debates, which, by the way, nobody mentions.', 'Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine, seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair, okay? He should be put in the electric chair and you’d even call for the reconstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, John. Yes, you next.', 'Reporter: Mr. President, I just want to clarify an important point, I think. Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador? Prior to your inauguration? Would you have fired him if that information hadn’t leaked out?', 'Trump: I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries, his counterparts, so it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he was not doing it. I did not direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. It came out that way, and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say, he was doing his job. And I agreed with him.', 'Since then, I’ve watched many other people say that. You know, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he did not do it, okay?

In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. If John Podesta said that about me and working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But It was not classified information. In one case, you are talking about classified.

At my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.', 'I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and failed.', 'The DNC did not do that. If they did it, they could not have been hacked. They were hacked. Terrible things came in.

Nobody talks about that.', 'I didn’t do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of the uranium.

Now, if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy, but if we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing.

And probably Putin said, you know, he’s sitting behind his desk saying, you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, they follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story. Okay? And that’s a shame.

Frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner, so well submitting health care sometime in mid-March, and after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform, yes.', 'Reporter: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.

The order seeks “extreme vetting” procedures for those  it did allow to enter the U.S. In signing the order, Trump said  he pledged to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United  States of America.”', '  “We spent the first two months [following the election] focusing  on the positives for companies.

But markets probably will not yet get much in the way of  clues on how quickly the new administration will push the tax and  growth policies that have driven both stocks and interest rates  higher.', '  Trump is expected to make the repeal of Obamacare a priority. He  is also seen moving quickly on the topics of trade with Mexico,  immigration and regulations in areas like energy. However, it’s  less likely that there will be much new on the programs markets  care about most since they also must wind through Congress.', '  As traders fixate on Washington, there are also about 20 percent  of the S&P 500 companies reporting in the coming week,  including Alphabet, Boeing, Caterpillar, Microsoft and  McDonald’s. Of the S&P companies already reporting, 65  percent have beaten earnings estimates, and earnings growth based  on the reports and estimates looks to be 6.5 percent for the  fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.', '  Traders had hoped Trump would play up the pro-growth agenda  during his inaugural address Friday. Instead, he focused on the  theme of putting America first in a speech that had a strong  protectionist ring.', '  “I expect volatility to be a little bit higher in the first 100  days than it was in the last part of 2016, when there was a sigh  of relief and focus was more on the macro and the hopes for the  macro,” said Kate Moore, BlackRock chief equity strategist.  “We’re going to have a lot more volatility, as some of this  policy gets ironed out and we get more clarity.”', '  She said it could take a while to see what tax reform will look  like. ', '  “I think we will get a little more clarity and then it’s very  likely we will have a slightly better road map when it comes to  taxes over the next two months. I think that’s going to be  hugely important. We will have more comments and certainly more  sense of the road map when it comes to trade,” she said.', '  Moore said one of Trump’s most important comments in the past  week was that the dollar is too strong. A strong dollar hurts  corporate profits and hurts emerging markets.', '  “The main takeaway I had from Trump and his comments on the  dollar … was an acknowledgment that we don’t want the dollar  to be too strong, going into trade negotiations,” said Moore. She  said long dollar is a very crowded trade and she does  not believe it will appreciate as much as many expect. That’s  simply because the global is improving and differences in  monetary policy and growth between the U.S. and other regions  won’t be as great.', '  Moore said she’s neutral on U.S. stocks and would become more  bullish if earnings continue to improve and there’s more clarity  around policy from Washington. She said there is a lot of reason  for more dispersion on stock performance. “It’s going to be from  growth, inflation, policy and [Trump’s] tweets and very likely  how effective companies have been in containing their costs and  managing to maintain their margins at this point,” she said. “It  seems to me there are a lot of reasons for differentiation at  this point.”', '  Stocks in the past week were flattish, with the S&P 500 down  0.2 percent at 2,271, and the Dow was about 0.3 percent lower at  19,827. Treasury yields had a big move in the past week, with the 10-year nearly  touching 2.30 percent and rising to 2.50 percent by Friday.', '  Moore likes small caps and also emerging markets. “I think the  fears of a trade war are overblown. It’s one of the reasons we  continued to be maintaining a constructive outlook for emerging  markets,” she said.', '  She said Trump’s inaugural comments Friday were “downbeat” and  it was disappointing that he pointed to problems in the economy  when there is near full employment and earnings growth is picking  up.', '  The fact Trump’s comments sounded protectionist unsettled some in  the markets who were hoping he would sound more traditional and  not as if he could start a trade war. Economists put trade  concerns at the top of the list of what could change the growth  outlook.', '  “By far the number one issue on the global economy in the next  year is how far down the path of trade tensions do we go here,  and mixed into those is also geopolitical tensions as well. So do  we have a gradual process, where there’s some concession on all  sides and things will move smoothly, or do things get very heated  and people start to worry about serious back-and-forth tariffs?”  said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America  Merrill Lynch. ', '  Trump is expected to  open talks with Mexico and Canada on the  North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in place  since the 1990s. He has called for tariffs on Mexican produced  goods though he is not expected to take any action yet. Mexico’s  president called a press conference on Monday at which he is  expected to discuss trade with the U.S.', '  Harris said it will be important to see how Trump deals with  China. Trump in the past week said he would not label the  country a currency manipulator right away, as he threatened, and  that he would speak to Chinese officials first. Harris said China  has been trying to prevent its currency from falling, not pushing  it lower.', '  “Certainly Trump is going to want to do something that gets  China’s attention … something that kind of jolts the  negotiating process,” he said. “I don’t know whether that will be  what he does out of the gate. It could be after he waits for some  of the other stuff like the Affordable Care Act to go through. I  think it’s a first 100 days story.”', '  For the U.S. markets next week, Harris said fourth-quarter GDP  released on Friday will be important. He expects growth of 2.4  percent, a bit higher than consensus.', '  “Basically if you look at the broad data story right now, the  economy is showing a little sign of picking up. Confidence is  picking up. Some of this is optimism is about fiscal policy and  deregulation, and some of this was already happening in the data  before the election,” said Harris. He said Trump has so far been  a positive for the economy and now risks being negative if he is  too aggressive on trade. ', '  “He’s taking over at a pretty good time. The economy is at full  employment, wages are beginning to accelerate. You’re not in a  world where the Fed has to tighten too quickly. It is a positive  way to start,” Harris said. “Right or wrong, a president gets  credit for the economy. He is inheriting a good economy. Obama  inherited a disaster.”', '  Moore also said the economy was already kicking in to a better  gear before the election. ', '  “We actually think growth and reflation and momentum started  before the U.S. election. The market acknowledged the momentum,  and that turning point was super charged by the U.S. election,”  she said.', '  She’s looking to hear more from Trump on his plans. “It was not  perhaps the most optimistic presidential speech I’ve heard. I  think the real key is how Trump and his cabinet pivot to be truly  looking forward instead of just criticizing what has and hasn’t’  happened and perceived weakness in the U.S. economy,” she said.', 'What to Watch', '  Monday', 'Earnings: McDonald’s, , , Brown and Brown, Zions  Bancorp', 'Tuesday', 'Earnings:  , DuPont, Alibaba, SAP,  , , Corning, DR Horton, Kimberly-Clark,, AK Steel, Janus, Samsung Electronics,,  Alcoa, , Seagate ', '8:30 a.m. Philadelphia Fed non manufacturing', '  9:45 a.m. Markit manufacturing PMI', '  10:00 a.m. Existing home sales', 'Wednesday', 'Earnings: Boeing, , Abbott Labs,  ,  Textron, , eBay,  Qualcomm, Citrix, WW Grainger, Las Vegas Sands, Cullen/Frost Bankers,,  McKesson, Norfolk Southern', '9:00 a.m. FHFA home price index', 'Thursday ', 'Earnings: Microsoft, Alphabet, Caterpillar, , , Fiat Chrysler, Unilever, Biogen, ,  Blackstone, Praxair, Potash, Alaska Air, , LM Ericsson,   , Southwest Air,  ', '8:30 a.m. Jobless claims', '  9:45 a.m. Markit services PMI', '  10:00 a.m. New home sales', 'Friday', 'Earnings: ,  Honeywell, ,, Air Products  ', '8:30 a.m. Durable goods', '  8:30 a.m. Q4 Real GDP', '  10:00 a.m. Consumer sentiment', '', ' ']",-1

They may finally get their wish—if opposition parties win  the presidential election.', ' Crony capitalism linked to chaebols is a major issue in  Asia’s fourth-largest economy, as reflected in an ongoing  political scandal that threatens to impeach President Park  Geun-hye. Park and her close friend, civilian Choi Soon-sil, are  accused of pressuring the nation’s biggest enterprises, including  Samsung, Lotte, SK Group, and Hyundai, to contribute to  foundations that backed Park’s programs. Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong was accused  of paying bribes worth $36.42 million to Choi but on  Thursday, a Seoul judge dismissed a warrant to arrest  him.', '  “Seriously tackling the chaebol will require political, not just  legal, action. A lot of these executives have been convicted,  only to be pardoned,” Robert Kelly, associate professor at  Pusan National University, told CNBC.', '  Analysts say prosecutors will go after Lotte or Hyundai next if a  clear trail of evidence is found. The offices of Lotte and SK  Group were raided in November as part of the probe but no charges  have yet been made. Lotte chairman Shin Dong-bin was  indicted in October for a separate corruption investigation  involving financial crimes, but avoided arrest.', '  Kelly, like many others, believe chaebol reform will finally  materialize when the public elects a left-leaning president.', '  “A new government under a left-of-center president would likely  accelerate efforts to achieve that goal,” echoed Scott Seaman,  senior Asia analyst at Eurasia, in a recent note. Opposition  parties, such as the Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s  Party, have long been discussing legislation to strengthen  anti-monopoly and fair trade laws aimed at reducing the excessive  wealth and influence of chaebols, he explained.', '  An election for the five-year single-term presidency is scheduled  for Dec. 20 but if a court approves Park’s impeachment  motion, elections could be held within the next 60 days. The  country’s Constitutional Court has until June 21 to make a  decision.', '  The leftist candidates in the running include Moon Jae-in from  the opposition Democratic Party and Seongnam Mayor Lee  Jae-myung of the opposition Minjoo Party. According to a Real  Meter poll of 2,525 surveyed adults released on Jan. 9, Moon  obtained an approval rating of 26.8 percent, the highest among  any candidate.', ' Park’s conservative Saenuri party on the other hand  may be less willing to crack down on chaebols as it has  traditionally been closer to the nation’s family dynasties,  flagged Kelly.', '  Chaebols dominate the Korean economy, with each company operating  a range of diverse businesses. Hyundai for example  is home to the world’s 5th largest automaker, the 15th largest  container shipping firm and the 13th biggest steel producer in  addition to manufacturing construction equipment and solar  panels, among other goods.', '  Sales revenue generated by the top five chaebols were equivalent  to 58 percent of gross domestic product in 2015, according to  statistics from the National University of Singapore.', '  Even before Park’s case, public resentment against chaebols was  high, with special focus on the economic and social privileges  enjoyed by founding families. In 2014, the vice-president of national carrier Korean Air sparked a  public uproar by delaying a flight because she was angry  at the flight attendant for serving macadamia nuts in a paper bag  instead of a plate.', '  Families running chaebols control a vast network of companies  through a circular holding structure and their control rights  typically exceed cash-flow rights, so families often wield undue  influence over group companies in spite of small direct  shareholdings.', '  But some skeptics believe sweeping reform may be too ambitious,  regardless of who wins the election.', '  “As much as presidential candidates want to tell the people what  they want to hear, their campaign promises rarely match up with  what they are able to accomplish once they are in office,”  remarked Steven Ward, assistant professor at Chosun University.', '  Moreover, chaebols will fight tooth-and-nail against any  restrictive policies so the next President may choose to  side-step a public confrontation by reviving talk of  prosecutorial reform instead, an area where they stand a better  chance of success, Ward continued.', '  The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office isn’t considered truly  independent from politics and has also been embroiled in numerous  scandals. In 2012, a senior prosecutor was arrested on charges of  bribery while a junior prosecutor admitted to having sexual  relations with a female suspect in his office.', ' —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.']",-1

', '  In the biggest shift from his past plans, Trump said he would  seek three income tax brackets of 33 percent, 25 percent and 12  percent, but did not outline which income levels would pay each rate. He previously sought a top rate of 25 percent versus the  current rate of nearly 40 percent. ', '  “The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much  that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability as a nation to  compete,” Trump said in the speech at the Detroit Economic Club.', '  Trump paused several times as  protesters interrupted.

A group of more than a dozen women claimed to be behind the disruptions, protesting a past comment that he would move auto plants out of Michigan. ', '  The remarks came as the Trump campaign looked to refocus after a  series of gaffes by the billionaire developer. Trump has  repeatedly claimed he is better suited to steer the American  economy than Democrat Hillary Clinton, and respondents in recent polls have  narrowly favored Trump as more prepared to do so. ', '  Trump did not go into painstaking detail on his policies or  explain how he will trim spending to offset the lost revenue from  tax cuts. He said he will offer more detail on his proposals “in  the coming weeks.” ', '  Trump pledged to protect American industries like auto manufacturing, steel and coal, saying his policies will create “millions of good-paying  jobs.” He said he had “the campaign of the future” without mentioning technological innovation. Trump tried to contrast his plans to what he called “the  job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.”', '  In a statement ahead of Trump’s speech Monday, Clinton’s campaign  bashed his proposals. ', '  “The core of Donald Trump’s economic plan involves reckless tax  cuts that will add trillions to the debt to benefit the wealthy,  Wall Street, and big corporations,” Clinton policy advisers Jake  Sullivan, Maya Harris and Jacob Leibenluft wrote in a statement.  “Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to lead — and would  tear our country apart with his dangerous ideas, divisive  rhetoric, and history of harming hardworking Americans.”', '  Clinton is slated to give an economic speech of her own on  Thursday. A Moody’s analysis of both plans  said Clinton would bring a “somewhat stronger” economy while  Trump would cause a “lengthy recession.” ', '  Trump largely rehashed previous pledges to cut business taxes,  renegotiate trade deals and reverse climate-related executive  actions issued under President Barack Obama. But he rolled out new wrinkles  in the speech, like putting a moratorium on “new agency  regulations” and making child care tax deductible. ', '  “It is time to remove the anchor that is dragging us down. And  that’s what it’s doing, it’s dragging us down,” Trump said about  “over-regulation” of the U.S. economy.', '  Trump said he wants to ensure the wealthy “pay their fair share”  while reducing taxes for the middle and working class.

(And entirely devoid of  women.)', 'Instead, his economic circle — as he promised — is a  bit, shall we say, less typical. The prominent of the  not-so-prominent list of economists includes only one Ph.D.,  Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California,  Irvine and longtime opponent of free trade who blames China for  America’s economic ills; Stephen Moore, a flat-tax advocate who  co-founded the anti-tax group Club for Growth; and David Malpass,  a consultant and former chief economist at Bear Stearns.', '  The group is heavy on moguls and would-be moguls — all, of  course, Trump donors. Among them are Steven Roth, a real estate  mogul who owns a building with Mr. Trump; Harold Hamm, the  billionaire wildcatter; John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge  fund manager; Steve Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus, the  private equity firm; and Dan DiMicco, former president and chief  executive of the steel company Nucor Corporation, who has been  vocal about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United  States.', ' More from The New York Times:Trump’s Economic Team: Bankers and Billionaires (and All  Men)Donald Trump, Hoping to Change Subjects, Says He Will  Bring ProsperityCanClinton or Trump Recapture Robust American Growth?', '  Wilbur Ross, the famed venture capitalist, was left off the  original list but later added on Trump’s website; Mr. Ross said  that his team hadn’t gotten back to the candidate in time to be  included last week.', '  And for those keeping score, Carl Icahn, the activist investor  and longtime Trump backer, said he was left off the list so he  could start a “super PAC,” which he said would not be allowed if  he were a formal member of the campaign.', '  Then again, Mr. Trump has made a virtue of his lack of  traditional support, depicting himself as an anti-establishment  candidate willing to make difficult choices. He sent a tweet  saying as much earlier this week, showing a picture of him and  Ms. Clinton under the headline “Campaign Contributions from Hedge  Funds.” It showed Ms. Clinton received $48.5 million from the  hedge fund industry while Mr. Trump received only $19,000.  “Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors,” he  wrote.', '  The tweet and his economics council are a bit of mixed message,  given that he is trying to raise money from the financial  industry and clearly has some support — even some from  traditional Republican circles. On Monday, for instance, George  P. Bush, the son of Jeb (who is anti-Trump) came out in favor of  the Republican candidate, urging all party members to support Mr.  Trump.', '  Mr. Trump’s challenge is he is trying to be two things at the  same time: distinctly anti-elite yet absolutely elite. This is  particularly tough given he wants to be seen as a successful  billionaire businessman while also being an outsider trying to  work for the little guy.', '  That said, while Mr. Trump may relish his unconventional group,  he has been quietly trying to get some more establishment voices  to join him.', '  But many of the most prominent Republican donors have been doing  their best to avoid associating with him. Stephen Schwarzman,  co-founder of the Blackstone Group, met with Mr. Trump, but has  so far refused to donate or publicly support him, according to  people briefed on the meeting.', '  Henry Kravis, who historically has voted for Republicans and  donated money to them, has been relatively silent. (When Mr.  Trump floated his name for Treasury secretary, Mr. Kravis said,  “That was scary when he said that.”)', '  Ken Griffin, the founder of Citadel, would seem like a natural  Trump supporter, given that he describes himself as a “Reagan  Republican.” He has donated to Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott  Walker, but not to Mr. Trump.', '  Cliff Asness, the billionaire founder of AQR, an investment  management firm, has historically supported Republicans, but  called Mr. Trump “a disaster for the G.O.P. and for the country.”  In March, he seemed to bend a little, saying, “I have to keep a  more open mind,” but his spokesman said on Monday that he hadn’t  changed his position.', '  Paul Singer, one of the biggest Republican donors, has been part  of the #NeverTrump campaign, saying his policies would be “a  guarantee of a global depression.”', '  The list goes on. Seth Klarman, who runs the hedge fund Baupost,  has often supported Republicans even though he is an independent.  Last week he issued a blistering statement about Mr. Trump while  throwing his weight behind Mrs. Clinton.', '  “His words and actions over the last several days are so  shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society  that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our  president,” Mr. Klarman said.', '  Traditional Republican economists have also kept their distance.  Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, who served  as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President  George W. Bush, wrote, “The anti-trade and anti-immigration  policies of Mr. Trump portend a slower-growth future for all  Americans, and middle- and lower-income Americans in particular.”', '  Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economist who succeeded Mr. Hubbard as  chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers and  also advised Mitt Romney, said of Mr. Trump: “He will not be  getting my vote. I have Republican friends who think that things  couldn’t be worse than doubling down on Obama policies under  Hillary Clinton. And, like them, I am no fan of the left’s agenda  of large government and high taxes. But they are wrong: Things  could be worse. And I fear they would be under Mr. Trump.”', '  Mr. Ross, a Trump supporter, said he thought the candidate’s  economic speech in Detroit on Monday might prove to be a positive  turning point. “He did a very good job,” Mr. Ross said after the  speech. “If he just stuck to that, he’d be in a lot better  shape.”', '  Mr. Ross called Mr. Trump “substantive” and said he was  particularly impressed by “the whole way he reacted to the staged  demonstrators.” It was “mature” of Mr. Trump to refrain from  taking the bait and getting angry, Mr. Ross said.', '  The question is, if Mr. Trump adjusts his behavior over the next  several weeks, will some of those establishment names come join  his anti-establishment band?']",-1

And it will pick up on the mandate  of CEO Akio Toyoda, who has called on his designers to put more  “passion” in Toyota designs. New LED headlights and tail lamps  are likely. To maximize range, Toyota is expected to reveal it  has adopted new lightweight manufacturing techniques, including  the use of more advanced steel alloys, aluminum, perhaps even  some composite materials.', '  Meanwhile, the Prius is expected to get a more refined interior,  a move meant to address one of the most frequent criticisms of  the hybrid. There will almost certainly be more high-tech  features, including an improved infotainment system and possibly  a wireless cellphone charger.', '  There have been some reports suggesting Toyota may offer an  optional lithium-ion battery pack as an upgrade in an effort to  improve fuel economy and all-electric range. Toyota has been  doggedly sticking with older nickel-metal hydride batteries,  which it considers safer and more reliable, and it remains  unclear if those reports are accurate.', '  Until now, lithium batteries have only been offered in the  slow-selling Prius Plug-in Hybrid, recently pulled from U.S.  showrooms.

Sintesa is an  Indonesian conglomerate that is made up of 17 distinct companies:  consumer goods distribution, prefab concrete, energy production,  steel manufacturing and real estate. The business took root three  generations ago when Kamdani’s grandfather started a rubber  plantation.', '  As we stood on the roof of the Sintesa headquarters in downtown  Jakarta and looked at the skyline of office buildings, 48-year  old Kamdani described what the city was like just a few decades  ago. She remembers the area as farmland. Today, a major portion  of the buildings was built using her company’s concrete. “You can  really see true development….from nothing to something,” she  said.', '  High Expectations', '  Kamdani always knew she would be handed the reigns to the family  business which has grown to 6,000 employees. Her only other  sibling, her sister, is an artist with no interest in running  operations. Kamdani was given full control of the company in 1999  after the Asian financial crisis. She shook things up by not only  changing the name of the company from Tigaraksa to Sintesa, but  also changing the corporate structure.', '  “This is quite a challenge. What I am trying to do is to get away  from the focus of a one man show, or what I call a ‘family  business,’ just around one owner,” she said. “So we have now an  organization in which it’s run by an executive  committee…This is a team of people.”', '  Kamdani’s father is still involved with Sintesa as chief  commissioner. She goes to both her parents as a sounding board on  business decisions.', '  “I still find that I want my parents to be proud of me….So  there is always that big push (inside me). I want to prove that  just because they don’t have a son, that doesn’t mean they don’t  have anybody to continue the business properly,” she said.', 'Read MoreAsia’s richest entrepreneurs under 40', '  In the corporate world, Kamdani is breaking just about every  glass ceiling. She was recently asked to be an adviser to  Indonesia’s vice president. She says it’s a huge honor especially  considering who she is.  “People say I am a triple minority  in Indonesia. I am a non-Muslim. I am a Chinese. I am a woman.  That is an important journey for me.”', ' Nurturing Other Entrepreneurs', '  While Kamdani manages her own business, she also has her eye on  the landscape for Indonesia’s entrepreneurs. She doesn’t want to  be alone at the top. She wants others to join her –  especially women.', '  “Actually a woman entering the labor force at the moment has been  progressing very well. The problem is they don’t want to go into  the leadership positions. And why is that? It’s because they  don’t want to impact their family life,” lamented Kamdani, a  mother of three.  “We need to create more women leaders.  Women sitting on boards right now (are a) very small (minority)  in Indonesia. So we are trying to create a network and support  system.”', '  Kamdani believes there are three major obstacles for  entrepreneurs: access to markets, access to financing and  limitations to building out their ideas.  Several years ago,  Kamdani and other business leaders started an angel investment  fund in which they listen to start-up business pitches and decide  which entrepreneurs to fund.', '  Kamdani has also focused on helping women in rural areas.   She says it’s often difficult for poor women to get  personal financing because they need their husband’s formal  approval. Essentially, it’s a cultural mindset that needs to  change.', '  “That is a very big issue for a woman wanting to start their  business.  They have to rely on their husband so they can  never be independent on their own. It’s not just about empowering  the woman but also educating the men.”', ' Read MoreSingapore entrepreneurs warm up to  ‘renting desks’', '  Kamdani’s desire to help entrepreneurs stems from a traumatic  time in Indonesia’s recent history. Inflation, food shortages and  a banking crisis all contributed to the May 1998 riots that  ultimately targeted Chinese Indonesians. When the violence was  over, more than 500 people had died with hundreds of homes and  businesses destroyed. Kamdani worked with a priest to help  identify families who needed to build up their businesses again.', '  “I started micro financing with them. Instead of just giving  money, we started developing some of their business. Something  that is lost completely can be rebuilt,” she recounted.', '  For more on Shinta Widjaja Kamdani’s interview, tune in to  Entrepreneur Asia: Power Players on CNBC.

Cultivated or cultured meats are real animal products made in labs and commercial production facilities. Right now, the process is costly, but researchers and entrepreneurs say over time manufacturing will become more efficient and less expensive. If consumers switch to cultivated meat, it could help reduce greenhouse gases from agriculture and ease climate change.', '“This isn’t inevitable,” Tetrick said in an interview. “This could take 300 years or it could take 30 years. It’s up to companies like ours to do the real work of building the engineering capabilities ... and communicate directly with consumers about what it is and isn’t, and how it can benefit their lives.”', 'Investors have poured some $2 billion into the space in the last two years, according to Crunchbase data. The year ahead will bring more investment. Eat Just and others are working to win regulatory approval in the United States from the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture.', 'Nick Cooney, managing partner at LeverVC, which invests in the sector, said he expects approval as early as this year.', '“There are several companies in this space that are building out large pilot scale facilities to produce cultivated meat products, but to produce at quite significant volumes, that’s going to involve a lot of capex, a lot of steel, and that’s just going to take time,” he said.', 'Eat Just has had big breakthroughs over the past two years. In Singapore, it received its first regulatory approval in December 2020 for its Good Meat cultured chicken and it has since been approved to sell new types of cultivated chicken there, including chicken breast, tenders and shredded chicken products.', '“It is real meat,” Tetrick said. “And instead of needing billions of animals and all the land and the water, and all the rain forests you typically need to knock down to make that happen, we start with a cell. You can get the cell from a biopsy of an animal, a fresh piece of meat or a cell bank. Now, we don’t need the animal anymore. Then, we identify nutrients needed to feed that cell and ... we make it in a stainless steel vessel called a bioreactor.”', 'Eat Just also sells plant-based egg products made from mung beans in stores including Whole Foods and Publix in the U.S., and it employs more than 200 people.', 'To date, it says, more than 700 people in Singapore have been served its cultivated meat products — a number Tetrick hopes to rapidly scale up as it receives approvals in other countries.', 'Once approved, Eat Just said it has already laid the groundwork to hit the ground running. The company’s Good Meat division announced a $267 million capital raise last year to build vessels and systems that will ramp up production in both the U.S. and Singapore, where it currently manufactures, with the goal of having that equipment operational in the next two years. It also announced in August it would be building a facility in Qatar, in partnership with Doha Venture Capital and Qatar Free Zones Authority, but much more capital will be needed to build bioreactors large enough to scale up.', 'According to nonprofit research advocacy group The Good Food Institute, there are more than 100 start-ups working on cultivated meat products, and larger companies are also ramping up their own operations.', 'JBS, the global protein giant, acquired BioTech Foods in late 2021, investing $100 million to enter the cultivated meat market and build a research and development center in Brazil. The Spanish biotech company is another leader in the cultivated food space, focusing on developing biotechnology for producing cultivated meats.', 'These developments come as consumers have shown increased concern about climate change and a desire to change their eating habits to fight it. Plant-based meat products have become more ubiquitous, popping up on menus like KFC’s or showing up in the grocery aisle at Target. Cultivated meat could provide Americans with another alternative and could coexist with products made by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.', '“The world will not get to net-zero emissions without addressing food and land,” said Caroline Bushnell, vice president of corporate engagement at the Good Food Institute.', '“Our food system’s role on climate change is generally underappreciated, but industrial animal agriculture is a major contributor,” she said. “Alternative proteins, including cultivated meat, can be a key aspect of how we reduce the emissions from our food system. It won’t be possible to actually to meet our obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement unless industrial meat production goes down.”', 'Chef Jose Andres, a restaurateur and founder of nonprofit humanitarian group World Central Kitchen, wants to be part of that solution. Last month, he joined the board of Eat Just’s Good Meat division and has pledged to sell its cultivated chicken at one of his U.S. restaurants pending regulatory review.', 'Promises like that can help move Tetrick closer to his vision. But costs also have have to come down as well.', '“A local diner or a big fast food chain is not going to take this if it’s a whole lot more expensive than conventional meat. They’re going to take it when it’s close — or even better, when it’s below the cost. And that’s what we need to fight for,” Tetrick said.', 'Correction: A quote was misattributed to Jose Andres.
